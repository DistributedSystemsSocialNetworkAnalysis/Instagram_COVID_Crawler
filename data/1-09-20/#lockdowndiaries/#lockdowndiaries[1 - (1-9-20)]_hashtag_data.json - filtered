From next week, I am going to start working from office fully. Since April, I was working from home. Started going to office from June, 2\/3 days in a week. My work space is open area where we all the team members and other departments sit at the same floor. \nI used to feel that being an introvert, having a seperate work station would be better for me. After the general holidays for Covid-19, I got the chance to work in the comfort of my own room. However, that did not work well for me. Though we all the team members always connected, it felt something is missing. Was not also motivated enough mainly due to the whole pandemic situation. Actually, I was so used to with my office space that the sudden change did not feel right. Also, no matter how many con call we do, never felt much connected with all my colleagues and team members. I tried to make my home work space cozy and convenient. For any analytical work, I think working from home is better for me to focus deeply. But overall, my office experience keeps me motivated. Feeling so good that I am going back to my normal routine which I never thought to crave so much 😄😄😄😄. We will attend all the meeting virtually and will have to maintain every safety measures to be safe at the time of corona. But it is good that we are atleast trying to get back to normal life. \n\nIn this photo, this is my cozy litter work space at home when I have to work long hour on financial data. 😊😊😊\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#livethelittlethings #photosinbetween\n#fromabove #onmytable #tablesituation  #onthetableproject #flatlayforever #flatlaystyle #flatlay #flatlayoftheday \n#covid19\n#coronatime #pandemic2020 #mylife2020 #mylifeinpandemic #myeveryday #2020 #everyday2020 #coronatimediary #lockdown2020 #lockdowndiaries #workfromhome #newnormal #worklife #investmentbankerlife","NumberOfLikes":7,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @miracle_ishere on September 01, 2020.

Optimally, a mere several hours! \nThis Orange and Apricot almond flour cake is gluten-free, bursting with a striking citrus flavour and has a ravishing texture, swathed with melted jam and a generous sprinkling of dessicated coconut.\nIt is nobly unassuming with its intense citrusy notes, seductively intoxicating and saturated with the virtuous flavours of butter for a delicate, luxuriously moist sponge. \n.\nI would take a slice, maybe three, and quietly sit snugly by the log fire, blurring any gloom from the overcast and travel vicariously to a charming Parisian cafè.\n. \nDo look out for a short video on my stories.\nYou can also tap the link in bio to shop my cookbook.🙂\n.\nFollow @foodiesof_cakewalk for more photos and ideas\/recipes.

They legit teach us which news should we cover 1st and by that law GDP is more important always!!\nLastly i just want to say I don\u2019t have any faith in our national TV media. We\u2019re on our own!! Share this with those people who still think National TV news media is neutral and best!!\nThank you..\nBig shoutout to @fayedsouza for showing news that really matters!!\nLet me know your views on it in comment section!!\n.\n.\n#sushantsinghrajput #ssr #news #indianmedia #arnabgoswami \n#lockdown #lockdowndiaries #india #covidera #maharashtra #aurangabad #ahmednagar #trending #nashik #pune #mumbai #nagpur #kolhapur #hyderabad #indore #thane #ahmedabad #delhi #chennai #kolkata #banglore #ndtv #republicnewschannel #gdp","NumberOfLikes":144,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1598940598,"LocalDate":"Tue Sep 01 08:09:58 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Kishor ❤️ Manisha\nWedding celebration\n@sanket_gadakh_photography_offi \n#marathmoli #king #Beautiful #queen \n#marathijodi #couple #kolhapuri_life_style #puneri #punerispacial #puneriladies #puneridiaries😉😎😘😍 #punerilagna #kolhapuristyle #kolhapurisaaj #kashtasaree #navari #navardev #couple #coronaweddings2020 #lockdowndiaries #lockdown2020 #lockdownlife #naturephotography #likeforlikes #streetart #streetphotography #awesome #awesome_photographers #awesomeclick \n+91 96 89 28 65 52","NumberOfLikes":170,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Sanket gadakh in Sinner Nashik with @shevkarajit, @kolhapuriwear, @kahandalkaran, @shevkarkishor, @marathi_lagna_sohala, @shevkar.ajit, and @kolhapuri_concept_mho9.

It's been wonderful to see so many of my precious people, despite the awkward elbow bumps and huglessness. It was also most interesting to see how my fellow Dutchfolk are coping with the ongoing health crisis, and, more tellingly, the associated government restrictions. The Dutch sure love their liberalism and freedoms, their laissez faire ideals, and sure get contrary when authorities try and undermine those. They get a lot more vocally contrary about it than what I've heard from the good people of Northern Ireland. A lot more petulant, obstinate and whiney. But as I take my leave from here today, I know I'll miss my free-spirited, free-thinking, rebellious compatriots.

And I added some quartered onions instead of the recipe\u2019s onion powder, and I added some bokchoy simply because I had two of them desiccating slowly in the fridge!

We are all thrilled to leave the house\/ city after 5 months at home! However, it was definitely not all bad, the girls (and us!) also learned a lot from staying home.\n- Every Sunday we \u2018travelled to a country from home\u2019. We watched movies, did STEM activities, made crafts and ate food from the specific country. It was fun and educational. I will definitely continue doing this as part of a trip preparation in the future. It really allows the kids (and us) to be better informed of a certain destination!!\n- The girls spend a lot of time together (this will continue of course, as school will not start any time soon). Although they already were pretty close, I believe they grew even closer. \n- We all took more responsibilities in doing house chores (we used to have somebody cleaning our house, but we definitely will not have anybody until the end of the pandemic). The girls organize their room and clean\/ wash their toys etc. I think this should stay this way.\nIn other words, I don\u2019t think the girls will remember the pandemic as something traumatic, but as a nice (and educational) time spend together at home (of course they are also thrilled to leave a house ). \n@prilaga #girls #lama #prilaga #llamas #family #familyday #sisterforever #familytime #llama #lockdowndays #woneninhetbuitenland #lockdownfun #beautifuldestinations #fun #sweet #lockdown #lockdowndiaries #lockdownlife #loveher #lockdown2020","NumberOfLikes":44,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Anna Lavooi on August 31, 2020.

As a child whenever I thought about my arangetram, I had this costume in mind and I wanted something very similar to a Mohiniattam costume. When I had a word with the tailor he had a confused look on his face and told me to stitch a normal saree instead because it was quite risky for an arangetram saree. Also my guru was not really happy with my costume in the beginning, but on the day of my arangetram after my performance, she said that this costume was my best choice and it looked amazing on stage!\nAnd so I thought of wearing this costume today for Onam and think about all the good times I had with it✨\n\nDance Style : Bharatnatyam & Mudra Tutting\n🎥 : @namritha.nirav 🥺❤️\n\n#kuttanad #punjayile #kjyesudas #vidyavox #onamspecial #onamashamsakal #bharatnatyam #mudratutting #dancevideos #explorepage #oldandnew #song #blackandwhite #transition #vintage #feels #onestepatatime #recoveringdays #videooftheday #lockdowndiaries #dancing #instagood #happy #positivevibesonly","NumberOfLikes":467,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":66,"Timestamp":1598857244,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 31 09:00:44 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Mermaid!\n.\n.\n4th entry  #augustwatercolorists2020 \nPrompt Fantasy\n.\nMaterials used:\nPaper: @brustro_official 300gsm 100% cotton cold pressed watercolor paper\nPaints: @brustro_official watercolors\nBrush: @raphael_brushes softAqua\n.\n.\n#mermaid #mermaids #sea #bluesea\n#lockdowndiaries #paintfromhome #watercolour #watercolors #watercolorartist #watercoloring #watercolorart #watercolorsketch #watercolorillustration #watercolor_guide #artistsoninstagram #artoninstagram #artofinstagram \n#emergingartists #indianartist #globalsketchers #young_artist_help #watercolorbeginner  #indiaartists #water_lesson\n#instaart\n#artistotj","NumberOfLikes":111,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Tejaswi on August 29, 2020 tagging @artopium_bongsbelleza, @vivivacolors, @theartindustry.in, @artyshils_art_brushes, @world_of_water_colours_, @mr_watercolour, @watercolor_daily, and @drawing.pigment.","NumberOfComments":32,"Timestamp":1598725506,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 29 20:25:06 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"As the saying goes- health is wealth and this holds true now more than ever. \n.\n.\nMay it be a small corner or an entire room, home gyms are here to stay and we\u2019re here to help you get that perfect background for that must-have workout selfie. \n.\n.\nInteriors by #EmpireDesigns \nDesign Lead: Idr.

While reading always dominated my schedule, writing took a back seat as I found myself entangled in the worldly and mundane tasks. When the pandemic knocked our doors, I was obviously worried like any other sane human being. However, eventually, when life settled into a routine, I started musing again. I started writing proses and poems like I used to when I was in school. Writing gives me respite, a much needed outlet to the commotion of thoughts that constantly runs in my mind. The colorful ink on the paper motivates me to pen down my ideas and my desires in the forms of rhymes. It helps me disengage and find my own, personal paradise.\"\n\n#BbKk #edtimestories #hobbies #lockdowndiaries #writing #bookworm #reading #respite #fictionalworld #creativity #dantealighieri","NumberOfLikes":7,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by ED Times on August 31, 2020 tagging @friendlybibliophile.

It was cramped and, with a large pot under fire right there, it was steamy and smelly.\n\nSo here I was, out on an unnamed side street in San Agustin in Iloilo proper.\n\nThe place was\/is called Salam-ukan, in Tagalog nabulunan, in English, choke.\n\nAnd OMG, the best nilaga!\n\nCarabao meat boiled for four hours til tender in soup enriched with lemon, lemongrass, a big, bold red hot chili in every bowl, and a secret mix of five herbs.\n\nThe whole thing was run like witchcraft, the man behind it, Boyet Susvilla, a kind of mangkukulam, but substitute the word with \"manglalaga,\" the one who cooks nilaga.\n\nOnly Boyet knew the five-herb secret, not his ex-wife, not his companion, not any of his four children. \"I will share the secret with them when I die,' he told me.\n\nBut which of the kids would be the keeper of the secret, the one true manglalaga? Only time will tell.\n\nBoyet came upon this amazing broth at a makeshift kitchen and table in a bangketa in Iloilo City on Nov. 8, 2013, just as Typhoon Yolanda was about to leave a huge swath of destruction across southern Philippines.\n\nHis cook did not make it to work. Clumsily, he tried to boil the stuff on his own, getting directions from his cook by phone, the phone exchange, as you might assume, was erratic at best, completely unreliable, so he was forced to find his way about it, almost by accident, like when he spilled his Mountain Dew into a bowl of soup and there discovered lemon and lemongrass would do wonders.\n\nIn no time, his was the only bangketa eatery that had to issue numbered tickets to manage the queue of customers.\n\nLast year, in some branches like this, by 11 am the famous soup would be sold out.\n\nHis nilaga, at 50 pesos per bowl, was worth having to eat it by the gutter.\n\nBut what's become of Boyet the Manglalaga and his famous Salam-ukan?\n\n#IMissIloilo\n#salamukan \n#iloilo\n#quarantinejournal\n#lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":70,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by AA Patawaran in Iloilo City, Philippines.

So we decided to roll out a dough every other weekend to make sense of its existence and to heat up the good ol' rolling pin. Here's the dough, completely basic, mixed with water and salt,  slightly wet, spread as thin as possible on a non stick (oven proof) pan, started off like a Paratha on the stove, then loaded with toppings of your choice and finished off in the oven in another 10 mins. Toppings used are some bengali chicken cutlets from @licious_foods and last night's stirfry veggies with some grated cheddar. The result, the fridge cleaned up of the leftovers, quite a wholesome flatbread\/pizza and wheat finds a way back into our lives.\n.\n.\nPS: we aren't gluten intolerant. Just find roti sabzi very boring.:)\n.\n.\n#wholewheat #flatbread #flatbreadpizza #homecooking #homecooked #lockdowndiaries #leftoverfood #cookingthroughit #cookingiscoping #instafood #easyfood #zerowastetips","NumberOfLikes":18,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Amrita Mohanty on August 30, 2020.

They started with organizing a week long winter workshop for the kids which was loved and appreciated by many. The main idea behind starting HOLIDAZE was to let the kids explore various skills within themselves and let them move outside their comfort zone for which they included Dance, Art & Craft, Baking, Personality Development sessions & much more. \u2063\n\nWith a vision to keep organizing unique workshops for the kids they had huge plans for the summer, but due to the standstill caused by COVID-19 they had to find a different approach to keep the kids engaged. So HOLIDAZE came up with 'CRAFT YOUR WAY KITS' which includes craft materials, the tutorials and videos of which are later sent to the parents. 🥳🥳 \u2063\nWith many more plans ahead HOLIDAZE sure wants to mark its place in the market outside. ✨\u2063\n\u2063\nFollow @holidaze._ for more 🌸\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063𝐅𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐨𝐰 𝐮𝐬 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐜𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐕𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐠𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐬! 🌊\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\n𝐃𝐌 𝐮𝐬 𝐢𝐟 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐰𝐚𝐧𝐭 𝐭𝐨 𝐛𝐞 𝐚 𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐭 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐲 ♥️\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\n#whizofvizag #wov #holidaze #holidazeworkshop #craftyourway #homekit #artandcraft #lockdowndiaries #visakhapatnam #vizag #creativity #kids #newlearning #newiscool #crafts #funlearning #stayhome #staysafe #craft #newway #craftyourway #homekit #craftkit #vizagdiaries #children #artandcraft #colourful\u2063\n\u2063","NumberOfLikes":173,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":19,"Timestamp":1598770962,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 30 09:02:42 CEST 2020","Location":"Visakhapatnam"},{"CaptionText":"Sunday it is. 🤘❤️✌️👩\u200D🍳\nHomebaked Apple Cinnamon Cake. \n#applecinnamoncake #applecinnamon #baking101 #lockdowncooking #lockdowndiaries #oishii #foodporn #foodgasm #instafood #homebaked","NumberOfLikes":10,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ジェイエン  ピネーダー on August 29, 2020.

For me as a singer, it was all about rediscovering music in many ways.  For my six year old son Neel, it was finding passion and love for painting, thanks to his talented guide @ruxeena. And for my parents, it was some more time to visit their beautiful little piece of green treasure which they are taking care of and which in turn nourishes them and all of us. \n\nFeaturing here a beautifully tuned rare gem of a song, by Mahakavi Subramaniya Bharatiyar on Bhoomi Devi or Mother earth, set to tune by Dr Mangalampalli Balamuralikrishna in the regal ragam Simhendramadyamam, learnt from his student and my guru and mentor Aswathy Tirunal Rama Varma. \n\nThe paintings are done by Neel based on nature and also some beautiful videos from my dad's farm which has a butterfly zone amidst all the lush greenery. We can connect with nature in many ways. A little bit of gratitude and love for the mother who cares for us all, will go a very long way. These are few skills and experiences which we treasure for life. \n\nThankyou @chef_avin for tagging me and inspiring us to make this video. True artists connect in more than many ways.

I\u2019ve had a little break from social media this last week. We\u2019re still in hard lockdown over here; I\u2019ve lost count of what day we\u2019re up to. It\u2019s been a long time.\n\nHonestly, I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to come back to Instagram at all. There are a lot of really compelling arguments for abandoning social media altogether. I started writing a long post about the detrimental aspects of social media use, then ended up wondering why I\u2019m posting at all. Maybe I\u2019m contributing to the problem, maybe I still have an unhealthy relationship with my phone. I don\u2019t know. \n\nI do hope there is some value in adding a little beauty to the world in this space. Maybe despite all the ugliness and mess out there, it\u2019s still worthwhile to take a little time to celebrate the beautiful, the everyday small pleasures, the wholesome, the holy, the family. \n\n\u201CFor the rest, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever modest, whatsoever just, whatsoever holy, whatsoever lovely, whatsoever of good fame, if there be any virtue, if any praise of discipline, think on these things.\u201D\n\nPhilippians 4:8","NumberOfLikes":140,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Grace - Crafting Loveliness in Sunbury, Victoria.

Long or short term, it doesn\u2019t matter. My fitness transformation journey also started that way only. \n\nMy WORKOUT DIARY is my everything! I planned and drafted my workouts and wrote it down every single day. It\u2019s very important to track this record and it helped me in understanding the limits of my body as well. It just got better and better. These were the initial days of my fitness journey. \n\nI fixed my goal both long term and short term. Back then Long term was to be at my best fit which I\u2019m in right now. Short term goals were simple ones like for example 500 single under in a day to 550 or 600 the next day.

But then, in 1348, arriving in Italy from the Orient by way of the Silk Road, the pandemic happened, exacerbating the political and economic tensions, breaking down social hierarchies, and ultimately killing 25 million people.\n\nBut such a tragic end to what we refer to as the Dark Ages was also the beginning of the Renaissance, a period in which blossomed the arts, the sciences, as well as the idea of equality and prosperity for all.\n\nFast forward to the 21st century, our time, and we've had, over the past two decades at least, something similar to the handgun and its more sophisticated derivatives -- technology at our fingertips. It has since triggered seismic changes, shaking up the system, breaking down barriers, moving power from the establishment to the individual, exposing the chinks in the armor of the once all mighty.\n\nAnd then came Covid-19.\n\nBut as in the Middle Ages, there is a light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nBe not afraid.\n\nMethinks that, just like the Renaissance, just like its many inventions -- the printing press, the telescope, the clock, the microscope, astronomy, even alchemy -- it won't just be a rebirth, it will be the dawn of a life we have never known before.\n\n#hopespringseternal\n#historyrepeatsitself \n#dejavu\n#strangehistory \n#quarantinejournal\n#lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":39,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by AA Patawaran in Intramuros, Manila.
