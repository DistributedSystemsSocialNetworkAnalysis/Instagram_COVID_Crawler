For me it is having the time to enjoy the simple things in life, from watching nature change into its finest clothing has been a real joy, it has allowed a sense of connection with nature and wildlife on a deeper level. The time to share a chat with neighbours that we hardly ever spoke to before and the real camaraderie of sharing and helping one another is one that I hope will last into the future, it has been so comforting to know that others too have the time to converse and are willing to do so, rather than racing off to face another working day. These are all pretty simple things but have made a huge difference in peoples lives, especially those that live alone and long may it continue. I have added some of my drawings that I have been working on during this time, which is my way of using all the extra time to be creative which in turn helps to diffuse the impact of the pandemic. #contemporaryart #oilpastel #oilpastels #oilpastelonpaper #landscapedrawing #drawing #drawings #covid19 #covid_19 #covid  #lockdown #lockdown2020 #lockdownlife #lockdowndiaries #pandemic #pandemic2020 #wellbeing #wellbeingjourney #mindfulness #mindful","NumberOfLikes":96,"Hashtags":["#contemporaryart","#oilpastel","#oilpastels","#oilpastelonpaper","#landscapedrawing","#drawing","#drawings","#covid19","#covid_19","#covid","#lockdown","#lockdown2020","#lockdownlife","#lockdowndiaries","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#wellbeing","#wellbeingjourney","#mindfulness","#mindful"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Elaine Fox on August 25, 2020.

The lover of food and desserts, Lord Ganesha was returning home after having a hearty meal, when he stumbled and rolled over on his belly. The Moon saw it from high above, and burst into a cynical laughter that miffed Lord Ganesha, and compelled him to curse him. Lord Ganesha cursed the moon to disappear from the sky completely, while he begged for forgiveness. Ultimately, the generous Lord Ganesha gave in to his requests, but since he couldn't revoke the curse, he reduced the disappearance span of the moon from the sky to one day.\nLord Ganesha's story explains how anger gets to the best of us, but it is our power to overcome it that makes us a better human being.\n\n#bappamorya #ganeshmandala #mandalaartist #sakuragellyroll #sketch_fortress #mandalatutoriallovesmywork #feature_your_talent #planetofmandalas #brilliantmandalas #mandalasharingpage #potpourriofartists #artsyjayas #artlovesartlover #mandalafeaturingpage #crazyforsharingmandalas #lockdowndiaries #staysafe #staymotivated","NumberOfLikes":24,"Hashtags":["#ganpatibappamaurya","#bappamorya","#ganeshmandala","#mandalaartist","#sakuragellyroll","#sketch_fortress","#mandalatutoriallovesmywork","#feature_your_talent","#planetofmandalas","#brilliantmandalas","#mandalasharingpage","#potpourriofartists","#artsyjayas","#artlovesartlover","#mandalafeaturingpage","#crazyforsharingmandalas","#lockdowndiaries","#staysafe","#staymotivated"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Amandeep Kaur in India with @zenart.features, @_mandala_drawings, @mandalas.tahay, @dnbrothers_stationeryfineart, @i.love.sharing.mandala, @brilliant_mandalas, @mandalaloversofficial, @passion_creation_magic, @gammoartdreams, @worldwide.mandala, @diaryofmandalalovers, and @planetofmandalas.","NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598369314,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 17:28:34 CEST 2020","Location":"India"},{"Owner":"foodie_shreyaa","CaptionText":"Gulab Jamun 😋😋😋\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nFollow me @foodie_shreyaa\nFollow me @foodie_shreyaa\nUse #foodie_shreyaa to get featured \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#gulabjamun #gulabjamuns\n#desertlife\n#indiandesert #desertphotography\n#sweettooth #photoframes #lockdowndiaries  #photographerslife #photographers_of_indian\n#clickshot18mm #photographie\n#fotografia #photographyeveryday #photography📷 #birdlife_insta\n#photo_  #travelphotography #lockdown2020😷 #pictureoftheday #naturephotography #naturelove #phonephotography_id #instagrammers #food_mania #foodie_shreyaa","NumberOfLikes":227,"Hashtags":["#foodie_shreyaa","#gulabjamun","#gulabjamuns","#desertlife","#indiandesert","#desertphotography","#sweettooth","#photoframes","#lockdowndiaries","#photographerslife","#photographers_of_indian","#clickshot18mm","#photographie","#fotografia","#photographyeveryday","#photography📷","#birdlife_insta","#photo_","#travelphotography","#lockdown2020😷","#pictureoftheday","#naturephotography","#naturelove","#phonephotography_id","#instagrammers","#food_mania","#foodie_shreyaa"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Shreya's food_mania 🍕🥪🥘🍲 in Delhi, India with @patros_kitchen, @pratzstark, @tulis_food, @foodiefantacy, @up_eats, @photographersoffuzia, @food.lover.0.0, @instafood_sarita, @foodie_shreyaa, @foodiee._.girl, @_foodshala_, @joey.doesnt.share.food_xo, @foodie_pupp, @foodiezurich, @foo_dieforeever, @thefoodylife1, @recipesglobe, @born2eat.blog, @dazzling_food06, and @foodiesntraveller.

How sweet is that! \n.\nMy earliest memories of these little golden rings is from the time slot of childhood in Solan, Himachal Pradesh. After Sunday Church Service in a tiny chapel inside our school, my parents would walk us 3 ducklings along into the market. Then into a little street off to the left, a mithaiwalla stirring his kadhai of glistening oil, scooping out huge Punjabi samosas, like a magician from a cauldron. Inside his shop, in a setup of maybe 4 tables with 4 chairs each, my father would get us either the samosas with tangy imli chutney (so typically north Indian), or the hot jalebis in a katori with milk. Sometimes both. Oh happy days! \n.\nJalebis in hot milk. Delicious beyond dreams.\n.\nAlso known as zulbia, jilapi, mushabak and zalabia, JALEBI is an Arab & Indian sweet snack popular all over South Asia, and the Middle East. It is made by deep-frying all-purpose flour batter in circular shapes, which are then soaked in sugar syrup. This dessert can be served warm or cold.\n.\n.\nExperiments in the time of Covid19.

You could propel the curry with the welcome addition of most vegetables, most commonly exploited are, gravy-soaking potatoes or tender green peas. \n.\nThere are very willing ways to serve this curry, fluffy cumin basmati rice, soft rotis or scrumptious garlic naan breads to scoop up the spicy gravy.

It is an extremely personal moment between my grandma and myself. I tend to do it when I\u2019ve had chronic headaches, anxiety attacks or just a feeling of malaise! To be very honest, I\u2019m sure that it isn\u2019t very Islamic, it is rather more cultural. Nazar 🧿 or evil eye is an Islamic concept though, we acknowledge the evil from envy, jealousy or ill wishing. In islam you would rather protect yourself through prayers than other acts. \nThe Nazar isn\u2019t limited to Islamic cultures or countries, it is a greatly respected within Turkey, Greece, Cyprus and many other middle eastern countries.\nThe important discussion though, isn\u2019t if you believe in it or not. Rather, it is about whether you are open to people who have other beliefs than you. Can you make this world a safe space for them and their practices.

This year due to Pandemic the Ganesh Chaturthi celebration remains a bit low in profile. \nAs a kid I always use to celebrate this festival with so much enthusiasm. \n.\n.\nThis year's festival is special to me because for the very first time I made Bappa's favourite Ukadiche Modak. They weren't as perfect as it's done by using a mould but I enjoyed while making. I made these with shradha in my mind for Bappa. I don't think the shape and size matters infront of the shraddha which makes prasad heaven. \n.\n.\nWe know that Ganpati Bappa is like a friend so he will accept my modaks...\n(Oh my friend Ganesha tu rehena sath humesha)\n.\n.\nI really want to visit Maharashtra at time of Ganesh Utsav to see the happiness that joy in people.\n.\n.\nIn Odisha we celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi a bit different. Like we offer God Boondi Laddoo and  Chudaghasa ( means Chivda powdered with sugar and bit of cardamom) prasad mixed with boondi , sev and fruits. It's different from Modak.\nBut this time I offered Bappa his favourite Modak which made me happy from inside.\n.\n.\nAnd yes this is my contribution to #ganeshchaturthiincovid.

Then horror which we used to read in past came in reality for this generation... Pandemic. \nLockdown was imposed in short interval notice and in a snap sound of fingers, many found themselves jobless, trapped inside. Privileged as me just had to get ourselves keep confined to our spaces. Real struggle was for them whose life started daily with sunrise and bread earned by long day hard work. Now there was no work.\nAs a photographers' perspective, shoots got cancelled, project delayed or denied. After a few days of not shooting, we started searching way to pursue passion. Business meetings started on conference video calls. Few photographers came with a temporary solution of shooting on video calls. Facetime shoots, WhatsApp Call shoots, Google video shoots, Skype shoot came in existence... in a shell, Virtual Shoots. Ofcourse not good as actual shoot, but \"...dil ko khush rakhne ko ghalib ye khayal achchha hai...\", it became a trend amongst photographers.\nAfter initial denial, me too thought to give it a try. Talked to few people connected with me. Now I am sharing few results. \nI won't call myself as Photographer for these shots, just a director. \n--- \u2022\u2022\u2022 ---\nIn picture: @dikshadesire\n--- \u2022\u2022\u2022 ---\n#virtual #shoot #virtualshoot #facetime #facetimephotoshoot #whatsapp #videocall #portrait_vision #pictureoftheday #photooftheday #pursuitofportraits #portrait_today #portrait_mood #portraitphotography #portrait_shots #portraiture #mood #moodygrams #snapseed #lockdowndiaries #lockdown #coronatime #portraitvision_ #pr0ject_uno #pr0ject_soul #portraitphotographer #couch #red #relax #relaxing","NumberOfLikes":38,"Hashtags":["#virtual","#shoot","#virtualshoot","#facetime","#facetimephotoshoot","#whatsapp","#videocall","#portrait_vision","#pictureoftheday","#photooftheday","#pursuitofportraits","#portrait_today","#portrait_mood","#portraitphotography","#portrait_shots","#portraiture","#mood","#moodygrams","#snapseed","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdown","#coronatime","#portraitvision_","#pr0ject_uno","#pr0ject_soul","#portraitphotographer","#couch","#red","#relax","#relaxing"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598110660,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 17:37:40 CEST 2020","Location":"India"},{"Owner":"nurifakier","CaptionText":"Homemade takeaways...\n#Saturdays \n#Supper \n#homemade \n#gatsbyroll \n#viennaandchipsgatsby\n#CapeTown \n#lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":13,"Hashtags":["#Saturdays","#Supper","#homemade","#gatsbyroll","#viennaandchipsgatsby","#CapeTown","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598110600,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 17:36:40 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"iamamarr4","CaptionText":"If you are PERSISTENT you will get it.\nIf you are CONSISTENT you will keep it.\n.\n.\n#bodybuilding #transformation #gymlovers #bodyfitness #fitnessmotivation #fitnessjourney #fitnessgoals2020 #ziddihoonmain #asitisnutrition #lockdownlife #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":60,"Hashtags":["#bodybuilding","#transformation","#gymlovers","#bodyfitness","#fitnessmotivation","#fitnessjourney","#fitnessgoals2020","#ziddihoonmain","#asitisnutrition","#lockdownlife","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Amar on August 22, 2020.

: \nPerhaps the biggest learning during the lockdown has been how nature has begun to heal itself while reclaiming its rightful stature which had been historically abused by humans. That is what came to mind when I saw a car parked outside my home covered in leaves within the first month of the lockdown in April. Considering vehicular pollution has caused serious damage to the environment for so long, it was only fitting that nature finally took over and restored balance. Here's hoping that this balance is respected as and when we enter the 'new normal' in a post-lockdown world.\n\n#lockdowndiaries #museocamera @dahuez #photography","NumberOfLikes":13,"Hashtags":["#lockdowndiaries","#museocamera","#photography"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598106713,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 16:31:53 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"sketched_with_love_","CaptionText":"One more for you all from my pencil sketch album😍✨\n\nCredits - @googleimages\n\n#ganesha #pencils #pencilsketch #pencildrawing #pencilsketches #sketchbook #sketching #sketchbookdrawing #sketchoftheday #sketch #pencilartwork #pencilart #artistsoninstagram #art #artwork #artworks #drawing #drawings #passionforart #loveforart #pencildrawings #pencil_art #shades #pencilshading #pencilshade #ganeshchaturthi #lockdowndiaries #love #pencillovers #loveforpencils","NumberOfLikes":57,"Hashtags":["#ganesha","#pencils","#pencilsketch","#pencildrawing","#pencilsketches","#sketchbook","#sketching","#sketchbookdrawing","#sketchoftheday","#sketch","#pencilartwork","#pencilart","#artistsoninstagram","#art","#artwork","#artworks","#drawing","#drawings","#passionforart","#loveforart","#pencildrawings","#pencil_art","#shades","#pencilshading","#pencilshade","#ganeshchaturthi","#lockdowndiaries","#love","#pencillovers","#loveforpencils"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1598106446,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 16:27:26 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"non_saneme","CaptionText":"I have a nephew 🧡🧡\nAnd I know, I look like my mom 😆\n#atya #nephewlove #myboy #pillu #chotamodak #metforthefirsttime #lockdowndiaries #cutiepatootie #ganpatibappamorya #ganeshchaturthi #2020festival #sareelove #instatoday #niqib","NumberOfLikes":79,"Hashtags":["#atya","#nephewlove","#myboy","#pillu","#chotamodak","#metforthefirsttime","#lockdowndiaries","#cutiepatootie","#ganpatibappamorya","#ganeshchaturthi","#2020festival","#sareelove","#instatoday","#niqib"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Non_sane on August 22, 2020.

Everyone can't travel to Mumbai or Maharashtra for Ganpati Darshan during the festive season and Ganesh's arrival. I created my page for such people to meet all the idols of the Lord and attend Aartis online. I am also working as a mediator to connect people to various pandals who then take back their favorite Ganesh idol home. \n\n We live to stream the festival from different locations. We are a team of 30 and we segregate and work to capture the essence of the festival perfectly.  It is sometimes hard to travel from one place to another with our camera equipment, as Mumbai has a history of extreme waterlogging during this time. The crowd at times is a barrier for us while handling the camera or making the video.\n\n Nevertheless, there is a very different kind of energy, and that gives us the power to overcome all the problems. \nGanesh Utsav is the best time of the year for me as I travel to different Murtikars to see the making of Ganesh Ji.  It is lovely to see them intricately working on the details of the idols. The air is vivacious, and people are high-spirited with all the Dhol and Tashas to welcome the Lord, and I think that is the best part.  As I visit a lot of pandals for my page and I cover the celebration online everywhere, I get a perk of a chance to connect and chat with the Mandal and do darshan without having to stand in the queues. \n\nIn this lockdown times, the festival might not be celebrated on a large scale as we have lesser team members, and even lesser idols are being created. \nKeeping all the precautionary measures in mind, we hope to welcome Ganesha with the same warmth and love as we do every year.\n@ganpati_maza_official_ \n.\n.\n.\n.\n#ganeshchaturthi #stories #teamstoriyaan #festivalsofIndia #festivevibes #love #celebration #culture #warmth #storiyaan #storiyaanthings #storiyaanlc #ganpatibappamorya #festivalstories #livestream #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":407,"Hashtags":["#Repost","#ganeshchaturthi","#stories","#teamstoriyaan","#festivalsofIndia","#festivevibes","#love","#celebration","#culture","#warmth","#storiyaan","#storiyaanthings","#storiyaanlc","#ganpatibappamorya","#festivalstories","#livestream","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598105159,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 16:05:59 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"mememsale_","CaptionText":"Today has been a productive and kinda expensive day..

From trying to experience as many cultures as possible to looking inwards, remembering forgotten projects and reviving them. \nHaving understood the value of homegrown organic produce a couple of years ago, I was keen to get a little patch going, except for the problem of who would look after it when we traveled. \nBut then came the lockdown -- giving me all the time in the world, and nowhere to go as far as one could see. \nSo I started planting. \nThis little tree, part of a larger \"kitchen garden\" that has miraculously survived despite me, is giving us the most fragrant organic limes I have ever experienced. \nNature showed us her very best; everything that was sowed, took root and thrived without a single chemical being applied. Salads, tomatoes, radish greens, guavas, herbs, mirchis, even a couple of tiny but determined baingan plants valiantly pushing through.... I'm honestly struck by how easy it's been, and how very very rewarding! We now not only have little bits and bobs that make their way into our plates, but also a tiny green patch in the concrete jungle of Gurgaon, for when nerves need calming and minds need centering. #gratitude\n\nOh, and thank you @divaliciousdoc\nFor tagging me #newnormal \n\nHere's hoping to see more perspectives on the New Normal and what it has brought with it:  Tagging @sonataparashar @roytellstales @firepowernaik\n@rilanty\n@shredmatic\n@winter_wanderer\n@shrenikavlani @deeptidhoot \n\n.\n.\n#organicfarming #eatorganic #farmtotable #lockdowndiaries #enjoythelittlethings #deliciousfeeling #makethemostofit","NumberOfLikes":64,"Hashtags":["#gratitude","#newnormal","#organicfarming","#eatorganic","#farmtotable","#lockdowndiaries","#enjoythelittlethings","#deliciousfeeling","#makethemostofit"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Insiyah Vahanvaty on August 22, 2020.

It made our dinner time so much fun, showing photos to 👦🏼👦🏼👧🏼 and virtually checking up the school. It is not for right now, but it gives all of us a sense of next chapter to come.

This lockdown has gotten the best and the worst out of me.\n\nOn one hand, it has taught me the importance of keeping oneself busy, indulging in new hobbies, and the importance of friendships. At the same time, it has multiple times made me feel caged, suffocated, brought out the worst anxieties in me, and something I'd never ever experienced before - anger\/rage attacks. \n\nI find myself losing control of myself at the smallest of things, feel such a strong bout of anger that I just want to throw things and scream at the top of my voice. Usually happens in interactions with my closest people. And I often end up pushing them away by this behaviour. \n\nI'm often told that I'm overreacting, that this is my strategy to shut them up, or a way to blackmail them to get things done my way. And that angers me even more.\n\nI've always been a short tempered, impatient and impulsive person, but I didn't know that it could come out in ways like these. It also leads to feelings of guilt and shame for lashing out on people that I love the most and making them go through hell. But I don't know how to help it.\n\nI'm trying though. I'm taking baby steps. Like taking deep breaths as soon as I see my temper rising, meditating, and exercising. It isn't easy but I'll get there.\n\nI'm putting this out here solely because I'm sure many of you are facing similar situations, where people around you are unable to understand what you're going through. This is to tell you that it's okay if people don't get you. It doesn't matter. What matters is for you to realise and accept that there is something that you need to do to break the cycle, and change those unhealthy behaviours.\n\nIt's not going to be easy. And it's not going to happen overnight. But it'll happen. The only person who needs to have faith in you is YOU. And all you gotta do is take baby steps, and you'll get there. \n\nWhenever I feel caged, I go to my terrace, put on some Frank Sinatra tunes, and enjoy the sunset. I see numerous birds flying around in the sky like they have no worries. And sometimes, I wish I was one. \n\nWhat do you do when you feel suffocated?

Our Friday series aims to motivate fellow runners and fitness enthusiasts by spreading stories of people who continue to stay motivated through the lockdown.\n\nHere is how Coach Shivangi Sarda ( @fitness.trail ) turned the limitations of the lockdown to her advantage.\n\n\"Covid-19 was sudden & it came with a lot of uncertainty.\nIt's not easy to stay motivated & disciplined with no specific goal\/ events to look forward to. I took this as an opportunity to work on my strength & experience different forms of fitness.I have a fixed plan when I am training for events,but this time gave me a chance to try new ways to improve my fitness. I used my time for indoor rides, strength training , military fit training, mobility work & started practicing yoga which has helped me become stronger. Before the lockdown, I was facing some knee pain so I worked on strengthening & rehab.\nNow I am back to outdoor running & rides and I continue to follow my routine from lockdown which includes strength & yoga sessions.\n\nThere were days when it was challenging to get myself to workout but then I thought to myself that this is a good time to work on my overall fitness & it's going to help me when things are back to normal :) \" - @fitness.trail \n.\nHave a similar story that you want to share?

Many of us have felt a lot of pressure to make the most of the time, to do the things we have never had time to do. I know very few people who were truly happy with what they achieved during lockdown. Now it\u2019s easing, the guilt & blame for not writing the book, redecorating the house, knitting a combine harvester, is huge. Society puts so much pressure on us to achieve, & to keep raising the bar, it can feel so overwhelming & make us feel at the bottom of the heap.\n\nLockdown was unlike anything any of us had ever experienced, everything was different, unknown, scary & very limiting in so many ways. Personally, just getting through it was achievement enough, managing to have some semblance of normal life was a major achievement. Now we are faced with an easing, but also a constant change of rules & doing things. Many people are feeling a bit stuck, not really able to get going, feel motivated & are struggling to focus.\n\nWe really should be allowed to take into account how much harder it is to do normal everyday tasks. Meeting up with friends... a minefield! Are we supposed to? Are we being irresponsible? Are bubbles still a thing, how do I manage that? Am I going to get told off, fined a ton of money, catch the virus? It wasn\u2019t like this before, now we have a lot of things to navigate.\n\nWe should start by letting ourselves off the hook a little, & celebrate getting any task done, if we do manage to do something productive, congratulate ourselves & make it as big as we can.\n\nIf we can allow it to be the case, that it\u2019s much harder now doing anything out there, maybe we can shorten our to do lists a bit & do a little dance every time we change the bed or send an email.\n\nI\u2019m doing a little dance as soon as I\u2019ve finished writing this. Having set out twice to go to the shops & have to come back because I forgot my face mask, things take longer & are more frustrating.
