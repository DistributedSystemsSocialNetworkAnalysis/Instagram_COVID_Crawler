To call it a \u201Cwriter\u2019s block\u201D would be reductive; it is existential crisis, as we know it. In that sense, the lockdown has been a blessing, allowing me to express myself in a different way (for what is art if not a form of expression?). It has also served as a steady reminder, that I am more than the words I speak\/write. And so, despite well-meaning and sardonic comments alike on how I\u2019ve been \u201Ccooking a lot these days,\u201D I keep going on, simply because it is another conduit for the imaginings and imaginations within me. Using leftover crispy smashed potatoes from last night\u2019s dinner as the base for a quick papeta par edu-like dish for lunch, kind of gives me the same joy I would derive from restructuring a sentence to make more sense, or express better the things I am trying to say.

Now restrictions have been lifted, the pre-recorded weekly Zoom interviews are designed to provide insight into how our community of survivors are managing in the pandemic as a whole. A clip of each already posted to the DS channels is also posted to our feed to briefly introduce our wonderful Instagram audience and to give everyone a taster of personal affiliation with each survivor!\n\nLockdown interview number fourteen features stroke survivors Sheelagh and Andrew. Sheelagh is our Administrator at Different Strokes. She had her stroke in 2018 at the age of 51. Andrew had 3 haemorrhagic strokes in 2000 aged just 21. He takes us back to the start and through the progress he\u2019s made learning to walk and talk again, along with his aspirations and a heartwarming story how his goal was to get on one knee to propose to his now wife. He talks about the different types of brain injury he saw in rehab; the activities, treatments and physio he endured in his time there and the problems that have evolved because of his strokes - such as visual issues, epilepsy which is now controlled, fatigue and a permanent loss of feeling and movement in his arm. He discusses his struggles with Aphasia, reading and writing, how that affected his self assurance and relationships, and he explains about how casual talk with people was the best therapy. \n\nAndrew works in a school at lunchtime and continued this with key worker\u2019s kids during lockdown. He chats about juggling both work and the hard task of helping his own children with schoolwork from home and how his family teamed up to help. They both speak about holidays during a pandemic and the volatility of current times. He also mentions how he\u2019s started to mingle back into socially distanced life. \n\n Catch the full interview at:\n🔗 https:\/\/differentstrokes.co.uk\/stroke-survivor-experiences-during-lockdown\/\n▶️ https:\/\/youtu.be\/nNBMW414umk\n👍🏼 https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/differentstrokescharity\/","NumberOfLikes":18,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597834748,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 19 12:59:08 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Imitation is the best form of flattery!\n\n@naveen.polishetty would agree!\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n@pranitharaj \n@anwar18_ali\n@harshajella \n\n#unheardlyrics#misheardlyrics#teluguhumour#telugutiktok#hyderabadi#tollywood#badsinging#spoof#lockdowndiaries#justforfun#daysofourlives#artistsupport#madeuplyricsarebetter#bollywoodsinging#funnylyrics#improv#jasrajmanga#viralvideos#trending#comedyvideos#nuff","NumberOfLikes":54,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":12,"Timestamp":1597834734,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 19 12:58:54 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Golden Sky Over the shadow of the Clouds.\nGives Hope to Watchers and Dreamers feel Proud,\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nFollow and Support  @syed_mohammad1998\n.\n.\n.\n. \n#photography #kashmirvalley #Kashmirdiaries #photooftheday  #thoughtful #photographer #dusk #yellow #clouds #silhouette #morning #landscape #home #kashmiryouth #trees #art #creative #innerpeace #breeze #summerinkashmir #lockdowndiaries  #eleutheromaniac","NumberOfLikes":83,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by 𝔼𝕝𝔼𝕦𝕥𝕙𝕖𝕣𝕠𝕄𝕒𝕟𝕚𝕒𝕔  🕊️ on August 19, 2020 tagging @worldphotographersclub, @syeda_sakeena_qazmi, @syzeehy, @35awards, @i_am_jahanzaib_shah, @kashphotoclub, @_mirrahilaa, @mirareiba._, @getgosocial.app, @areejological, and @spillanddil.

Those little moments of mom and son bonding are endearing to look back upon.\n\n🧸The way he cuddles on my tummy. This is almost a daily routine where he demands to cuddle my tummy when he falls asleep. \n\n🧸The way he tells off @ricksterzzz when he troubles me. He very stubbornly believes that he is the only person who gets to tickle or trouble his Mamma 😆\n\n🧸The way he seeks for my reassurance when somebody promises something. I have always strived to give him the truth. I find that it develops a very strong trust bond.\n\n🧸The way that he loves Bollywood songs and will definitely whip out those thumkas just like his mamma does 😅😆\n\n🧸The way that he is so good at sulking, just like his Mamma😄. Not proud, but it is what it is.\n\n🧸The way he reminds me of empathy by pointing out that I maybe doing the same things that I termed wrong.\n\nDo share some of the precious moments that you have shared with your little one? These are trying times, let's fall back on those memories that bring joy.\n\n#grizzlyezra #grizzlybear #growingtoofast #littlenothings #lifewiththebear #boymom #boymomlife #mommyhoodunplugged #momsofinstagram #momlife #mommicroblogger #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":256,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":18,"Timestamp":1597782054,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 18 22:20:54 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Optical illusion but make it fashion!\n\nNothing like some strategically placed pleats to hide 5 courses.

It was made with foggy specs in mind.  It seams the smaller the specs the foggier they become when wearing a mask. Come the cooler weather it will be worse.  This is a prototype. I'll make once more with a better shaped chin dart, a  nose wire, and an adjustment to the elastics placement. \n\nThe hat is made from 2 throw-out shirts. Denim & lightweight cotton check. It is a pattern hack to keep the elastic invisible inside the lining. I have done this by means of \"bagging out\" and slipstitching the rear lining seam closed.  I always forget to include my label as I make, so it's added afterwards forming a sort of loop so the hat can be attached to a belt loop, or a bag strap by means of a crab (caribiner climbing clip) when the sun's gone in or the rain has stopped etc.\n\nI can return with the pattern name & number and\/or a crab pic if anybody is interested.\n\n(@morrissews, this loop's for you)\n\n#hat\n#handmadeisbetter\n#lovehandmade\n#makersofinstagram\n#madebyhand\n#makersmovement\n#makersgonnamake\n#instasewing\n#sewist\n#sewing\n#sewingprojects\n\n#repurpose\n#upcycled \n#recycled \n\n#lockdowndiaries\n#isolationsewing\n#coronovirus\n#outbreak \n#covid19\n\n#seeyouontheotherside","NumberOfLikes":10,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1597743283,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 18 11:34:43 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Showing Faith on Corona Warriors\n___________________________________\n© Sanjay Joshi 2020\n___________________________________\nDevice used - Canon 1300d\nLens - 18-55mm\n __________________________________\n#AvTvISO_WPD2020 @avtviso #stayhomestaysafe😷 #coronawarriors  #police #indian #respect #photoscapeofthemonth #lockdowndiaries #streetphotos #streetview #peopleinframe #authenticity_is","NumberOfLikes":176,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by sanjay joshi (AFIP, FGNG) in Jodhpur with @avtviso, and @depositphotos_contest.

I used to wonder why is she in pieces? She had a bigger purpose, but I failed to understand then. \nI remember once, I was in trouble for something that didn\u2019t let me sleep for nights. She would just sit with me, and say I\u2019ll pray trust me it\u2019ll be okay. \n\u2022\nShe read my diaries once (she shouldn\u2019t have, but she had to) while i waited to be ridiculed, she came and said, \u201Cbeta, you can always tell me what\u2019s bothering you, I\u2019m here for you always.\u201D in the most politest tone & hugged me.

But, for the last seven years, since she was house-bound,  we would go to her place every Navroze for lunch (she preferred to keep her dinners light) with Parsi Bhonu catered to, from various Parsi Caterers. The table would have this spread of Marghi na Farcha or Salli Marghi, Patra ni Macchi, Mutton Pulao-Daar, Rotlis, Lagan nu Achaar and for dessert, Lagan nu Custard. And before that, some Kawab \/ Cutless with the beer. And there would always be so much leftover, and we would have it for days after, and would end up skipping dinner that evening. \nThis year, since we didn\u2019t have to rush to her place with food, we decided to cook at home, as a small tribute to my mom, and, decided not to go overboard. So, for Navroze lunch there was an absolutely divine Bharuchi Kid Ghosh with a fragrant Kaju Kismis Pulao. The missus had nailed the flavours. 💯😋The mother would have approved for sure 😊.\nFor dessert it was roses, roses all the way... made Gulab Cup Cakes for the first time. With a genuine Gulcand centre and a Rose Water-Gulcand buttercream frosting. We loved it.

Sheelagh is our Administrator at Different Strokes. She had her stroke in 2018 at the age of 51. Niki had her stroke in October 2016 aged 52. She tells us about her atypical symptoms, her time in hospital and the home support, stimulation & exercise she received for the 6 weeks after. Niki talks about her anxieties, mental health problems and emotions, and tackles the taboo of how post stroke care focuses more on the physical and not enough psychological. She stresses the importance of seeking help and support and how it\u2019s essential to getting back on our feet. She also chats about family history, genetics and diabetes and how she combats these through diet and stress management. Niki talks about coming to terms with and working through accepting and acknowledging the new her. They both discuss the \u2018brick wall\u2019 caused by fatigue, how frustrating it can be and learning points on how to manage it.\n\nNiki has worked from home but like many of us has struggled with isolation. Unknowingly Niki contracted Covid-19 in March and only recently realised what felt like the flu was, in fact, the virus. She highlights the further barriers and complications for disabled people, including her Mum who has many at risk health conditions and is in a care home that has had outbreaks.\n\n Catch the full interview at:\n🔗 https:\/\/differentstrokes.co.uk\/stroke-survivor-experiences-during-lockdown\/\n▶️ https:\/\/youtu.be\/nNBMW414umk\n👍🏼 https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/differentstrokescharity\/","NumberOfLikes":13,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1597658744,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 12:05:44 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":76,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by piku on August 17, 2020.

Here are 5 accessories that can make your ensemble look complete and effortless. #nomoreconfidential \n.\n.\n.\n1. A watch adds an elegant and classy  look to your outfit. \n2. A delicate necklace highlights your neck and pulls together your plain outfit, making it look chic. \n3. An ear cuff will add high doses of charm and grace to your look. It's a great alternative if you aren't into hoop earrings.\n4. A clutch is as practical as it is beautiful. Add a bright clutch to your neutral ensemble to make it pop. \n5. Break the monotony of an outfit with the help of a belt.

Of Mom's chicken curry, which is mainly cooked using the most rudimentary spices. Due to the given circumstances, it has become difficult to get hold of the different spices and herbs, that you would require, to come up with a fancy dish. And thus, we used lemon leaves here, for garnishing, which not only adds a bit of colour to the dish, but also enhances its aroma. So here's a picture of local chicken, cooked in a simple gravy, using onions, garlic, ginger, tomatoes, and lastly, a blend of various spices(cardamom, cinnamon, dried red chilli, bay leaves). \n\n#chicken#chickensofinstagram #chickencurry #chickenlover #kitchenchronicles #cleaneating #chefmodeon #lockdown2020 #lockdowndiaries #chickenrecipes #buzzfeedfood #dailyfoodfeed #instayum #instagood #instaeats #foodbloggers #foodstagram #foodventures #foodiesofinstagram #foodgasm #foodaddict #foodphotography #foodforthought #foodtherapy #nomnomnom #happytummy #goodeats","NumberOfLikes":54,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @__thecarbdashians__ on August 17, 2020.

It\u2019s that desire to be someone or to do something. It moves you like nothing else in life. It\u2019s something you\u2019re attracted to, something you\u2019re passionate about and it fills you with joy and sets your heart on fire when you do it.\n\nTravelling fills me with joy and ignites my passion for living to the fullest on this planet. When I am not travelling I am always researching, browsing and planning to travel. It\u2019s always on my mind and in my spirit. \n\nIstanbul is one city I have visited a couple of times and yet there is so much left to see and explore. Love the mix of classic royal ottoman culture, modern day Europeanised influences, Islamic art, the delicious Turkish cuisine and the grand charming palaces on the steps of Bosphorus river. I simply cannot wait to travel to Turkey 🇹🇷 again. \n\nOnce the world finally gets a handle on this deadly pandemic I will forever be grateful for a chance to travel again in peace. \n\n#travel #travelgram #instatravel #tourism #passportready #wanderlust #besties #forever #ilovetravel #passionpassport #suitcasetravels #traveldeeper #iamatraveller #discoveries #forbestravelguide #passion #travelislife #travelispassion #ciragan #palace #kempinski #istanbul #turkey #ottoman #empire #lockdowndiaries #postlockdowngoals #travelgoals #memories #travelmemories","NumberOfLikes":50,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by wanderlustbestiesforever🦋 in Ciragan Palace Kempinski Istanbul.

Calling different sexual orientation unnatural just because of so called societal norms is totally bullshit. Society terms everything unnatural and abnormal that violets their so called stereotypical norms. Its important to learn and educate yourself and accept everyone the way they are. Our earth, its resources, its healing and feeding capabilities, are all apart of the pride movement's overarching goal for peace, love, and equality. For humans and the planet earth alike.

Even \"Money Heist\" is still on its list of new releases.\n\nSo I ended up watching \"Scent of a Woman\" again. I was reminded why I liked Al Pacino, whose sadness as Col. Frank Slade was a masterpiece, earning him an Oscar nod. Chris O' Donnel, too, as Charlie Simms, whose integrity of character as a poor boy on aid in a rich boys' high school was a showcase of melancholy.\n\nOf course, this scene stands out in my memory, with the lovely Gabrielle Anwar and \"Por Una Cabeza\" in the tango scene.\n\nWhat to watch next?

But it happenned. Started with it on an 'Eh' note but it has touched some of the deepest strings within me andhas made its own special place in my life. Here it goes-\n\nBeginning with Sheldon, you hated changes as much as I do but did not even remember or miss the past when you got busy with the changed life. You've my heart. You were selfish at times but that does not change my feelings for you. ❤️❤️\n\nPenny, you're a friend that everyone should have in their lives. You not just accepted them wholeheartedly but also taught Leonard and Sheldon the true meaning of love. Different forms of love. You taught me that it's okay for people around you to be selfish, you should keep loving them with all your heart. And what you said about changes- I love you, girl. ❤️❤️\n\nLeonard, you were confused & indecisive about everything but you were sure about the most important things in your life. And that matters the most. I found you very close. Just can't express why & how. 😘😘\n\nHoward- Good to find you who joked on anything and everything and even in the worst case situations. Ask me? People find us weird but we're just cool people. They can never understand us. 🤩 ❤️\n\nBernie: Loving someone weird is not easy. But you anyway decided to be with Howard & turned out a step ahead of him in terms of one liners. I shouldn't say this but you're the kind of dominance I seek in life. Almost always right or forcefully right. 😂\n\nAmy, you knew what you had in store for yourself when you decided to be with him. You showed compassion and bravery and patience and tolerance and friendship and yes, your last speech changed it all for good so, thoughtful and mending. You were the star. 🌸🌸❤️❤️\n\nAnd last Raj, it's okay to run after just one thing and still not find it. You proved that sometimes, we got to stop running after things we are not able to accomplish and cherish what we have with us. Maybe human connections and happiness and the feeling of laughing with those you love is above everything else. 🌸❤️\n\n#Recommend #lockdownkasahara #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":75,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":10,"Timestamp":1597498343,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 15:32:23 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"FREEDOM...must be achieved! ❤️🇮🇳\n\n#indipendenceday #15thaugust \n#freedomisntfree #art #freedomofspeech #friendsinperson #lockdownstories #lockdowndiaries #mumbaimonsoon #mumbairain #somewheremagazine #myeverydaycapture #photooftheday #photography #photographer_of_india \n#mumbai #india  #creativmistakes21","NumberOfLikes":48,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Palak 🏹❤ on August 15, 2020.

There was no beautiful alone time that heals your mind and body, and provides you with serene revitalisation.But during lockdown, we had ample amounts of time to enjoy doing absolutely nothing. Going up on the terrace, letting the slow moisture-laiden breeze tangle up your hair, and leaving all your worries behind was perhaps my best experience.I practised mindfulness and self-introspection in this unexpected and bizarre me time. It helped me to nurture my inner-self and slowly come out of the existential crisis that young adults normally suffer from.Listening to music after a long time was rejuvenating. Talented American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift just released her album \"Folklore\", and my favorite pass time now is just vibing to the relatable lyrics and enthralling symphonies. Kahlil Gibran had said -'Music is the language of the spirit. It opens the secret of life bringing peace, abolishing strife.' \"\n\n#edtimestories #music #soulful #introspection #lockdowndiaries #taylorswift #kahlilgibran #mindfulness #wholesome","NumberOfLikes":19,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by ED Times on August 15, 2020 tagging @paridhi.sehgal.

Time is really flying.\nSometimes we need change, but then when this change is not available, or difficult, we need to create it step by step, not force it into existence. We need to change our perspective, and look at things from different corners, from all the corners.\n \nThese days of the lockdown has blinded me and cleared my vision at the same time. For one thing, I got enough time to think about all the things I wanted and the things I didn't want, reflect upon myself and my objectives, what I need to do, and I don't need to do. However my reflections and my process of thoughts were so hightened, my days got blurred, and I got lost into a pattern that almost me numbed. Many things happened, and I failed to sew their significance or their meaning.\n\nOnly now I see that I'm able to look back at all this time that has gone by, and at all the things that I have done and the things that I didn't do, and it makes me feel truly satisfied and happy, because despite the blur, the mess, and the emotional numbness, I know that I'm moving forward, not backwards, I know that I'm advancing.\n\nI know that this is not the case just with me, many people maybe feeling that way, or have felt this way.\n\nHow was the lockdown for you? Has it effected you positively, negatively, or both?\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n..... #lockdownart #lockdowndiaries #lockdownthoughts #lockdownfeelings #lockdowngoals #lockdownactivity #lockdownactivities #lockdownwriting #lockdownwritingchallenge #lockdownwritings #fictonwriter #fictonwriting #writingfiction #writingmotivation #writingmotivationalwords #authorlife #authorgram #authorcommunity #authoress #authortube #newauthors #newauthoralert #newauthorswanted #newauthorsofinstagram #newauthoritythinking","NumberOfLikes":115,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Writing Fiction, Reading Books on August 14, 2020.

I love films that are about folks testing themselves, following a dream, doing something that peels away the layers of \u2018the self\u2019 you think you know.\nThis quote resonated with me deeply and really got me thinking.\n\n\u2019How important is it in life not necessarily to be strong but to feel strong, to measure yourself at least once, to find yourself at least once in the most ancient of human conditions, facing the blind, deaf stone alone, with nothing to help you but your own hands and your own head....\u2019\n\nWhen I first heard these words I immediately thought of birth. How by just looking at me at certain points in my labour you may have thought I was weakening, that I was losing my will or ability to birth my baby.  What you wouldn\u2019t have seen (and sometimes it was also lost to myself) was the deep, embedded connection and trust I held in birth and in my intuition.  So although my strength and trust was felt deep in my bones, it was not always shown outwardly or felt consciously by me ...and that was ok... because it lead me to face a challenge that would take no prisoners!! There was no way through it other than through it, no way but to trust that deep knowing that birth belongs to women, that unless my intuition told me something was deeply wrong, I was the only one that could see me through, with my \u2018own hands and my own head\u2019! \nIt reminded me of this awesome quote by Yolande Norris-Clarke of @freebirthsociety \u2018Birth will decimate you, and that\u2019s one of its gifts\u2019!\nThe gift being the knowledge that you are stronger than you have the capacity to understand. \n\nThe quote from \u2018Into The Wild\u2019 obviously wasn\u2019t written about birth as it was written by a man! I would imagine that for him it was about adversity and coming through it via expression and release and trust and determination.\nThese are very testing times we are living through at the moment and sometimes I don\u2019t feel strong at all.  But I keep putting one foot in front of the other as that\u2019s all we can do.  So please know, even if you aren\u2019t feeling strong, YOU ARE, because you are still here.

I have been writing and rewriting the review since then. I couldn't find the right words to express how much I loved this book. I still can't. But not posting about this book seems unfair. \n\nThis is the story of a black man charged with the rape of a white girl. This is the story of the best dad - Atticus Finch. This is the story of three little gems - Scout, Jem and Dill.\n\nWhat I liked best is that the story is narrated through the innocent eyes of a little girl called Scout. It shows us that a 9-year-old kid can understand that judging a person by his colour is not fair. However, adults find it very hard to treat people in a fair manner. At times they don't even realise what they are doing is wrong. \n\nThis book was written in 1960, but it has still not lost its relevance. The recent murder of George Floyd reminds us that we haven't learnt much despite addressing the issue for several decades. \n\nI bought this book a few years back. I couldn't get past the first few pages all those years. But, this time I finished it and I am so glad I did. \nIt is my recent favourite. 😍\n\nHappy reading❤️❤️❤️\n\n(Can anybody guess my current read based on the book cover you see in the picture?.)\n\n#writerscommunity #writers_den_ #atticusfinch #harperlee #bookstagram #booklover #blacklivesmatter #racism #prejudice #loveofwords #tokillamockingbird #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":36,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Unnimaya cm on August 14, 2020.","NumberOfComments":11,"Timestamp":1597419035,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 14 17:30:35 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#lockdowndiaries #happymemorialday #withlove❤️ ⅞","NumberOfLikes":35,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by 🚭 ↕️sAK ®️eDDy 🚭 on August 14, 2020.

Why are we always crawling over the finish line when it comes to a holiday? We all need to get better at giving ourselves a rest. Practice is the only way.\n\nWe are off down to Norfolk, which I booked when lockdown first started easing and now I can't quite believe it's actually happening. \n\nWe've managed the last few months in a house with barely any outside space and at last we will have a garden for five glorious nights. Looks like it's going to chuck it down, but I'm fully prepared to drink wine on a patio in a thunderstorm.\n\nI've finished working with four of my six Mighty Messaging 1:1 clients now and it has been such an incredible treat, I have no words. I always feel a bit sheepish sharing feedback, but I'm going to have to do it this time, seeing as I've been telling everyone else to, and also because it has made me beam (will pop a few bits in Stories).\n\nI'm going to open the programme up again in September at a slightly higher price, but if you want to reserve a spot early you can book this month for the old price and grab a bargain, just DM me for more info. The programme is 3 weeks long and is designed to get you moving with your online presence and messaging (web, social, emails, blogs) in a more focused way. If you're looking to get back out there with your business in September, it could be just the boost you need ⚡\n\nI'm also elbow-deep in planning my next workshop, which is going to be all about understanding and writing for your audience in an intuitive way. Move over ideal customer exercises (Jenny aged 43 drinks earl grey and shops at Waitrose) this is going to go really deep into customer values, beliefs and behaviours until they become walking, talking, real beings you can write for with ease.\n\nSo excited about this one - I'll be back with more info after the break! Jump!\n\nHave a great week next week everyone, I'll be bombarding you with holiday spam in Stories no doubt ☂️🌩🍦❤","NumberOfLikes":65,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Penny Brazier ~ copywriter on August 14, 2020.

However when you look closely, you\u2019ll be able to sense the emotions people must have associated with these seemingly random streets. These were the streets where the children of the old couple down the road used to play and the streets where the famous police officer found the love of her life on a rainyday. Places dont simply remain as walls, pillars and roofs. Maybe that\u2019s why we find it difficult to leave our hometowns, not because of the housing or the living amenities there but because we\u2019re afraid to leave behind the prospect of making future memories in those places with the people we love. Concrete, glass and wood grow into fond memories of times that have passed. When the children of that old couple visit their parents and that police officer comes back, all theyre going to be able to see is how much things change. They\u2019ll see old versions of themselves, clinging to the places and things they knew, afraid of change, and then, they\u2019ll resonate with the fact that change is inevitable. They\u2019ll walk back down those streets, with smiles on their faces, maybe even tears of reminiscence, seeing life for what it is, a strive for growth. Every place holds great meaning for someone or the other. Do those roads seem random to you anymore?\n\n- @_harjas._ \n\nGraphic By: @onuj_z.jpg \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n#graphicdesigning #graphicarts #graphicinspired  #inpiracionpoetica\n#prolificpoet #yanko #designforgood #designinspiration #aestheticdesign #designisinthedetails #designiseverywhere #designislife #designboom #proactiveprocrastinators  #designforgood #designerlifestyle #todaysthoughts  #nostalgiacore \n#selfcontemplation\n #beproductive #productivityhabits \n#quarantinedays #beproductive #doitnow #procrastinating\n#lockdowndiaries #lockdownart\n #wegotyou #dreamhigh #teenartist #teenwriters","NumberOfLikes":157,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Proactive Procrastinators on August 14, 2020 tagging @onuj_z.jpg, and @_harjas._.","NumberOfComments":40,"Timestamp":1597395375,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 14 10:56:15 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Insatiable. \n\n#lockdowndiaries \n#mensfashion \n#quarantinelife","NumberOfLikes":0,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Mayank Sharma on August 14, 2020.

From the person who used to stay out 14hrs a day on average to the person who haven\u2019t even seen the roads for a month or two straight, not even to get groceries was an interesting turn of events. But I must say I am loving this now. I see a number of people putting out posts on social media about how they hate staying at home and not being able to meet their loved ones, and all fidgety to go back to that NORMAL life we had. I miss my other family consisting two people; girls with whom at least meeting every other fortnight was as necessity as breathing but it\u2019s been almost half a year that I have seen their faces and nothing feels miserable compared to that. I am a barista who hasn\u2019t had a sip of coffee since I volunteered to be on unpaid leave. And what is a barista without coffee eh? I was in a relationship where I felt drained even if it was just for few number of months and I ended up calling it off. I was so afraid to talk about it that deep inside I wished him to vanish rather than confrontation. Because I am never the bearer of bad news but the receiver. I was always at the other end of spectrum. I have cut off ties with people to whom my absence doesn\u2019t mean anything. I have limited my arena to such extent where now I only communicate with people who cares about my wellbeing. Was it that easy? Oh hell no! There were times where I was just gone  because nothing I said to them made me feel understood. I like to steer the wheel of my life hence, I distanced myself from people I love so that I can reach to my own conclusions. My friends always disliked that part of me, but they understood me too. At one point, finally this pandemic crawled under my skin and made me go insane. \n\n#tobecontinued #journaling #writing #writersofinstagram #booklover #tumblr #explore #pandemic #lockdowndiaries #novice #writerslife #thoughtsbecomethings","NumberOfLikes":2,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @abstractionofhermind._ on August 13, 2020.

It's a chilly day in Melbourne and although I do have to 'mask up' and face the world (have items to post to family and a number of books that my readers have asked for). Steve is an essential worker so is still able to move around due to his job but being a writer, I am confined to our postcode, and I don't mind if it means we protect the vulnerable in our communities. I just miss seeing those we love face to face  I plan to spend most of the day by the fire and researching for my current book, Seven Windows (see previous post). Whatever you do today, stay warm and safe and take care of yourself. Practicing self care at this time is SO important. You can't pour from an empty vessel 💞💝💞\n\n#isolation #love #coronavirus #infinity #marriage #victoria #relationships #twinflame #soulmates #ajourneytofindingyournewnormal #thegoldenglowchronicles #novels #booklove #booksofinstagram #bookworms #bookgiveaway #bookporn #reviews #instaread #readingisfundamental #amreading #historicalfictionseries #outlander #bestfriendsforever #lockdowndiaries #selfisolation #winterishere #homeoffice #wearefamily #togetherforever","NumberOfLikes":27,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Billy Tea and Bookish Dreams on August 13, 2020.
