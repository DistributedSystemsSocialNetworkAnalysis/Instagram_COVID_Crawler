Popular in herbal culture from Charlemagne, who ordered his people to grow it, to the Pharisees, 2,000 years of Japanese menthol harvesters, to the Romans who brought it with them as they marched through Europe and into Britain.\n\nToday I discovered, most excitingly, that it has an origin story in Greek Mythology (and we all know I love a Greek Myth üåù). Two stories; the first is that the nymph Minthe was being chatted up by Hades, much to the jealousy of his queen Sephony who turned the nymph into a plant, Mint. The second, that unlucky in love Minthe, was beloved by Pluto, who turned her into a scented herb after his jealous wife took umbrage. Poor gal! \n\nBut she\u2019s now a wonder herb, and menthol has become probably the most ubiquitously used herbal derivative we have in modern times, from toothpastes to chewing gum, \u2018Minty Fresh\u2019 has come to mean clean and healthy. But I feel like that marketing ignores so many fundamental properties that Mint has; a fierce antiseptic, calmative, anti-spasmodic, anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, anti-parasitic, a stimulant. It works to soothe nervous headaches, increases concentration and is known to relieve gastro-intestinal disorders.\n\nSo an all rounder really, I\u2019ll post some options on @_thegreenplace soon! \n\n#mintplant #thegreenplace #lockdowndiaries #londongardens #herbalremedies #brockley","NumberOfLikes":34,"Hashtags":["#mintplant","#thegreenplace","#lockdowndiaries","#londongardens","#herbalremedies","#brockley"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ‚ú®ldc üåô‚ú® in Brockley with @lauradrakec, and @_thegreenplace.

I have thought about this scene several times since. Grafton street is usually bursting with atmosphere, with musicians, singers, artists, tourists, shoppers and the general hustle and bustle of a capital city. All of them gone now. The ladies that sell the flowers üíê have also departed. Usually at the top of Grafton street there is a queue of carriage horses waiting to transport tourists around the city, there was only one carriage. Shops have closed, and won\u2019t be reopening.\nI didn\u2019t know whether to post this or not and I had to think about it. I started my insta page as I wanted to post up beat images of simple things in life that get me through and make me happy and also maybe things that I had neglected to appreciate pre corona. I do think that it is important that people remember that ones\u2019 insta page may not be a true representation of the \u2018owner\u2019, it is only a segment of their lives. My aim was to create a page that appreciates the small things and helps me forget about the devastation the corona virus has caused. There are times when I think of how drastically life has changed and life pre corona... One thing I really miss is the soothing embrace of a good auld ü§ó hug (nothing beats that), the craic that was to be had in the pubs and going to a gig and dancing or standing in the audience squeezed in a sea of people.

After years of living with Fibromyalgia, which is living with pain and fatigue, I had a realisation - for three years I've worked to \u2019get rid of the pain\u2019. When I sat with the pain, I only focused on the hate, blame and judgement and all the things it took away from me. I never welcomed it, I never listened to it and I never respected it.\n.\nCOVID has forced me into new realms of solitude and reflection, as it has for many of us. And through Dreamwork, working with a Cognitive Psychologist and an amazing Pranic Healer (@valentina_healing) - I started accepting,  listening and finally loving my pain, fatigue and Fibromyalgia. \n.\nNot judging negative emotions and making them \u2018bad\u2019 has really helped me as a tactic to frame COVID. \n.\nMy question for you: Have you made COVID or any emotions you maybe feeling \u2018bad, wrong, judged it or saw it or yourself as less than imperfectly perfect?\u2019\n.\nAre you willing to sit with whatever you maybe feeling or COVID as an experience and let go of the judgment or blame and see it through neutral eyes to listen to what message and gift it brings to you? \n.\nJust a thought - looking forward to hearing you\u2019re reflections on emotions üíï\n\n#mindfulness #meditation #mindfulnessmeditation #mindfulnesspractice #meditationpractice #meditations #meditationchallenge #wellbeing #wellbeingwarrior #wellbeingjourney #wellnesscoach #makingthebestofit #lockdown #lockdown2020 #lockdownlife #lockdowndiaries #lightworker #loveyourself #creativity #creative #quotestoliveby #creativewriting #Creativelifehappylife #creativityeveryday #creativitycoach #creativitymatters","NumberOfLikes":28,"Hashtags":["#2,","#mindfulness","#meditation","#mindfulnessmeditation","#mindfulnesspractice","#meditationpractice","#meditations","#meditationchallenge","#wellbeing","#wellbeingwarrior","#wellbeingjourney","#wellnesscoach","#makingthebestofit","#lockdown","#lockdown2020","#lockdownlife","#lockdowndiaries","#lightworker","#loveyourself","#creativity","#creative","#quotestoliveby","#creativewriting","#Creativelifehappylife","#creativityeveryday","#creativitycoach","#creativitymatters"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Creative Coach in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia with @valentina_healing.

My idea of photography is to capture the specific moment to go back to them and relive it. Of course, as I share these images as my artwork, there is no way for the viewers to realize the essence of the moment that was for me. Therefore, I find myself often coupling my photographs with poetry or meaningful quotes. I feel this adds another layer to the images and give an opportunity to the viewer to be transported to their own moments of enrapture. My art demands not merely the skill of photography, but also the awareness of myself and the moments that would be worthy to be captured.\n\nSince the COVID-19 lockdown, stuck in my house, I have failed to come up with moments that hold my attention and emotions. The landscape has always brought out the best in me. I have felt alive in the magnanimity of nature at once. The awareness of my insignificance has inculcated humility in me. Being stuck at home now is not the best feeling. My avenue of expression has been hampered significantly. Even though I did not think of myself as an artist clicking these pictures, these have been the medium of my expression all this while. Currently, it is definitely a struggle to go through the rut of my regular office work and house chores, without having an out-let through such pictures.\n\n@anujkuriachan  is a 28-year-old IT professional who wants to capture nature\u2019s magnanimity through his photography. He is also an aspiring poet. He has his roots in Kerala but was born and raised in Delhi and has lived in Bangalore, Bhilai, and Kolkata. He shares his images of the clouds from pre-lockdown days. During the lockdown, captured from his terrace, the images translates into his wish for an escape.\nIf you or your artist-friends have a story to share, connect with us.\n.\n.\n.\n#ArtistsLockedIn\n#ArtistsoftheWorld #artistsupportartists #ArtistsofDelhi\n#artistsinquarantine #artistsinpandemic #artistsinlockdown #ArtistsDiary #artistsfromunderground #ArtistsinFocus #Lockdowndiaries #photography  #photosofinstagram #himalayas #cloudsofinstagram #cloudscape","NumberOfLikes":24,"Hashtags":["#ArtistsLockedIn","#ArtistsoftheWorld","#artistsupportartists","#ArtistsofDelhi","#artistsinquarantine","#artistsinpandemic","#artistsinlockdown","#ArtistsDiary","#artistsfromunderground","#ArtistsinFocus","#Lockdowndiaries","#photography","#photosofinstagram","#himalayas","#cloudsofinstagram","#cloudscape"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1597231863,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 12 13:31:03 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"thinnerstrongerhappier","CaptionText":"This blog is \u2018 Exercise Edges and COVID-safe holidays\u2019 \nBeing back at the gym means getting back to a supply of feelgood hormones on tap.

Daisy went on to become a sexual assault advocate but sadly took her life last week. \n\nI\u2019m so sick of this still being a problem in our society and men refusing to take responsibility for their actions.  Yes!! ALL MEN!!!\n\nI remember being a little girl talking to my friends about what to do if we ever get raped. Even at the age of 12, probably younger, we knew the likelihood of one of us being raped. I was walking around the park the other day and tears started to fall down my cheeks thinking of the tactics we came up with. Tell him you have aids so he won\u2019t carry on. Piss or shit yourself so he will be disgusted and stop. Just be silent and still so he won\u2019t hurt you and it will be over faster. And the most heart breaking, pretend you\u2019re enjoying it and he will stop because wants to see you in pain and uncomfortable.

The hope of seeing better and brighter days. And now when i see life getting back to normal in Pakistan, i'm having mixed emotions. Am happy yet little scared of this virus. I really dont wish to see it bouncing back again. On the contrary, am glad we can go to parks, malls, spas and restaurants, ofcourse with our safety gears but i'm so happy atleast we can. \n-\nIts been 5 good months since the country is in lock down. Our economy has crashed brutally. People have been laid off. Many people went under severe depression, mental health has been screwed up, people have died out of depression, suicide rate has doubled up, small startups and restaurants closed down. i'll be not wrong here if i say we have seen worst of all times in these past 5 months. We never thought of experiencing a pandemic in out life, did we? But we are living in it damn it!Imagine what we have been through!! But now Alhumdulilah ya rab we have survived. The curve has started to flatten. Business and hubs are resuming, public transports are resuming, narkets and shops are opening. I  just hope and pray our economy recovers really soon. \n-\nLet's just hope nobody chokes again. No more losing of loved ones. Let's hope & pray we transition back to normal world real soon.

We were supposed to be having a romantic dinner but instead I started picking up on him about some silly thing. I was irritable and definitely in a snappy mood. After listening to me being a brat for about 5 mins, he looked at me, grabbed me by the waist & told me, \u201Chey, enough grumpy ass\u201D while lifting me up in the air...I got angrier & tried to free myself but it was too late: he was dropping me fully clothed into the bath that we had prepared with candles and all.\u2063\n\u2063\nThere was nothing else to say. I was laughing my head off while he was getting fully clothed as well inside the tub. I tried to apologise for being so grumpy but instead we had one of the most explosive make out sessions in history.\u2063\n\u2063\nAfter a few days I realised what has happened that day: under my snappy mood what was underneath was this story I had made up of my lover not fully appreciating the romantic dinner I had prepared and him not finding me beautiful.\u2063\nI wanted more words of affirmation and more devotion. I wanted appreciation, lust and love thrown at me. But instead of asking for that, I \u201Ctested\u201D him: I got grumpy with this primal feminine -not very healthy- trait of \u201Cwill you still love me if I do this?, will you actually stay if you see all parts of me?\u201D\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\nSo, 1st lesson: my partner making an unexpected, polarising action (as being in his solid masculine who doesn\u2019t put up with my shit & takes control of the situation with a loving + playful approach) works way better than trying to talk things through, especially when I\u2019m not making any sense.\u2063\n\u2063\n2nd lesson: when grumpy with my partner, I must check in with myself to see what\u2019s the desire. As Esther Perel says: \u201Cunder every complain lies an unmet need\u201D. Asking for what you need and communicating it effectively is the key for building a healthy relationship. Because the passive-aggressive \u201Cyou gotta guess how I want to be loved\u201D hasn\u2019t worked for anyone in history\n\u2063\nQuestions to ask ourselves: How can you own more what you want? How can you better communicate your desires? How can you invite your partner to stand strongly on his solid masculine energy?üñ§","NumberOfLikes":521,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Self Love & Relationship Coach in Bali, Indonesia.

How empowering it is, the comfort of knowing that the relationship will sustain itself through missed calls and prolonged silences and the busy-ness that life brings.

Social distancing in full force, we are back to wondering if life will ever truly get back to normal, we refrain from saying it out loud, but we fear at times it won't and we are all a bit tired of this and we are all dreaming of being somewhere else, at times. we look at each other through a screen and we wave, hello. Are you there? Can you hear me? Connection is not good enough. It's never good enough when you need to talk. And so we are waiting.

All variable, voluminous, and velocitous data have nothing to offer, unless you have the question you want them to answer. It's common sense, but they put it so poetically.\n\nPlus, there are historical anecdotes too like did you know that today, there is enough information in the world to give every person alive 320 times more than what historians believe to be stored in the Library of Alexandria in Egypt, which in the third century BC was believed to house the sum of human knowledge, the largest collection of recorded information in the ancient world?\n\nI have no compulsion to be a data scientist, but if it's interesting enough to propel me to the very end of this course and to the many other specializations under this program, who knows? So far so good.\n\nWhat is the mathematical expression for wishful thinking?\n\nI am awake enough to go into Week 2, but I have also just started reading \"The Tattooist of Auschwitz\" by Heather Morris and O x M x G = unputdownable!\n\n#nevertoolate\n#datascience\n#coursera\n#quarantinejournal\n#lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":13,"Hashtags":["#nevertoolate","#datascience","#coursera","#quarantinejournal","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by AA Patawaran in Manila, Philippines.

Forex is definitely associated with a scam\/cash-loss label, however if you truly understand the markets, practice discipline and follow a tight risk management plan it is a legitimate way to earn extra money. The course is AMAZING, I\u2019ll do a proper review soon. What I love about forex is its flexibility - there are sooooo many different trading styles. When I head back to placement in a few weeks I\u2019ll be focusing on long-term trades which won\u2019t require daily effort. Please note, this is not a get rich quick affair! After completing the course I\u2019ve spent 3 months on a DEMO account, perfecting my strategies and discipline (emotional trading is a real thing üò≠).

Self adhesive wall hooks create storage for a hat and a jewellery pouch holds Whoopsy's new wardrobe.\n\n#thethingswedoforourkids  where we dont have #maileg \n #storytime #becomesreality \n#makingdowithwhatwehave #jugaad #craftfromwaste #reusereducerecycle #ecofriendlytoys \n#beatrixpotter #peterrabbit #favoritechildrensbook  #imaginaryworld #whereanimalstalk \n\n#lockdowndiaries #keepcreating #quietjoys","NumberOfLikes":19,"Hashtags":["#thethingswedoforourkids","#maileg","#storytime","#becomesreality","#makingdowithwhatwehave","#jugaad","#craftfromwaste","#reusereducerecycle","#ecofriendlytoys","#beatrixpotter","#peterrabbit","#favoritechildrensbook","#imaginaryworld","#whereanimalstalk","#lockdowndiaries","#keepcreating","#quietjoys"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1596956634,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 09 09:03:54 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"sultan_zelda","CaptionText":"Choc Top #bullachoctops #boysenberrychoctop #sundays eating #icecream in #lockdown2020 #lockdowndiaries Loving the #choctopicecream #flavours #icecreamsundays #eatyouricecream Choc Top Time #choctoptime","NumberOfLikes":27,"Hashtags":["#bullachoctops","#boysenberrychoctop","#sundays","#icecream","#lockdown2020","#lockdowndiaries","#choctopicecream","#flavours","#icecreamsundays","#eatyouricecream","#choctoptime"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @sultan_zelda on August 09, 2020.

This is a bootleg kits though so my fingers got hurt in the process; a lot of fitting issues, some parts aren't molded properly, and of course the color of the plastic is a little darker than the original Kotobukiya and shinier. I'll probably start working on the panel lines once my fingers are no longer aching and then I'll do some touch up paints for the missing color details. The color separation is good though, the off white and black really blends well with the dark green and light green as well as the grey for the Panzer CAS. Classes will be starting next week so I'll probably start slowing down my pace and go back to my usual one-day-one-part build pacing. And I should really do something about my sleeping pattern.
