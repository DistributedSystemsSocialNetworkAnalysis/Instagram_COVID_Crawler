For somebody like me who was lucky enough to have never set foot in a hospital before; the amount of indescribable pain, the epidural not working four times, the near-emergency c-section that wasn\u2019t were all quite mentally damaging. This stuff caused flashbacks for months during my already sleep deprived nights.\n\/\/\/\nWe did however come home, counted our blessings and got on with the frenzied care of a newborn with the help of my parents who shopped, cooked, sterilised, did laundry for two weeks straight. We went on two date nights to satisfy my sushi craving and his Hawksmoor craving, and we even hosted a little Happy First Week party for Leo where he got to meet some of his family and friends.\n\/\/\/\nLittle did we know that party was the last chance anybody would get to hold him in their arms. We had a feeling something worse was down the line with corona and we started to self isolate before the lockdown.\n\/\/\/\nIt\u2019s now been officially 5.5 months of zero help from anybody. Not a single minute of babysitting. We\u2019ve watched friends and family in awe and disappointment as they bent the rules in their own little ways. We care so much for his little life we\u2019re protecting that we started to politely decline certain interactions unless it\u2019s on our terms \u2013 which is the gov guidelines or even stricter rules.\n\/\/\/\nTo say the least, it\u2019s been lonely. Equally, they say what doesn\u2019t kill you makes you stronger and I truly now feel that I smashed the first almost six months of motherhood all on my own including saving Leo from a bottle aversion (and obviously with Ross\u2019s unwavering help and support!). \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#coronavirus #coronababy #coronamom #lockdownlife #lockdowndiaries #covid19 #covidphotodiaries #myfamily #newmom #newmomlife #whatdoesntkillyoumakesyoustronger #motherhood #motherslove #motherson #çekirdekailem #justthetwoofus #parenting #parenthood #parenthoodunplugged #ailem #lamiafamiglia #lockdownbaby #quarantinelife #karantinagünlükleri #annelik","NumberOfLikes":116,"Hashtags":["#coronavirus","#coronababy","#coronamom","#lockdownlife","#lockdowndiaries","#covid19","#covidphotodiaries","#myfamily","#newmom","#newmomlife","#whatdoesntkillyoumakesyoustronger","#motherhood","#motherslove","#motherson","#çekirdekailem","#justthetwoofus","#parenting","#parenthood","#parenthoodunplugged","#ailem","#lamiafamiglia","#lockdownbaby","#quarantinelife","#karantinagünlükleri","#annelik"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by cuppateawithmilk in Sale, Cheshire.

The materials speak to to endurance, and geological history - the marble is a product of eons of pressure and is a product of slow time, a provocative idea when we live in such a charged and impermanent moment. My vision for the Locarno table came from my many walks observing materials along the coastal beaches of British Columbia.

Building a niche can be a highly valuable start up point, to which you can expand with time. \n\n▫️Purpose: Please consider creating and delivering content rich in substance so you can influence your followers in a meaningful way. This platform can actually give you great visibility and opportunities through sharing anything and everything you\u2019re passionate about. Whether that\u2019s your story, your business, or any other particular interest- There is a market for every single person out there, it\u2019s all down to your commitment and individuality. Plus the feedback youll get will be a lot more substantial and valuable than mere emojis and likes for likes 💌\n\n▫️Engage: please refrain from believing in the insane idea that you shouldn\u2019t follow too many people back, or thinking you\u2019ll lose any value by responding to people\u2019s comments or private messages.

However they have their own problems. After all we are social animals so the quarantine and social distancing is giving rise to mental health concerns such as anxiety, anger, sleep disturbances,  depression and PTSD. \nAdditionally they are grappling with infection, boredom, frustration, inadequate food and financial losses. Medicos are focussing on physical health but we need to consider our mental health as well\nSo how do we put a stop to all this A few basic steps:-\n1) STOP judging those who have travelled abroad. They are already stressed. \n2) Keep yourself well hydrated and take a diet rich in protein. \n3) Exercise daily💪💪💪. There is no better stress buster. Downtown and use some online fitness apps. \n4) Limit your intake of caffeine and alcohol. \n5) Focus on the positives.

This is a painting using poster colours I made the other day for practice sake and also to finalise what I'm going to eventually paint onto a canvas that my bae gifted me. So it's gotta be good! \n.\nHonestly, this is really not good. The lack of experience clearly shows and even though I'm okay with the colours used. The way it's been used and the ratios between them is bad. The tree in particular is just all over the place.\n.\nI'm happy with the sunset sky and the water and reflection. Of course there is tons of room for improvement. But the overall look of the background is working for me. Probably because I've done that sort of thing before. But I really have a long way to go as far as paintings go. \n.\nSo...Why did I put up an artwork I didn't like?\n.\nBecause I want to remember where I was so I know how far I've come when I look back on it in a while. Talent is nothing more than perseverance + consistency x time. It's math, not magic. I'm not calling myself talented or hard working.

After distributing the gifts, she asked, 'Mummy! When can we do this again?' Ever since, we celebrate festivals at the orphanage\u2013you can\u2019t put a price to their smiles. \nSo one day, during the lockdown, I saw a sweeper limping, yet doing his duty. I immediately gave him food, a mask & a sanitizer. His eyes lit up & he said, 'Thank you!' They were just 2 words, but I felt his gratitude & realised how little our essential workers have. \nSo I ordered sanitization kits & collaborated with a kitchen service to distribute them amongst essential workers, police & sweepers. My husband was worried about my safety, but I followed protocol. \nA week later, my son Shrey said, 'Ma, wait! I'm coming with you\u2019, & Meghna joined too. We went from Juhu to Marine Drive, distributing essentials amongst 400 workers.\nWe've been doing this for 2 months every weekend & the response has been heartwarming. A cop even asked Meghna for a selfie to show his kid! We even give free health check-ups to the elderly in our society. \nIt began last month, when my father-in-law had a low sugar episode. That\u2019s when Meghna said, 'Shouldn't we do something for the senior citizens too?' She\u2019s a doctor, so she attends to the elderly, while I arrange for their food & medicines. They live alone & they're scared\u2013we\u2019re just trying to make them feel less alone. \nLike one of the aunties had breast pain & feared it was cancer, until my daughter did a physical examination & calmed her down. \nBut that day when Meghna came home, I couldn\u2019t help but hug her. I'm so proud of the woman she's become. And Shrey too\u2013he's just 14, but he used all his birthday funds to buy essentials for 150 workers.\nWhen I began trying to make a difference 15 years ago, I barely had the resources. But now, with our NGO Meghashrey, we can do much more. \nI\u2019ve realised that if you really want to help, it takes one step. I started with funding my driver\u2019s son\u2019s education\u2013today he\u2019s a CA looking after his family. So that\u2019s what it\u2019s about\u2013taking that one step to help & you never know how that one step could change a person\u2019s life forever.\u201D","NumberOfLikes":35331,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":142,"Timestamp":1596630205,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 05 14:23:25 CEST 2020","Location":"Mumbai, Maharashtra"},{"Owner":"nidhisdhariwal","CaptionText":"#parenting#children#fun#motherhood#peacefulparenting#mindfulparenting#naturalparenting#respectfulparenting#parentinglife#motherhoodsimplified#littlehumans#documentyourdays#fan#lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":27,"Hashtags":["#parentin","#childre","#fu","#motherhoo","#peacefulparentin","#mindfulparentin","#naturalparentin","#respectfulparentin","#parentinglif","#motherhoodsimplifie","#littlehuman","#documentyourday","#fa","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Meraki Institution on August 05, 2020 tagging @howtoraiseakid, @deepakchhapolia, @my_ayurvedic_life, @amitabhbachchan, @sharaddhariwal, @dr_swatimutha, @abha_bhanshali_shah, and @mommynetwork.

The pre-recorded interviews take place via Zoom and are posted every Tuesday afternoon. You can find them all on the Different Strokes website, Facebook page and YouTube channel but a snippet of each already on the DS channels have also been posted to our feed to briefly introduce our wonderful Instagram audience and to give everyone a taster of personal affiliation with each survivor.\n\nLockdown interview number nine features stroke survivors Genise and Bridie. Genise is our Family Support Officer at Different Strokes. She had her stroke 21 years ago at the age of 34. Bridie is our Instagram volunteer and also did a successful takeover in January which she discusses in the interview. She had a thalamic stroke 10 years ago, aged 17. Bridie spoke to Genise about the issues she faces having left sided numbness and damage, along with her chronic pain condition, how lockdown has aggravated it, how it\u2019s delayed appointments with her neurologist to keep monitoring and managing the pain with medications and how difficult it is not seeing him face to face. She talks about digesting the current news, missing her friends, the difficulties she will now face with the demand for work from home jobs, unravelling her creation and imagination during this period, celebrating a birthday during lockdown and how she\u2019s looking forward to getting back into normal routine where the days stop mingling into one. She also chats about her aims going forward on the DS Instagram, how our befriending services would\u2019ve been invaluable to her at the time of her stroke and how she hopes this year will open the eyes of abled people having a greater understanding whilst keeping up accessibilities and meeting the needs of those in need.\n\nCatch the full interview at:\u2063\n🔗 https:\/\/differentstrokes.co.uk\/stroke-survivor-experiences-during-lockdown\/\u2063\n▶️ https:\/\/youtu.be\/nNBMW414umk\u2063\n👍🏼 https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/differentstrokescharity\/\u2063","NumberOfLikes":23,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1596623938,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 05 12:38:58 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"mahimavarmabestmehendiarts","CaptionText":"#lockdownbride #lockdownindia #lockdownmakeup #lockdowndiaries #lockdownbrides #lockdownbride2020 #lockdown2020 #lockdownlife #lockdownmehendi #lockdownmehndi #lockdownhenna #lockdownart #lockdownshaadi #lockdownshaadi2020 #lockdownshaadi😀😀 #lockdownmakeover #lockdownmakeuplook #bestmehendiartsbyvijayavarma #mehendibyvijayavarma #mehendibymahimavarma #bestmehendiartsbyvijayavarma","NumberOfLikes":12,"Hashtags":["#lockdownbride","#lockdownindia","#lockdownmakeup","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdownbrides","#lockdownbride2020","#lockdown2020","#lockdownlife","#lockdownmehendi","#lockdownmehndi","#lockdownhenna","#lockdownart","#lockdownshaadi","#lockdownshaadi2020","#lockdownshaadi😀😀","#lockdownmakeover","#lockdownmakeuplook","#bestmehendiartsbyvijayavarma","#mehendibyvijayavarma","#mehendibymahimavarma","#bestmehendiartsbyvijayavarma"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Best Mehendi Mahima Varma on August 05, 2020 tagging @nikita_k_87, @chetnashendge, @pallavivaidya_official, and @marathi_sahitya_sanjivani.

Give me sexy Orion over Gove the goblin any day. Plus, magic thrives in uncertain times (hello Dark Ages!)\n\nAnd there is something about being stuck in your own environment for months on end that shifts your focus to nature, the seasons, the stars. Makes you shriek when you spot a sunflower finally budding in the yard, see a goldfinch springing through the park with a breadcrumb in its beak, watch the clematis on the fence in the back alley growing at least three inches a day.\n\nThere's something about the sight of a long-haired cat the colour of demerara sugar curled up on a brick wall in the sun surrounded by gently waving pink cyclamen that makes me want to, I dunno, PAINT it. And I don't think I've painted more than a skirting board since I was 12.\n\nThings feel different. My senses are looking for different things.\n\nI've become obsessed with things that smell nice, fancy shower gels, expensive perfume samples, a child's freshly washed hair, line-dried sheets, the damp mulch of a forest, sun and salt on warm skin.\n\nI want to talk to the people I've loved my whole life, I want to make sure they're ok.\n\nFunny things matter. Important things matter? Life admin drops further down the back of the sofa. But life is lived and fully felt. Joy, wonder, grief, despair.\n\nAnyway, I've got some space this month, for the first time in a while. I write websites, blogs, articles, newsletters. I enjoy putting words into an order that makes the reader feel seen and heard. So if you're looking to outsource your words, drop me a DM and I'll weave you some magic 🌠💖","NumberOfLikes":57,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Penny Brazier ~ copywriter on August 04, 2020.","NumberOfComments":31,"Timestamp":1596562665,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 04 19:37:45 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"shokii_m","CaptionText":"hyped. \n\n_______________________________________________\n#smallbusinessowner #poet #businesswoman #southafricanwomen #futuredoctor #lockdowndiaries #loungewear #smalltitties #confident #sunflowerletter","NumberOfLikes":172,"Hashtags":["#smallbusinessowner","#poet","#businesswoman","#southafricanwomen","#futuredoctor","#lockdowndiaries","#loungewear","#smalltitties","#confident","#sunflowerletter"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by reshoketswe maropola in Home :).

The BIG issue is how humanity has treated our natural world. \nHumanity, over the millennia, has (as a species) drifted so far from what truly is important. We\u2019ve become so caught up in this age of instant gratification that we\u2019ve forgotten our way and severed the connection we had with the natural world. Zoonotic diseases are a THING! And there are very good reasons for them being a THING! \n\nWhat I find myself wrestling with is this thinking that humans are superior to the natural world. That we have \u201Cdominion\u201D over animals and that therefore gives us this false sense of entitlement in which we abuse nature to no end and without thought of consequence. Many people who view themselves as \u201Creligious\u201D and \u201Cup standing\u201D will (expectedly) take offense at my statement, BUT, that won\u2019t stop me! \nIn discussions lately, the one phrase which crops up the most in this regard has been \u201CThe Bible says ... we have dominion over animals THEREFORE it is our right to do as we please with them.\u201D \nI\u2019m sorry BUT, that isn\u2019t good enough for me! Just because a book has something written BY HUMANS, does not mean it is a free card to exploit, abuse and savagely kill animals. \nAnimals show more empathy, devotion and pure love than us!\nWhat in the heck has happened to us loving nature? Conserving it? Why all this savage blood lust??? \nThis pandemic has shown us how the natural world fights back ... that nature doesn\u2019t need (OR WANT) us! \nWE NEED NATURE! We are dependent on nature for OUR survival! We only have OURSELVES to blame! \nThe BIG QUESTION though, is: ARE WE WILLING TO MAKE CHANGES IN OUR LIVES IN WHICH WE LEARN TO BE BETTER? TO DO BETTER? TO BE BETTER? \nOr are we simply too far gone? #lockdowndiaries #conservewhatyoulove #saveournaturalworld #weareourownworstenemy #weneedtochange","NumberOfLikes":7,"Hashtags":["#hluhluwegamereserve","#lockdowndiaries","#conservewhatyoulove","#saveournaturalworld","#weareourownworstenemy","#weneedtochange"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1596554262,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 04 17:17:42 CEST 2020","Location":"Eshowe, KwaZulu-Natal"},{"Owner":"shivaniiigoyalll","CaptionText":"I need some drop!! 🕊️\n\n#dance #dancer #indiandancer #bollyshake #mood #hiphop #urban #groove #funky #style #sharp #musicality #bollywood #ballet #jazz #jazzfunk #funky #fun #feelit #hitit #lockdowndiaries #terrace #dancefloor #keepdancing #dancerlife #dancersofinstagram #hm #skechers","NumberOfLikes":102,"Hashtags":["#dance","#dancer","#indiandancer","#bollyshake","#mood","#hiphop","#urban","#groove","#funky","#style","#sharp","#musicality","#bollywood","#ballet","#jazz","#jazzfunk","#funky","#fun","#feelit","#hitit","#lockdowndiaries","#terrace","#dancefloor","#keepdancing","#dancerlife","#dancersofinstagram","#hm","#skechers"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":6,"Timestamp":1596553911,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 04 17:11:51 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"vanellouie","CaptionText":"Netflix picks: Some shows I\u2019ve watched with @vanlouissam over the past few months with character storylines that was enjoyable to watch.\n\n1. Snowpiercer - After watching the movie adaptation by Korean director Bong Joon-Ho, was quite eager to see how it would be translated into an entire season\u2019s worth of events and it did not disappoint. Tackles issues of class warfare in a post-apocalyptic world all revolving inside a train 1,001 cars long. Superb performance by Jennifer Connelly. Also, Hamilton fans will enjoy seeing Daveed Diggs play a serious role.\n\n2. Hollywood - Portrays stories of ambition sprinkled with social issues from an amazingly diverse character base. Also a period drama, think MadMen but Old Hollywood.\n\n3. Politician - Steps into the world of high-school career politicians turned actual politicians and all the mind games that go along with the journey. Like Designated Survivor or House of Cards but for teens or young adults.\n\n4. The Umbrella Academy - Pure entertainment and brilliant soundtrack choices, hands down. Some characters storylines are annoying tbh but the crowd-favourites are worth all the screen time they get. S2 is out so go watch.\n\n5. Warrior Nun - Heard good reviews, gave it a shot, and finished it in 2 days. Basically, nuns in a convent but trained like superheroes. Dabbles a bit into Catholic institutions as its backdrop and #girlpower\n\n6. Never Have I Ever - Ultimate teen TV show, produced by Mindy Kaling. Very light and comedic, don\u2019t expect a deep storyline. But you do get to walk with a third culture kid struggle through high-school as she tries to overcome the loss of her dad.\n\n#netflixpicks #quarantinelife #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":64,"Hashtags":["#girlpower","#netflixpicks","#quarantinelife","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":17,"Timestamp":1596553698,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 04 17:08:18 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"sweetaarshi_2007","CaptionText":"because every picture tells a story....❤ \n(PS :- Swipe to see the overlay used)\nEdited with @picsart\n.\n.\n.\n#selfpotraitideas #selfpicture #picsartedit #selfportrait #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":50,"Hashtags":["#selfpotraitideas","#selfpicture","#picsartedit","#selfportrait","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":12,"Timestamp":1596553855,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 04 17:10:55 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"adarshdecor","CaptionText":"Every event needs exceptionally curated decor elements that turns it into a gorgeous reality!\nThis rustic floral styling is at our Client's intimate wedding at their Farmhouse for the celebration of their love♥️\n\n#wedding #functionalart #weddingdecorations #weddingdecor #decoration #decor #decohome #lockdowndiaries #intimatewedding #weddingday #homedecor #bloom #bloomingflowers #bloomingdales #flowerbackdrops #blooming #bloomgloom #flowersofinstagram #flowermagic #flowery #weddingwire #weddingflorals #weddingfables #weddingplz #weddingsetup #flowers🌸","NumberOfLikes":13,"Hashtags":["#wedding","#functionalart","#weddingdecorations","#weddingdecor","#decoration","#decor","#decohome","#lockdowndiaries","#intimatewedding","#weddingday","#homedecor","#bloom","#bloomingflowers","#bloomingdales","#flowerbackdrops","#blooming","#bloomgloom","#flowersofinstagram","#flowermagic","#flowery","#weddingwire","#weddingflorals","#weddingfables","#weddingplz","#weddingsetup","#flowers🌸"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Adarsh Decorators in Ludhiana, Punjab, India.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1596552823,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 04 16:53:43 CEST 2020","Location":"Ludhiana, Punjab, India"},{"Owner":"adarshdecor","CaptionText":"Every event needs exceptionally curated decor elements that turns it into a gorgeous reality!\nThis rustic floral styling is at our Client's intimate wedding at their Farmhouse for the celebration of their love♥️\n\n#wedding #functionalart #weddingdecorations #weddingdecor #decoration #decor #decohome #lockdowndiaries #intimatewedding #weddingday #homedecor #bloom #bloomingflowers #bloomingdales #flowerbackdrops #blooming #bloomgloom #flowersofinstagram #flowermagic #flowery #weddingwire #weddingflorals #weddingfables #weddingplz #weddingsetup #flowers🌸","NumberOfLikes":16,"Hashtags":["#wedding","#functionalart","#weddingdecorations","#weddingdecor","#decoration","#decor","#decohome","#lockdowndiaries","#intimatewedding","#weddingday","#homedecor","#bloom","#bloomingflowers","#bloomingdales","#flowerbackdrops","#blooming","#bloomgloom","#flowersofinstagram","#flowermagic","#flowery","#weddingwire","#weddingflorals","#weddingfables","#weddingplz","#weddingsetup","#flowers🌸"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Adarsh Decorators in Ludhiana, Punjab, India.

My phone was stolen and I was taken to the ground. The Cape Town police are a bit intense. And I think they saw me as a silly tourist - as a bit of a joke.\u201D\nAfter this inauspicious start, Asad, who works in digital marketing, spent ten days visiting sites such as Cape Point and checking out the city\u2019s vegan restaurants. Then lockdown kicked in.\n\u201CIt was super strict. They arrested people for breaking the rules. You were only allowed out to go to the supermarket.\u201D\nHoled up in the Glen Boutique Hotel & Spa in Sea Point, Asad worked from his room. In his spare time he made friends with other visitors in the same position. He also got to know the staff.\n\u201CThe owner is amazing and the staff became like family,\u201D he said. \u201CI was upgraded for free to the penthouse and they gave us all free food too.\u201D\nIn spite of the generosity of the hotel, Asad is still paying for his extended trip in instalments. And he had to fork out for an expensive repatriation flight. He was relieved to return to Stratford, where he lives, but says that he now plans to take his laptop and travel around the UK whenever he gets the chance. He had only visited Brighton once before, but it was number one on his list. \n\u201CBrighton is an amazing place.

I\u2019m pretty happy with how it\u2019s looking but the last two items I want to get to finish it off are a cabinet for under the sink and a big piece of art for the wall above the bath. Any recommendations where I can find reasonably priced art?","NumberOfLikes":14,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Michaela R on August 04, 2020 tagging @mrp_home.

Was previously using a tiny, made-in-Delhi one which arrived with 2 out of 4 knobs detached and multiple screws loose. Nevertheless, it served me well and was well worth the \u20B92K I spent on it (plus the \u20B95 Fevi-kwik for it to not fall apart).\n\nBut this new one is a beast. Settled on it after visiting virtually every store in Bangalore, trying different ones over and over again, watching countless YouTube review videos and comparisons, stalking eCommerce sites and feeling disappointed on being told how stocks reach India often years after the actual release date.\n\nAfter bugging Furtados for weeks, they finally got 1 unit from Mumbai just for me. \n\nWhat followed was the bigger challenge of finding an auto that night from Koramangala to HSR Layout. With the store closing, it starting to rain and with no cabs seemingly available, my pocket was relieved of another 350\/- by the great Bangalore auto anna experience. \n\nFurther adventures followed, like me dropping *freaking* moisturizer through the grill, over the tube of the preamp, within a week. What luck, I mean, maybe I would use moisturizer once a year? and for it to drip in the exact few centimetres where it shouldn't. \n\nGreat amp though. Been 4 months away already. Looking forward to practicing on it again whenever I do return back to Bangalore or maybe vacate my flat and get everything shipped to Bhilai?

To priorities & maintain the breath, it should be slow and subtle.\nAlways prioritise the inner work over the outer work, thus the ego & asana.\n\nWhen the breath is in control the immune system is enhanced. It purifies and increases blood circulation, improves organ function, balances autonomic nervous system, promotes deep sleep, concentration, calmness and healthy digestion.\n\nEnergy known as breath flows through our body via the nadis and to our chakras. Pranayama helps us clear these pathways.\n\nFor breath is life, and if you breathe well you will live long on earth - (Sanskrit proverb)\n\u2014-\n\nIda arises in the left side of the body representing the moon, in contrast Pingala begins on the right side of the body symbolising the sun.\nThe superior sushumna nadi runs through the central channel of the spinal cord representing consciousness. \nThe nadi is only active for certain short periods of time, when all three Nadis unite. \n\nIt creates a flow of spiritual energy, this flows during meditation. \nWhen inactive we are pulled down by chitta. \nControlling pranayama thus control of your body and mind.\n#pranayamabreathing #fullmoonmagic","NumberOfLikes":39,"Hashtags":["#pranayamabreathing","#fullmoonmagic"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Rosie Wright in Summer Time with @sohofarmhouse.

He spoke about toxic productivity, something many of us have struggled with but perhaps without realising it. We have seen key workers and their tireless commitment to public service. We have seen people make the most of staying at home by learning new skills, starting exercise routines or volunteering in the neighbourhood. We naturally compare ourselves to each other and if we feel like we're not being as productive as we could or should be, this can have a negative effect on our wellbeing.\n.\nLike thousands of others, Alex has been on furlough. Even though he has struggled during this time, he has found happiness knowing that he is loved by God and can be used by God. Adapting Jesus' famous Beatitudes from the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5), Alex summarises: \u201CBlessed are the furloughed for they will find fulfilment, purpose and their identity in God.\u201D Alex's testimony is available to watch now on IGTV.\n.\nIf you'd like to learn more about faith and what it means to be a Christian, send us a message.

It meant we had an established brood of hens who already got on, and we didn\u2019t have to travel to stoke the next day either!\nI\u2019m letting them settle in properly and trying not to disturb them too much just yet, but when I can, I\u2019ll take some photos of them individually and you can have a proper good look at each one!\nThank you to everyone for the naming suggestions, they were so cute! We have chosen to call them:\nMargot (after Margot Robbie)\nRuby (after Ruby Rose)\nPippa (after Joe\u2019s family dog)\nFearne (after Fearne Cotton)\nHolly (after Holly Willoughby)\n🐣🖤\nI think the older two are 7-8 weeks and the younger ones maybe 6 weeks old? They\u2019re so tiny! The seller is hopefully going to send me their birthdays over, I\u2019ve chased them again this morning 🙊\nHave a lovely week! 🥰\n#chickencoop #silkiesofinstagram #lockdowndiaries #sizzlefrizzle #chickensofinstagram","NumberOfLikes":131,"Hashtags":["#chickencoop","#silkiesofinstagram","#lockdowndiaries","#sizzlefrizzle","#chickensofinstagram"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Leanne Jones on August 03, 2020 tagging @rubyrose, @fearnecotton, @margotrobbie, @hollywilloughby, and @chickencoopsuk.

This is one of the largest and most elaborately patterned owls in the subcontinent, spread through most forested areas in the Western Ghats, Himalayan foothills and parts of northern Eastern Ghats and Central India. \nIv seen them a few times in Kanha and Thattekaad before but always wanted to see one near home, especially since their eerie call can be heard almost every night in the woods here. \n\nYesterday, the wait ended. Our neighbour informed us of a large owl on a tree with a jungle fowl kill... And this was at 9am. What followed was one of my best encounter with this titan of the night sky. It stood there, majestically with its kill, on the branch of a large Jamun tree, fending off large flocks of birds, both large and small, which kept trying to mob the owl. After every wave of bullying ended, the owl would feed a bit and start vibrating it's throat (gular fluttering) believed to help it loose excess heat. \nThis encounter lasted a good few hours and we observe all of this from a good distance, in high definition thanks to the long range birding scope ATX 95 from Swarovski. All these videos and images have been shot using my Lumix mounted to perfection on the Swarovski scope...and the quality is surprisingly flawless. \nA bit of luck and a good field kit that is quickly deployable, ensured one of the most memorable birding encounters ive had in Indian forests. \n\n#swarovskioptik #swarovski #ATX95 #lumixgh5s #lumix #Birding #birdingasia #bubo #owlsofinstagram #nightbirds #raptorsonkill #raptors #owls #owling #earlybird #nutsaboutbirds #seetheunseen #indianbirds #birder #birds #birdsofprey #birdsofinstagram #birdphotography #indianwildlifephotographer #indianwildlife #nature #backyardwildlife #lockdowndiaries @swarovskioptik_birding @andbeyondtravel @andbeyondasia","NumberOfLikes":415,"Hashtags":["#swarovskioptik","#swarovski","#ATX95","#lumixgh5s","#lumix","#Birding","#birdingasia","#bubo","#owlsofinstagram","#nightbirds","#raptorsonkill","#raptors","#owls","#owling","#earlybird","#nutsaboutbirds","#seetheunseen","#indianbirds","#birder","#birds","#birdsofprey","#birdsofinstagram","#birdphotography","#indianwildlifephotographer","#indianwildlife","#nature","#backyardwildlife","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":44,"Timestamp":1596437887,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 03 08:58:07 CEST 2020","Location":"Nilgiris, India"},{"Owner":"sapna.bakshi","CaptionText":"I love tattoo 💓💓💓\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#savage #glam #bodycon #terrace #xoxogirls #bebegirls #sapna #see #kolkata \n#poser #fitgirls #instadaily #instagood #outfitoftheday\n#quarantine #lockdowndiaries #dressup #tcgirl\n#homephotoshoot #chanel #stayhome  #share \n#hotpicture #styling e #styleblogger #blogger\n#photography #indoor #black #xoxo","NumberOfLikes":584,"Hashtags":["#savage","#glam","#bodycon","#terrace","#xoxogirls","#bebegirls","#sapna","#see","#kolkata","#poser","#fitgirls","#instadaily","#instagood","#outfitoftheday","#quarantine","#lockdowndiaries","#dressup","#tcgirl","#homephotoshoot","#chanel","#stayhome","#share","#hotpicture","#styling","#styleblogger","#blogger","#photography","#indoor","#black","#xoxo"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":36,"Timestamp":1596437761,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 03 08:56:01 CEST 2020","Location":"Kolkata - The City of Love"},{"Owner":"free_ah_iruntha_oru_like","CaptionText":"சோதிக்கிறானுக😏\n.\n.\n#epass #tngov #lockdown #lockdowndiaries #lockdownmemes #lockdownlife #lockdown2020 #TR #str #strfans #vijay #vijayfans #thalapathy #corona #coronolife #coronamemes #ajith #thalafans #vadivelu #vanitha #goundamani #funnymemes #comedymemes #comedy #whatsappstatus #tamilcomedymemes","NumberOfLikes":32,"Hashtags":["#epass","#tngov","#lockdown","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdownmemes","#lockdownlife","#lockdown2020","#TR","#str","#strfans","#vijay","#vijayfans","#thalapathy","#corona","#coronolife","#coronamemes","#ajith","#thalafans","#vadivelu","#vanitha","#goundamani","#funnymemes","#comedymemes","#comedy","#whatsappstatus","#tamilcomedymemes"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Free ah iruntha oru like 👍👍👍 on August 02, 2020.
