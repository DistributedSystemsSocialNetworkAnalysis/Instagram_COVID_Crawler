Oh man, what a time to be alive. I\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019m struggling a little. I can\u2019t help but feel profoundly grateful for a warm home, two of my favourite people, the fact that we\u2019re all healthy\u2014the list goes on\u2014but at the same time, I am struggling! Three weeks of Stage 3 lockdowns only to have the clock reset and the six week countdown starts again.\n﻿\n﻿I\u2019m thankful that our government is taking these necessary steps, especially as there are some in our society, unfortunately, who have been skirting the rules. But I think that, for as much as we should be counting our blessings, it\u2019s also OK to recognise that you\u2019re not OK. I know I will be\u2014I have wonderful family and friends, and lots of projects I\u2019m excited to start on (brace yourself @dtbrunt)\u2014but right now, I\u2019m acknowledging that this news hasn\u2019t come easy.\n﻿\n﻿It\u2019s been really, really hard to hear of family members in hospital and know that there is absolutely nothing that will allow you to see them (we\u2019ve investigated every possible option). It is hard to see friends visiting the beach, eating out, visiting their family and friends. We took that for granted earlier this year when the lockdowns were lifted slightly (and, dare I say it, we\u2019ve all been taking it for granted for a very long time) but it\u2019s all these little things that I am very much looking forward to once all this is over.\n﻿\n﻿So while I take some time to process, I know there are a lot of people who might not have a support network. What\u2019s more, every Thursday, Dan and our church members pack bags of food and other basic items for people in our community who don\u2019t even have the resources to access simple toiletries. One of the things that has helped me since this whole pandemic began is to not focus on myself. If I can be a spot of kindness or a listening ear for someone else, I realise that I really don\u2019t have it as bad as I thought.\n﻿\n﻿So as we buckle down and prepare to head into this next round of lockdowns, please know that if you are struggling, my inbox is always open, and I am more than willing to chat. I got you, we got this, and what\u2019s even better, God\u2019s got us all (Isaiah 46:4) 🤍","NumberOfLikes":35,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Maritza Brunt ✨ on August 02, 2020.

First time I ever wore a mask😷. I am not against wearing a mask and Please keep in mind that I live in The Netherlands where the covid situation was not like other countries so the restrictions were different for us. Wearing surgical mask doesn\u2019t prevent you from getting virus.! Social distancing is the most important.! It is for your own safety but I want to write about this with medicine expertise around me. But that\u2019s for another day 😊\n.\n.\nAnyways, Few weeks ago, I went to Lille, France. It\u2019s approximately 2,5 hours by car. It was our first day trip after the lockdown. We have been to Lille many times before but this time, it was different. It was too crowded. It\u2019s always busy on Saturdays but this weekend was something different.\n.\n.\nI thought France was hit bad by covid19 so people will be more cautious. I thought people will keep social distance like people in The Netherlands. I was expecting people in malls like here and people are more cautious by themselves. This was not the case in France. People were even not remaining distance in queue. So we didn\u2019t go to any store. I wanted to look for some clothes for my son but the situation was quite worse there 🙂.\n.\n.\nSo the face mask was compulsory in the stores and restaurants. We wanted to go to a restaurant but couldn\u2019t because of no masks. We were never obliged to wear a mask in The Netherlands because there was never a strict lockdown here like other countries. The masks are only compulsory in the public transport which we don\u2019t use these days.\n.\n.\nWhen the situation was worse here, we didn\u2019t go out at all, my husband went to grocery store or we got home delivery for everything we needed. But the things got better soon. I only went to my garden and that was my outing 😊 but better to be safe than sorry. Things got better here and there is still no obligation of wearing masks in stores, restaurants or malls (the situation will be changing soon though). People are careful by themselves. So back to mask, my first mask was in France and this is the picture of my first mask which we bought from a pharmacy.\n.\n.\nDo you have a mask story?

I Substituted Oregano with Rosemerry. \n  2. I only baked the salmon and did not broil after, so I used baking paper instead of aluminum foil. \n\nTips and Tricks 🧑\u200D🍳\n 1.You can cook salmon in a pan, in the oven, and on the grill. \n  2.Both frozen and fresh salmon are perfect for this recipe. I used fresh because it Is easier to find at the local grocer. \n  3.Many sides  go well with salmon including steamed vegetables, salad, roasted potatoes, creamy mushrooms and spinach, couscous, grilled esparagus, Quinoa salad, Brussels sprouts etc..\n 4.This is a 5 min preperations and 18 min cooking recipe. Delicious, healthy and quick meal on a work from home day. \n\nFun fact 🎁\nSalmon are considered \u201Canadromous\u201D which means they live in both fresh and salt water. They are born in freshwater where they spend a few months to a few years (depending on the species) before moving out to the ocean. When it\u2019s time to spawn, they head back to freshwater.  Very few other fish can survive in such wide ranges of salinity, and would die if they moved between salt and fresh water the way that salmon do.\n\n#salmon #foodie #couscois #esparagus #roastedpotatoes #salad #quinoa #foodporn #fish #bakedsalmon #omega3 #seafood #instafood #dinner #healthyfood #foodstagram #delicious #bakedwithlove #homemade #homemadewithlove #recipes  #passionforfood #cookeatrepeat #quaranteam #lockdowndiaries #eatdrinkandbemerry","NumberOfLikes":416,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":28,"Timestamp":1596367841,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 02 13:30:41 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Home made Chicken Schezwan Fried Rice with Chicken Chilli...

And yesterday was another reminder of the weird times we're living in. I think for many people the idea of not spending it with their loved ones was just too painful to skip. We caught up with family through video calls and chats but I acknowledge that it's not the same.\n\nI'm hoping that we get some normality back next year whether it's celebrating Eid, Christmas or Diwali.

I laughed even louder, and wider. And stopped caring about that gap at all (even though I was always somewhat insecure about it). I just wanted to annoy them. That\u2019s literally all. I was a kid. I wanted to show them I\u2019d laugh and creep them out and so be it. But that, in itself, just happened to become a part of me. Not the part where I wanted to annoy them to a point where they\u2019d start crying, I\u2019m not as mean now lol. But the part where I never again was ashamed of my laugh. I don\u2019t know how that works honestly, how something you learnt from other people that\u2019s not perfect, becomes your weapon. Your shield. Your strength. I guess it\u2019s mostly about taking back the power. To not allow anyone else to dictate what part of you is pretty and what isn\u2019t, even if you yourself struggle with insecurities. The feeling of empowerment, of being in control of how you feel about yourself, is way more stronger than the feeling of being assumed pretty by the world. Once you get there, there\u2019s nothing holding you back. So here I am, with the widest smile. Knowing full well that it may not be perfect, but it\u2019s mine to own. Mine to judge. And mine to love.","NumberOfLikes":116,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":36,"Timestamp":1596352621,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 02 09:17:01 CEST 2020","Location":"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia"},{"CaptionText":"Happy Sunday momshies! 🙋\u200D♀️Hands up kung miss nyo na rin magsimba at magpasyal with the whole fambam kada sunday.\n.\n.\n.\nDasal pa po tayo more momshies para mas bumalik na sa carefree days..\n.\n.\nPlease pray also for our frontliners and our positive cases, may we all come out stronger than ever 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏\n#happysunday\n#covid19Ph\n#lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":69,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by RUTH - Mommy Vlogs on August 01, 2020.

A snake having to shed its skin sorts. \nThus I\u2019m busy learning, studying, researching material for few papers I need to write in order to complete my pending Masters in Science, Religion & Philosophy (which I had to put on hold as I committed my time for @thereddoorindia work in schools). \n\nThis month\u2019s theme focuses on various divinations, the supernatural and history of cults in shaping our approach towards well-being. \n\nImage has no connection to my post but allows me to share the range of my grey & white matters.

But we have a good news. Licious are selling some of the best and tasty spreads for us and my favorite is shawarma spread. Its so yummy with tiny pieces of chicken in it.

Slowly as we were shutting ourselves from the outside world, home strated to feel like a warm cocoon of love and safety, which we conveniently ignored all this while. As I spend more and more time at home, I realise how much I do not miss anything outside. I love the lazy breakfast, lying around aimlessly, working from the couch, late night binging. No pressure to dress up or look presentable. What a blessing. \n\nNever been this fond of home. Never stepping out of my comfort zone.  Created this small little cozy space for myself with @binary_home_ furnishings\nsofa throw and cushion covers. \n\n🎊Use coupon code BHAKUTI15 to get 15% discount on Binary Home products.

Or firmly staying at home? \n\nI touched on this in my column this month @join.the.flock about our re-emergence from #lockdown (or not), as is the case for millions of households in the North of England today who woke up to the news of a #locallockdown.\n\nThe summer is normally a time for carefree living, family time, holidays and pressing \u2018pause\u2019 before the onslaught of that final third of the year, and the hurtling speed at which we get thrown back into life and all the excesses that come with it.\n\nBut it\u2019s not \u2018quite\u2019 the summer we are used to is it? \n\nThere is nothing \u2018normal\u2019 or \u2018typical\u2019 or \u2018usual\u2019 about the summer of 2020 at all is there?\n\nWhilst some people have made the decision to holiday outside of the U.K., others have made the decision to holiday in the UK and many have made the decision to stay home for the foreseeable future. \n\nWhatever your decision, it\u2019s your decision. There\u2019s no judgement. Travel is allowed. For some the very thought of a summer with no break is not an option. For others, there is no choice but to stay home or the choice to stay at home is very much a conscious one. \n\nWhat are you doing this summer? \n\nThis was snapped last year in #wales. We\u2019ve made the choice not to holiday this summer and we\u2019ve cancelled our 5th wedding anniversary trip to #NYC later in the year. There is a camping trip on the horizon which I\u2019m staying home ON MY OWN whilst my husband spends a few nights with the kids on blow up beds in a field somewhere- I\u2019ve booked 4 days off work and to say I\u2019m looking forward to a staycation at home with myself is an understatement 🤣. \n\nAnd I\u2019ve found us an alternative wedding anniversary break too. A cabin in the woods in the middle of the nowhere #offgrid. It\u2019s got a four poster bed, log fires and a copper free standing bath. It\u2019s booked and we\u2019ll *hopefully* be escaping there for 2 nights later in the year. \n\nBut that\u2019s the thing. \n\nPlanning ahead in a pandemic is fuelled with uncertainty. We are learning in real time that things can change in an instant, and we don\u2019t always respond well to change do we? For now, it\u2019s #aperolspritz time and a homemade curry. Enjoy your weekend 😘","NumberOfLikes":78,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Catherine Asta Labbett on July 31, 2020 tagging @thisiswhistles, @oliverbonas, and @kemitelford.

As a seventeen year old, creating an Instagram page didn\u2019t really mean much to me. Back then, there was no one making Mandalas (at least among my friends and acquaintances). For me, it was (and still is) a form of therapy. The only reason I moved away from Mandalas and Zentangles was because they were too time consuming and also because I found making doodles a much simpler act. But, I always feel that when it comes to doodling, I\u2019m very much a noob. Even with calligraphy, I\u2019m just trying it out. I tried making digital mandalas too but they just didn\u2019t have the same feeling. During the lockdown, I tried my hand at making mandalas but I failed terribly because I\u2019d completely lost touch. The patterns didn\u2019t come to me as naturally as they used to before. I was so distracted I couldn\u2019t even complete a project in one go. I gave up! Repeatedly. \n\nHowever, today I decided to pick up a Mandala, from where I had left it months ago (I\u2019d thought it was ruined). It isn\u2019t my best work, obviously. But at least it\u2019s a start. And hopefully, I can get back to making more of these super soon!\n\n#_mandala_drawings #mandalas #mandalalovers #mandalasharing #mandalasofinstagram #mandala #follow #indian #patterns #tutorials #pinterest #tagblender #blackandwhite #monochrome #covid #lockdowndiaries #medstudentdiaries #medschooldiaries #art #artistsoninstagramfollowme #artpage #etsyshop","NumberOfLikes":50,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":11,"Timestamp":1596204806,"LocalDate":"Fri Jul 31 16:13:26 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#munia #scalybreastedmunia #birdfanning #lockdowndiaries #couplegoals #nature","NumberOfLikes":69,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1596204654,"LocalDate":"Fri Jul 31 16:10:54 CEST 2020","Location":"Kalyan"},{"CaptionText":"#lucknow #mutualfunds #sip #systematicinvestmentplans #systematicinvestmentplan #investment #equityinvestments #financialfreedom #financialplanning #india#lockdownsessions #lockdownlife #uttarpradesh#mutualfundssahihai #stocks #stockmarketstrategies#lucknowcity #lockdownlife #lockdowndiaries#lucknowst #lucknowites #lucknowdiaries❤#investmentbehavior#investment opportunity#medicalinsurance #mediclaiminsurance #medicalhealth#lucknowtimes #lucknowblogger #lucknowinfluencers #lucknowlove#photooftheday","NumberOfLikes":5,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Investways Fincon Pvt.

The trick to making Kale smoothies taste great is to add plenty of sweet fruits to mask the bitter taste 😍\n\nThis recipe makes 2 large servings. Here's what you need for this smoothie:\n\u2023 1 cup almond milk (can be replaced with any fruit juice\/coconut water or plain water)\n\u2023 1\/3rd of a banana (add more if you like banana in smoothies)\n\u2023 1.25 cup pineapple cubes\n\u2023 1.25 cup frozen mango cubes (i use frozen mango to chill my smoothie without adding any ice)\n\u2023 2\" piece of ginger\n\u2023 2 cups of kale leaves\n\nAdd all the ingredients in the order listed above and blend until you have a beautiful green smoothie 😍 I used my @vitamix to get a super smooth consistency.

Never did we imagine, the lockdown to be the handcuffs to our freedom. The little elements of freedom like walking to a station, commuting to office, meeting friends along the way or just going freely to a shopping arcade without a mask. The new evolving normal has got us rethinking on the definition of freedom - did we underestimate it earlier? \n\nMumbai is said to be the city of dreams for everyone who comes to the city. As residents of the city or as Mumbaikars, have we underestimated the value of our daily life? Have we got so busy in our day to day lives, that we did not value the little things we enjoyed doing in the city like catching a noisey packed local train, eating our fav roadside sandwich, sitting along the waterfront enjoying the water flow, going to the beach, a long drive late at night or going to restaurants. Something to think over indeed. \n\nTill then let's sit at home watching the beautiful birds fly around enjoying the non polluted and peaceful environment. \n\n#lockdown #lockdown2020 #lockdownlife #lockdowndiaries #lockdownmemes #lockdownphotography #environment #environmentallyfriendly #birds #birdsofinstagram #birdstagram #instagram #mumbaikar #mumbai #outsidemywindow #loveforlove #loveforheritage #flying #loveforall #workfromhome #workfromhomelife #workfromhomejobs #workfromhomeopportunity #safe #safetyfirst #saferathome #safety #safeathome #safespace #staysafe","NumberOfLikes":206,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Amruta in Mumbai, Maharashtra with @mumbai_igers, @mumbai_uncensored, @nature, @_aamchi_mumbai_, @livehistoryindia, @mumbaiguide_, @unseen.mumbai, @wahhmumbai, @photographers.of.mumbai, @lockdown_0memes, @vantasmumbai, @maximum_mumbai, @naturephotography__53, @birds_photography_beginners, @lockdown_gig, @_lockdown__photography_, @bombaycitylights, @mumbaimasala.official, and @lockdown_musings8.
