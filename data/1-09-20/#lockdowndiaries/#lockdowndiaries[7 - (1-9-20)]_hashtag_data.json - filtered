This is in the longer walking route  to-from my previous work in the museum, but I like it more since it's the calmer one with lesser vehicle traffic. It's grimier too, but in Manila grime is actually commonplace it's no longer bothersome. Heniway, I'm sure this garden helped the barangay during the lockdown.

And even then it was a pic in my night gown trying to convince a friend to meet as is because the 1st lockdown had eased and we were slowly WANTING to get back together. Thankfully we met.

When I was in Dubai, my Amma had a Sindhi colleague in her bank by the name of Gobind Thawrani. He was always ready to help out and whenever he came to Bombay to meet his parents, he faithfully got back some sev barfi. The best thing about this sweet, is that you can have it cold or warm. When we came back to India in 1996, we used to get our stash from Tharu in Khar West and more recently from Chembur diagonally opposite Vigs. Bathed in ghee and cloying sweet, but I loved to have a few spoons of it as well as the cylindrical gulab jamuns with a single pistachio in the middle! Then @just.a.pinchofsalt showed me the menu by @chiselledmealsbymeeta last week and there was no doubt that we were getting the sev barfi from her. We ordered just 250 g (I wish we had ordered a kilo of this hehe!) and the first mouthful itself was heavenly! A generous amount of almond and pistachio flakes, the required amount of ghee and the absolute perfect degree of sweetness... The consistency was almost like the khara prashad! Guys if you want to taste good, homestyle sev barfi, Meeta Kataria is your go to lady!

Do you think anyone will forget me? ü§™ü§£\n-\nSo far this  pandemic has affected us for \nüí•1\/3rd of a year, üí•5 months, üí•126 days of lockdown and üí•18 weeks of social distancing. \n-\n\nBy the end of this week and since mid March I will have planned, run and\/or delivered: \nüí´110 online classes (5,500+ minutes), \nüí´38 story times, \nüí´28 lives or zoom chats -alone or with partners, \nüí´12 yoga bursts, \nüí´7 private social media groups, \nüí´5 baby development activity tasters, \nüí´4 online parties,\nüí´2 competitions, \nüí´2 free worthy cause events and \nüí´3 days as host on the national Tots Play Families Group. \n-\n\nToday marks the start of what is likely to be my last full week of solely online classes and I feel really emotional after all that time with you, watching your little ones grow on screen. You have always kept me going through this challenging time and I can never thank you enough for booking classes and even if you didn\u2019t come to online classes so many of you recommend me to friends, like and share my work and send me the most amazing messages.\n-\n\nIt\u2019s not quite over for me yet but hopefully with your support I can build my business back up but for August,at least, I\u2019ll be just a little quieter.  I will be spending time with my family before my youngest starts school in September and I taking my first real break since February. \n-\n\nI\u2019ll miss you all in August but don\u2019t fear I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll plan in something special for those of you who want to play. \n-\n\nAs we emerge into this new world, stay safe, love life, laugh loud  and learn through play. \n-\n\nThank you for choosing me and supporting me üíì\n-\n\nGeorgie xxx","NumberOfLikes":36,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":7,"Timestamp":1595879385,"LocalDate":"Mon Jul 27 21:49:45 CEST 2020","Location":"Stafford Registery Office"},{"Owner":"creative_crafty_soul","CaptionText":"Nataraja-\"Lord of the Dance\"\u2063\n. \u2063\n. \u2063\n. \u2063\nA beautiful sketch of a Lord Shiva in form of natraja. \u2063\n. \u2063\n. \u2063\nDo follow :@creative_crafty_soul\n\n#natraja #shivashakti_forever #sketchings #sawangan #mahadeva #mahadev #artistsoÔ¨Ånstagram #sketchbook #drawings #spirituality #ishafoundation #prideüåà #artist_features #followbackalways #dailyart #artofinsta #instagramartwork #kalamkari #2020vision #lockdowndiaries #artofthedayüé® #sawanspecial #mahakalkebhakt #mondayvibes #leafart #artistrystudio #artistry_flair","NumberOfLikes":20,"Hashtags":["#natraja","#shivashakti_forever","#sketchings","#sawangan","#mahadeva","#mahadev","#artistsoÔ¨Ånstagram","#sketchbook","#drawings","#spirituality","#ishafoundation","#prideüåà","#artist_features","#followbackalways","#dailyart","#artofinsta","#instagramartwork","#kalamkari","#2020vision","#lockdowndiaries","#artofthedayüé®","#sawanspecial","#mahakalkebhakt","#mondayvibes","#leafart","#artistrystudio","#artistry_flair"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":7,"Timestamp":1595879291,"LocalDate":"Mon Jul 27 21:48:11 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"i_the_relentless","CaptionText":"#punch till you can punch no more #skip till you can skip no more #speedropes #footwork #stamina #workoutroutine #workoutmotivation #fitnessmotivation #fitfam #patna #bihar #lockdowndiaries #coronavirus #coronawarriors","NumberOfLikes":4,"Hashtags":["#punch","#skip","#speedropes","#footwork","#stamina","#workoutroutine","#workoutmotivation","#fitnessmotivation","#fitfam","#patna","#bihar","#lockdowndiaries","#coronavirus","#coronawarriors"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1595878631,"LocalDate":"Mon Jul 27 21:37:11 CEST 2020","Location":"Patna, India"},{"Owner":"priya_sharma_vocalist","CaptionText":"Happiest Birthday my darling sisterüéÇüòòüòç‚ù§Ô∏è\nMay god bless you with lods of happiness and huge successüòò you are starüòç and i love you so much üòçüòò‚ù§Ô∏èüíô @sonamsharma55902 \n\n#birthday #birthdaygirl #celebration #love #lifeisbeautiful #birthdaysuprise #sistersquad #soulsisters #turning24 #cakesofinstagram #instagood #happiness #familytime #familycelebration #enjoythelittlethings #lockdowndiaries #happybirthday #bestday","NumberOfLikes":79,"Hashtags":["#birthday","#birthdaygirl","#celebration","#love","#lifeisbeautiful","#birthdaysuprise","#sistersquad","#soulsisters","#turning24","#cakesofinstagram","#instagood","#happiness","#familytime","#familycelebration","#enjoythelittlethings","#lockdowndiaries","#happybirthday","#bestday"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1595878597,"LocalDate":"Mon Jul 27 21:36:37 CEST 2020","Location":"Haridwar : The City Of Love & Nature"},{"Owner":"anysiapillay","CaptionText":"Wherever you go, no matter what the weather, always bring your own sunshine. \n#farmdays #lockdown2020 #lockdowndiaries #westerncape #capetownmom #capetown #threeyearsold #summerdaysinwinter","NumberOfLikes":51,"Hashtags":["#farmdays","#lockdown2020","#lockdowndiaries","#westerncape","#capetownmom","#capetown","#threeyearsold","#summerdaysinwinter"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Anysia Pillay in Anna Beulah Farm.

Like most of you, I\u2019m so flamin\u2019 confused about what we can and can\u2019t do. COVID logic has well and truly set in! But what is absolutely clear, is the importance of wearing a mask or face covering.\n.\n.\nTo help you understand when, where and why, I pulled together the below from a variety of reputable sources. \n.\n. \n‚≠êÔ∏èFrom 24th July, it\u2019s mandatory (the law) to wear a mask or face covering in shops, supermarkets and on public transport in England (rules may differ in other parts of the UK)\n‚≠êÔ∏è This also covers NHS settings, banks, building societies and the post office \n‚≠êÔ∏è Basic rule of thumb; if you\u2019re indoors and in public, you need a face covering\n‚≠êÔ∏è There are exemptions to this, such as restaurants, bars, cafes, visitor attractions, entertainment (e.g. cinema) and sports venues (e.g. gyms)\n‚≠êÔ∏è You can also remove your mask or face covering to eat or drink if you\u2019re in a designated food area, like a food court\n‚≠êÔ∏è Your mask must cover your mouth and nose, be fitted at the side and be comfortable to breath in\n‚≠êÔ∏èIt is not compulsory for under 11s to wear masks \n‚≠êÔ∏è It\u2019s not recommended that under 3s wear masks or face coverings for health and safety reasons\n‚≠êÔ∏è It\u2019s also advised (although NOT mandatory) to wear face coverings in enclosed public spaces where social distancing is difficult or you\u2019re meeting with people you don\u2019t normally socialise with \n‚≠êÔ∏èMasks are largely to protect others, rather than the wearer, as they cover the nose and mouth area, the confirmed sources of main transmission of the virus that causes COVID \n.\n.\nSo in a nutshell, wear a mask or face covering when you\u2019re out and about to protect others. Be a good human and this will be over a heck of a lot quicker!!\n.\n.\nFor more in-depth info, please visit the below sources:\n.\n.\nSources: @nhswebsite @ukgovofficial @simplepolitics","NumberOfLikes":222,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Kelly ‚≠êÔ∏è work\/life juggler ‚≠êÔ∏è on July 26, 2020 tagging @accessorize, and @mimiandlula.

I began following @abhishekhanna and seeing his stellar work, and I thought to myself - maybe I can give this a try! ‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nAnd fortuitously enough - my mom made this sumptuous curry for the day. I shellebrated, because I knew then and there that this would be an Ande Funday. (I'll stop with the bad yolks now, hope they made you crack up xD) My mom had sourced the ripest, reddest tomatoes and I was dying to use them in a shoot. So I grabbed a few from the kitchen, along with some other accoutrements - lemons, garlic, coriander, and some chillies! We also had two chopping boards neatly stacked in the bottom shelf, which I planned to use as the base.‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nI then proceeded to MasterChef the hell out of that curry - sprinkling the leaves, arranging the accompaniments around the centerpiece in the most decorative manner possible. And finally, I turned on my camera! These are some of my favorite shots from the day :))‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nI've never really spent much time in the kitchen, besides helping myself to an extra serving of that delish payasam.

In 1672, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj captured it from Adilshah. The first to be seen on this fort is the Hemadpanthi temple of Bhairavnath with a different style. There are overlays, arches and lanterns around the temple. There is a flagpole and a cannon on the bastion in front of the temple. As you walk along the path behind the temple, you will see a magnificent mansion built of laterite stone. There are remnants of main court on the fort. As you walk along the footpath near the fort, you come across the magnificent Dudhsagar Lake. The water in it has become milky in color due to the properties of the soil. There is a beautiful armed idol of Adishakti Bhavani Mata in the ruined Bhavani Mandir near the lake. If you continue on the straight path to the east, there is remnant of an entrance of the fort. There are 2 dry wells and two lakes.\n\n@virajt_dd11 @girlonthemountains @rupali_kamtekar @aniketkhedekar_ @shodhashodh @jayedeepjagtap1 and Me üòâ","NumberOfLikes":79,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1595692517,"LocalDate":"Sat Jul 25 17:55:17 CEST 2020","Location":"Bhudargad Fort"},{"Owner":"ragee_rgs","CaptionText":"Since my page name and design was not final... hereby i am posting my earlier posts in my official frame.

Talking about the technicalities of the recipe, all you need is a mixer grinder, a few mangoes, and a bowl of homemade custard.

But I feel like it is not that, yet I cannot confront it as much as I try. \n\nI\u2019ve struggled with overcoming trauma in my life and still do. I fought it for so long but have had to accept it is apart of me and has shaped me as a person.But like all types of traumas it creeps up on you unexpectedly and I still struggle with that.  I become so numb to the world around me. But yet there is an expectation of me and other women to still smile and act like everything is fine...even when people know you are struggling it can be exhausting at times. Yet I still find myself rarely sitting to reflect deeply on my thoughts instead I run from them by keeping busy.. then to find myself detached from myself when I see my reflection in the mirror and then trying to pick up the pieces that are left of me.\n\nI guess what I am trying to say is that you never know what someone is going through many have perfected the art of masking it.
