The pre-recorded interviews take place via Zoom and are posted every Tuesday afternoon. You can find them all on the Different Strokes website, Facebook page and YouTube channel - but over the next couple of weeks, a snippet of each already posted to the DS channels are going to be introduced to our wonderful Instagram audience, to give everyone a taster of personal affiliation with each survivor.\u2063\n\u2063\nLockdown interview number four features stroke survivors Sheelagh and Greet. Sheelagh is our Administrator at Different Strokes. She had her stroke in 2018 at the age of 51. Greet works for the NHS and had her stroke just six months ago at the age of 45. Greet spoke to Sheelagh about her misdiagnosis during stroke and her diagnoses after stroke - Wallenberg Syndrome and Central Post Stroke Pain. During lockdown, Greet chats about the difficulties of being disabled with social restrictions, what it\u2019s like having a vibrant little boy in the early chapters of post stroke recovery, missing out on seeing and staying with family in Belgium and replacement exercises she\u2019s been doing to substitute her usual routine. She also talks about the after effects of her stroke, how lucky she felt to be receiving quality aftercare just before the pandemic struck, problems with work, how her stroke will now give her extra empathy being a child physiotherapist in her new job and how the support from Different Strokes has helped her come to terms with her new life.\u2063\n\u2063\nCatch the full interview at:\u2063\n🔗 https:\/\/differentstrokes.co.uk\/stroke-survivor-experiences-during-lockdown\/\u2063\n▶️ https:\/\/youtu.be\/nNBMW414umk\u2063\n👍🏼 https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/differentstrokescharity\/\u2063","NumberOfLikes":17,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1595589016,"LocalDate":"Fri Jul 24 13:10:16 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"@aazthasharma \n\n#savage #glam #gladiator #gladiatorheels #black #ootd #ootn #outfitinspo #stairs #indoorphotography #poser #fitgirls #instadaily #instagood #outfitoftheday #quarantine #lockdowndiaries #dressup  #homephotoshoot #kneehigh #shoes #shoelover #shoesaddict #style #styleblogger #blogger #photography #indoor #black #xoxo","NumberOfLikes":3,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by pics on July 24, 2020.

My saree pallu drape has changed with the time so would like to share one memory connected to it in short. Since childhood I have been around beautiful ladies with colorful sarees full time and highly fascinated by them.\n\nWhen I got engaged, I used to drape in 1. Pleated pallu style as I was not fully confident and was too much concern about saree coming out 😬. \nAfter marriage 2.Head drape was compulsory and as I was not use to it I use to put so many pins on head to set the pallu.\nDuring pregnancy I use to prefer 3. Wrapped around shoulder drape to cover my tummy ( use to feel shy😜).When kids were small half of the time my saree pallu was 4.  tucked in petticoat for free movement.\n Later when kids grew up was little free from taking them in Lap so started with 5. Flowing drape. \nToday when girls grew up , I take help of my girls in styling my sarees and selection of  blouse and accessories. Now I am 100% confident and I love to wear and carry myself  in different styles. Being a saree lover,I love to try and  take  saree styling  to newer, trendier heights.\nYou may not realize, but the modest pallu has the power to make or break your saree look from traditional to uber chic by varying pallu drapes. I remember sometimes I use to do certain changes while tieing  and carrying  saree and pallu to look slimmer,  taller, sometimes to add an illusion of weight.🙈\n\n❓Ladies Which one is your fav pallu drape ???\nAnd gentlemens which drape you like the most???\n123\n456\n\nDo share your pallu drape stories👍\n#smilemore #photooftheday❤️ #styleblogger #style \n#lockdowndiaries #loveforsarees❤️\n#motivationalquotes #chennaiinfluencer #chennaimommyblogger  #spiritualawakening #instamom #mommybloggers #mombloggersofindia  #fashionlover #fashionbloggerindia #igram #explorepage #stylegram #lookoftheday  #affordablefashion  #styleblogger  #pictoftheday  #fashionlover #fashionbloggerindia #igram #stylegram #iconiclook #personalstyle #ss07insta # brands2bloggers","NumberOfLikes":145,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Meraki on July 24, 2020.

There is no professional help in running the household and everything is on you and the members of the family. Some have lost their jobs, while for some, there are extended work hours because nobody knows now when the working day begins and when it ends.⠀\n⠀\nPeople are putting in more than 14 hours a day at work; the current work from home style involves dependence on digital devices for longer than before which has its own set of inbuilt harmful consequences. These actions can have a damaging effect on psychology. ⠀\n⠀\nTherapy is very useful and often Self Therapy gains a prominent role during times of uncertainty to feel more grounded. Offer yourself some Self Care even if it\u2019s for 15 minutes. When emotionally tired, choose Journaling as Writing Therapy. Write down what you have learnt and what will you choose to learn to cope with next. When you write, your mind becomes clear and the mental log jam releases thereby energising you too.⠀\n------------------------------------------------⠀\n𝐅𝐎𝐋𝐋𝐎𝐖: @khyatibirlacoach⠀\n𝐍𝐄𝐖 𝐁𝐋𝐎𝐆: https:\/\/khyatibirla.com\/stress-management-during-covid-times\/⠀\n𝐋𝐈𝐍𝐊 𝐈𝐍 𝐁𝐈𝐎⠀\n------------------------------------------------⠀\n#mentalhealthmatters #lockdowndiaries #mentalhealthtips #covid19india #emotionalwellbeing #empowermentcoach #covidart #mentalwellbeing #mentalhealthsupport #covi̇d19 #mentalhealthblog #covidー19 #mentalhealthadvocate #odbo #girlempowerment #womanempowerment #allinthistogether #lockdownbirthday #womensupportwomen #covid2019 #mentalhealthstigma #mentalhealthrecovery #lockdownindia #mentalhealthawarness #youthempowerment #ipswichwellbeing #healthyhappywomen #mentalhealthweek #empowerment","NumberOfLikes":7,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1595518553,"LocalDate":"Thu Jul 23 17:35:53 CEST 2020","Location":"Mumbai, Maharashtra"},{"CaptionText":"Ended the beginning of 27 with some @naturalicecream\n.\n.\n#icecream #lockdownbirthday2020 #lockdown #lockdowndiaries #birthdaygirl #birthday #birthdayfun #mangoicecream #masked","NumberOfLikes":76,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Vaidika Parashar in Galleria Market - DLF gurgaon.

Although the entrance of Kalanidhigad is small, it is very beautiful. Once inside through this door you see the fort divided into two parts. In one part, there is a tower of the telecommunications department and in the rest are the remains of the fort. On the left hand side in front of the door you can see many old buildings. It has two temples. The first temple has a Shivling with an idol of Bhairava behind it. In the second temple, there is a small but beautiful and well-armed idol of Goddess Bhavani, the ruler of the fort. Two wells are dug in a square tank. One of these wells is filled with trees, while the other is in use. You see the old castle next to the telecom department office. On the east side of the fort, there is an enchanting view of the serpentine character of the river Tamraparni.\n\n@shodhashodh @aniketkhedekar_ @girlonthemountains @rupali_kamtekar @virajt_dd11 @jayedeepjagtap1 and Me😉","NumberOfLikes":70,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":9,"Timestamp":1595514329,"LocalDate":"Thu Jul 23 16:25:29 CEST 2020","Location":"Kalanidhigad,chandgad"},{"CaptionText":"Cutest bored baby 🥰\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n#reelkarofeelkaro #reel #reelitfeelit #feelspecial #cute #lovewhatido #anegabawaphotography #reeltoreel #reellife #lockdownlife #lockdowndiaries #cutebabiesofinstagram #cute #babiesofinstagram #baby #babyphotoshoots #love","NumberOfLikes":18,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Elie on July 23, 2020.

The social aspect of my job is what gets me up in the morning. Although technology has enabled us do things that wouldn't have been possible in the past, I still believe that there is no replacing face to face connection. At times it has been hard to accept the limitations. However, these challenges have motivated the whole team to find new ways to connect and support our people.\n\nFurther, the lack of noise has also proven an opportunity to think clearly about what is important to me, and it seems that our residents and communities feel the same. From what I have heard, there has been a real positive response to this lockdown. There is a desire from all quarters, to be more actively involved in where they live, work and play. From the NHS clap, to supporting their vulnerable neighbours; the response has been amazing across London. Everyone I have spoken to wants this spirit of care and empathy to continue long after this is over.\n\nAnd we at NPG are ready to help them do it.\u201D \n\n#lockdowndiaries #workingfromhomelife #office #customerexperience","NumberOfLikes":10,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Navana Property Group on July 23, 2020.

You can find them all on the Different Strokes website, Facebook page and YouTube channel - but over the next couple of weeks, a snippet of each already posted to the DS channels are going to be introduced to our wonderful Instagram audience, to give everyone a taster of personal affiliation with each survivor.\u2063\n\u2063\nLockdown interview number three features stroke survivors Sheelagh and Andy.

Andy spoke to Sheelagh about his life before and after stroke and the challenges he\u2019s faced along the way. He also chats about his change of routine during lockdown; having his children homeschooling, the activities and sensory exposure he\u2019s missing, the exercise necessary for his stabilising recovery having to stop and how he\u2019s built his own space at home, and the tips and strategies he has on how to read efficiently with a post stroke brain.\u2063\n\u2063\n Catch the full interview at:\u2063\n🔗 https:\/\/differentstrokes.co.uk\/stroke-survivor-experiences-during-lockdown\/\u2063\n▶️ https:\/\/youtu.be\/nNBMW414umk\u2063\n👍🏼 https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/differentstrokescharity\/\u2063","NumberOfLikes":17,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1595502807,"LocalDate":"Thu Jul 23 13:13:27 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Follow @florafashion2020 for many updates 💌\n\nDM me for prices \nFabric: Kurti -  Crepe , Jacket - Crepe\nSleeve Length: Three-Quarter Sleeves\nWork \/ Pattern: Kurti - Solid , Jacket - Printed\nCombo of: Single\nSizes:\nKurti - XS - 34in, S - 36in, M - 38 in, L - 40 in, XL - 42 in, XXL - 44 in , Jacket -  XS - 34in, S - 36in, M - 38 in, L - 40 in, XL - 42 in, XXL - 44 in\n\n#kurtisale #serialaddict #suntvserial #vijaytvserial #suryabday #lockdowndiaries #lessprice_fashionista\u203C #lesspriceauthentic #staysafe #stayhealthy #tamilysharesm #tamilshareslove #girlywear #tamilgirls #tamilgirl #tamilgirlsdubmash \n\nFollow @florafashion2020 for many updates","NumberOfLikes":11,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1595502768,"LocalDate":"Thu Jul 23 13:12:48 CEST 2020","Location":"Karur, India"},{"CaptionText":"Vanilla scoop with choco flare💛\n\nHomemade vanilla ice scoop is jus d reflection of calmness and composed mood🤙🤙💮💮\n\nDo support @ms_basandani like share follow and comment 🍫💕\n\n#vanilla #vanillascoop #icecreamcookies #ice #icebox #icecreamcone #icecreamparty #homemadecreamer #scoop #vanillaclub #thaidessert #homemadetaste #tasteofindia #loveofindianfood #indianfood #flavor #vanillaflavour #vanillaflavor #foodaroundtheworld #foodroma #icecreamheaven #heaven #heavenonearth #heavensent #lockdowndiaries #chocolatebranco\n#chocolatesauce\n#homemadechocolatesauce\n\nChoco_vanny_Creamy_moment😍😘","NumberOfLikes":49,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Homemade Express Eat's in India with @icecreamking, @naturalicecream, @sloans_southflorida, @havmoricecreams, @amul_india, @roamingforfood, @icecream, @icecreamrolls, @icecreambae, @icecreamworksindia, @ice_cream_tales, @brainfreeze.india, @sweettoothforever, @creamyfun_, @icecream_amul, @swaad.manchala, and @icecreamonlyy.

Ever felt as if no one understands\/feels you?\nA. This book does. \n\nThis book is addressed to a stranger (the reader) about whom the writer doesn't know but feels. It includes 30 poems and letters on various topics such as pain, anxiety, heartache, health, positivity, second chances, failure, kindness, happiness and many more. The book represents a 30 day journey for self-discovery. I thought to give it a read as it was lockdown and everything was dark, this book proved to be that little beacon of light. The language is easy and there is no age bar. The book is absolute perfect for the new readers as well as non-readers as well. Maybe at times, it would happen that the book feels long, less engaging or less connect as compared to fiction books. I would recommend to read the book at least once to everyone as it is important for self.

I would show up even if I was having a bad day. I listened carefully. I did all the assignments as though the instructor, like my piano teacher back in the day, had a stick with which to hit me for not doing as told.\n\nThus, well, upon receiving this piece of paper, I jumped for joy! I paid for this class, though it is only one of five specializations, which means I should expect four more certificates from this course alone.\n\nNow I'm thinking of going back to the courses I've completed but only audited -- European Paintings (1400s-1900s) at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Contemporary Art at MoMA, and Poetry at California Institute of the Arts -- and pay for them so I can claim my certificates.\n\n#onlineschooling\n#newnorms\n#creativewriting \n#latebloomer \n#quarantinejournal\n#lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":45,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by AA Patawaran in Manila, Philippines.","NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1595478311,"LocalDate":"Thu Jul 23 06:25:11 CEST 2020","Location":"Manila, Philippines"},{"CaptionText":"𝑊𝑒 𝑎𝑟𝑒 𝑛𝑜𝑡 𝑤ℎ𝑎𝑡 𝑤𝑒 𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑤\n𝑊𝑒 𝑎𝑟𝑒 𝑤ℎ𝑎𝑡 𝑤𝑒 𝐻𝑖𝑑𝑒 🤍\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n𝗙𝗼𝗿 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝘃𝗲𝗹  𝗳𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗼𝘄 @sassy_tamzz \n𝗙𝗼𝗿  𝗠𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗰 𝗳𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗼𝘄 @sassy_tamzz \n𝗙𝗼𝗿 𝗙𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗳𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗼𝘄  @sassy_tamzz \n𝗙𝗼𝗿 𝗟𝗼𝘃𝗲 𝗳𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗼𝘄 @sassy_tamzz \n\n#𝒘𝒆𝒍𝒐𝒗𝒆 \n#𝒘𝒆𝒄𝒂𝒓𝒆\n#𝑾𝒆𝒇𝒊𝒈𝒉𝒕\n#𝑺𝒂𝒔𝒔𝒔𝒚𝑻𝒂𝒎𝒛 \n#lovecouples #liveyourdreamlife #weddingseason2019 #friendsmarriage #marriedtomedicine #travelcouples #coupleblogger #musiclover🎶 #musicismydrug #danceoff #sweatissexy #struggleisreal #missingthosedays #beforequarantine #beforecovid19 #lockdowndiaries #missingtravel #twirling #tarvelwithsassytamzz#sassytamzz","NumberOfLikes":145,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":12,"Timestamp":1595475384,"LocalDate":"Thu Jul 23 05:36:24 CEST 2020","Location":"Chennai, India"},{"CaptionText":"Cabin fever.

And it has been nice! But it's also involved things like visiting shops I've not been to for months and seeing them full of cordons and plastic shields; seeing the difference for the first time is always more difficult than watching things gradually change. Things like being surrounded by families in the park who are trying to pretend that they're having fun. They were looking forward to having fun, their eyes all say. They don't know what to do now it's miserable here as well.\n\nI know a lot of people have found this time hard, much harder than they thought they would. And they don't know how to say it's been hard because it wasn't supposed to be hard, and being unhappy is always harder when you're somewhere that's meant to be nice. At times like this I often think I need to tell myself a new story that can cope with how messy my actual life and feelings are. I'm not sure I've thought of one quite yet. But I think it's important to admit that I'm trying to find one, rather than to pretend the one I had is working especially well.\n\n#depression #lockdowndiaries #pessimism #depressiondrawing #pandemicart #depressionart #depressionposts","NumberOfLikes":22,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Robert Shepherd in Edinburgh, United Kingdom.

The pre-recorded interviews take place via Zoom and are posted every Tuesday afternoon. You can find them all on the Different Strokes website, Facebook page and YouTube channel - but over the next couple of weeks, a snippet of each already posted to the DS channels are going to be introduced to our wonderful Instagram audience, to give everyone a taster of personal affiliation with each survivor.\u2063\n\u2063\nLockdown interview number two features stroke survivors Sheelagh and Pamela. Sheelagh is our Administrator at Different Strokes. She had her stroke in 2018 at the age of 51. Pamela is a regular attendee of the DS Carlisle support group and had her stroke 4 and a half years ago. Pamela spoke to Sheelagh about disruption to her rehab progress, missing face to face contact but appreciating the ropes of technology, and using this time to achieve goals and paint her stroke experience as a positive advantage.

We were informed that the bull was there since the previous night and that the Fire Department had attempted rescue once already this morning but were unable to get him out. After speaking with the locals, the ward councilor for the area Mrs. Borkar and team and the Fire Dept of Vasco, our team visited the site to verify the ground situation. All options were considered & It was clear that the bull will need to be lifted out of the nallah as it's walls were completely vertical and there was no other way to help the bull climb out. \n\nAt this point we contacted the Dept of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services via the govt-ngo WhatsApp group and requested assistance. \n\nDirector of Animal Husbandry & Veterinary Services Dept Dr Santosh Desai immediately got in touch with the concerned departments like the Deputy Collectors office and the Veterinary officer for Vasco and mobilized action from their end. We in turn contacted Mormugao Municipal Council Vice Chairperson Reema Sonurlekar for assistance who also responded immediately. We received positive response from the Fire Dept to do a second attempt at rescue. \n\nBoth Dr Samaya ( Veterinary Officer, Vasco) & MMC Vice Chairperson Reema Sonurlekar reached the site along with the Fire Dept & PFA Vasco team. \n\nThe bull was secured using ropes  which was quite a challenge as it was tired and scared. nallah was filled with sewage and garbage. After many attempts, Fire Dept managed to secure it safely. And with help of PFA Vasco team, MMC staff and locals , the bull was hauled out of the nullah. \n\nIt charged at all of us and fell in the field on the opposite side. It was tired and after a few minutes of rest, we were able to remove the ropes (locals helped us but getting blades to cut the ropes). \nThe bull, though exhausted, charged us one last time and walked away into the fields without a single scratch on him.\nRescue concluded at 5.10pm on 21st July. \n\nMany thanks to Dept of AH &VS, Mormugao Municipal Council, Ward members, Fire Dept, Veterinary Officer Vasco , locals and Team PFA","NumberOfLikes":146,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1595342838,"LocalDate":"Tue Jul 21 16:47:18 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"How are these !!? \nTried them 😋\n\n#lockdowndiaries #simple #socialdistancing #Covid19 #coronavirus #oilpastelsart #oilpastels #camlin_official \n#attempt #vegetables #colourful @mandala_vibes9","NumberOfLikes":54,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by @cre8.tiv.cloud on July 21, 2020 tagging @camlin_official, and @mandala_featuring.page.","NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1595342798,"LocalDate":"Tue Jul 21 16:46:38 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"First attempt in making a swiss roll ..

Whether it be the use of firewood for  cooking, the giant pans with steaming hot tea, the earthy smell of lassi and chai kulhad, the inhouse preparations of scrumptious spices, the fresh harvest from their backyard farms, their mouth watering pickles, the welcoming aroma of Indian hospitality.  Everything about a dhaba brings that smile on our lips when we eat home cooked food.  There\u2019s nothing like having hot maggie in grey and damp weather in a bamboo constructed dhaba set against a rugged terrain.

Or perhaps it\u2019s just that we are living through a global pandemic at a time where covering our face is suddenly compulsory? Perhaps it\u2019s the eerie vibe that has returned to our streets? #imisshappymelbourne\n\nToday wasn\u2019t a good day. I cried. A lot actually. Over nothing and over everything. \nIt actually wasn\u2019t to do with homeschooling, and everything to do with my sensitive little heart feeling all the feels of living in a time where everything is unknown. The collective anxiety and sadness that so many are feeling, really got me today. \n\nMissing my parents and siblings. Missing human connection. Missing my freedom (which is a confusing notion in itself!). Going for a walk and smiling at people wearing a mask. Are they smiling back? Who knows! Today - I really hate this, and found it hard to see a bright side. Of course there were little moments of lovely today, but they took a back seat. \n\nThere\u2019s a balance between trying to remain grateful, present and compassionate, and then feeling out of control, sad and angry. Unexpectedly the balance tipped towards the latter today. \n\nI know it\u2019s ok. I know it\u2019s normal, and I know the sun will rise in the morning, and maybe I\u2019ll feel a little brighter. \n\nOnwards the rollercoaster goes.

It moves on the lips when you rub them together. If you\u2019re looking for longevity & kiss proof qualities then give it a pass. You will need to reapply this one. Try their powder kiss matte lipstick instead. They are more resilient than the liquid variation. I have no qualms with the above cons so I\u2019m pro this formulation. Although, on the plus side, it does leave a soft focus blurred tint even after the main colour fades out.

I was focused on work and had someone doing the cooking and feeding me. \n\nAnd then COVID happened and found mysef alone. \n\nIt\u2019s mid-July, and I can say this with confidence: I know how to cook now. \n\nNot perfect, but It\u2019s a progress. \n\nCheers to new #quarantineskills ! \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n(Next : Level up with more complex dishes!)\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#quarantinelifeskills #quarantinelife #shelterathome #lifeskills #learnsomethingnew #alwaysastudent #alwayslearning #alwayslearningalwaysgrowing #learningeveryday #cookingathome #quarantinecooking #lockdown2020 #lockdownlife #lockdowndiaries #lockdowndays","NumberOfLikes":40,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Lala Rimando | Writing | Yoga on July 20, 2020.","NumberOfComments":10,"Timestamp":1595296880,"LocalDate":"Tue Jul 21 04:01:20 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"How to start.... without my kid seeing it ... ? #painting #oilpastel #hobby #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":21,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Saumya Mathew on July 20, 2020.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1595296862,"LocalDate":"Tue Jul 21 04:01:02 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Photographer @charlie_chocolate_boyee @rewind_soulzzz_photography \nஔியில்லை ஒலியில்லை வாழ வழியில்லை\nமனதோடு கசியும் கசப்புகளும் புளித்துவிடும்\nஅன்பு என்பது கிடைக்கபெறுவது மட்டுமன்றி\nகொடுக்கப்படுவது ஆம்\n\nகண்துடைக்க கைகள் உள்ள போது \n மகிழ்விக்க மனம் உள்ள போது\nதுயர் என்பது தூசியைக்காட்டிலும் குறைந்தது.\n\nகனவுகளை நிறைவேற்ற கலக்கமில்லாமல் துணிந்தெழுவாய்\nசோகம் என்பது ஒருமுறை தான் \nஅதன் பிம்பங்களே நம்மை வாட்டிவிடும்\nவாழ்வும் ஒருமுறை தான் உன் மனவலிமை அதை காட்டிவிடு.\n\n☺️Tq for this photograph\n#monochrome #monochromatic #monochromephotography #loveframes #blackandwhitephotography #blackandwhitephoto #emotionsofwomen #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":80,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by jamuna on July 20, 2020 tagging @charlie_chocolate_boyee.

That we keep our phones and laptops away, forget our work and do fun activities together as a family ☺️.  The kids had begun to go to the park in our colony just a couple of weeks ago, but that has come to a pause again since the rain gods seem to have been working overtime for these past two weeks or so.  😕 so we could do that either.\nEvery time I run out of fun things to do, I fall back on @firstcryintelli 's summer camp ideas. Just like this super fun and easy art idea. All we needed were paints, forks and a earbud! And N decided that this was to be a family project, so we all joined in 😄.\n@firstcryintelli Is also a one stop channel where one can get answers to so many parenting related questions via their live series.
