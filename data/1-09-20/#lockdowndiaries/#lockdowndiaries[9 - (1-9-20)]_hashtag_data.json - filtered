No one knows. The title of official ice cream inventor has never been awarded. What we do know is, as far back as 200 B.C., people have enjoyed variations of frozen treats. Alexander the Great loved snow flavoured with honey and nectar, biblical references have been made to King Solomon\u2019s desire of iced drinks, and Nero Claudius Caesar was known to send servants to the mountains for snow to then be flavoured with fruits and juices. However, it is the Chinese who are most often credited with the invention of today\u2019s ice cream. They figured out that packing snow into a bowl of rice and milk made a tasty treat. Then a thousand years later, Marco Polo returned home from a trip to the Far East with a recipe similar to modern day sherbet. The craze quickly spread throughout Europe\u2019s upper class, and royalty during the 1500s.\n.\n.\n\nIndia, on the other hand, boasts of an impressive history of ice cream as well. In the sixteenth century, Mughal rulers were known to send relays of horsemen to collect and transport ice from Hindu Kush to Delhi, in order to make fruit sorbets. Kulfi, referred to as the \u201Ctraditional ice cream of India\u201D, also originated in the sixteenth century, during the Mughal reign.\n\nAt present, India stands as the world\u2019s fastest growing ice cream market. As per reports, the ice cream sales in India have increased by 13 per cent per year over the last 7 years.\n.\nHappy world Ice Cream day 🍦 \n.\n#icecream #chocolateicecream #almondicecream #roastedalmondicecream #lockdown #homemade  #homechef #chocolatealmondicecream #qurantinecooking #lockdowncooking #lockdowndiaries #chocolatesauce #yummy #yummyinthetummy #dessert #desserts #summertime #coolcoolicecream #worldicecreamday #happyworldicecreamday","NumberOfLikes":27,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by All things food in Delhi - NCR with @theterracekitchen.

A good two weeks of study holidays we'll get now!\" Those two weeks snowballed into a month, then two months, and now more than four! Think about that - we've spent a third of this year indoors, and I can speak for all of us when I say that I don't really see the light at the end of the tunnel.⠀\n⠀\nTime and tide wait for no man, and neither does college - we've all been breaking our backs over online classes and those inane assignments, and now we're going where no man has gone before (in the most sarcastic sense of the phrase) and we're writing - or, shall I say, being forced to write - our exams FROM HOME!⠀\n⠀\nImagine, a year ago, if someone told you - You can write your exams in the same place you eat, shit and sleep. We'd all have roflmao-ed big time - but I guess none of us share that sentiment now xD. Very very different times indeed.⠀\n⠀\nAnyway, as we're all at home engineering new ways to ace the exams, here I am posting for the first time in months - a photo I clicked and edited in March (believe it or not!). This beauty was a gift from my mom on my Sweet 16th, and the Tissot T-Race looks good in the outdoors with the golden light of the evening hours giving it a beautiful vibe!⠀\n⠀\nI have been clicking a lot in the lockdown, but haven't gotten the time to edit anything. Once I get back on the saddle, expect to see a lot more posts coming your way!⠀\n⠀\nUntil then, hasta la vista baby!⠀\n⠀\nShot on Fujifilm XA-5 (15-45 mm) ⠀\n⠀\n#tissot #watchphotography #coloursofindia #photooftheday #photographers_of_india #artofvisuals #productphotographer #goodshotz #lonelyplanetindia #cntgiveitashot #maibhisadakchap #ShotOnFujifilm #nustaharamkhor #goldenhour #nammakarnatakaphotographers #bangalorephotographers #fstoppers @artofvisuals #lockdowndiaries #coronacation #hypebeast #followforfollowback #goodshotz @tissot_official #watchaddict #watchoftheday #fujifilm_xseries #fujixa5 #nbanews @tissot.us #MyTissot⠀","NumberOfLikes":189,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Rithvik AR in Brigade Millenium.

Once lockdown imposed I was getting frustrated due to negative news all over media and the cases which were increasing, and then suddenly I realised why not invest my spare time in Gardening. Beleive me, gardening worked as a #meditation to me. You used to get your me time, and while gardening you can think about the different aspects of life, imagine and plan your upcoming life. It calms you down and bring positivity. \n\nAlso if you are helping your surrounding, then I think it is also good for your family too. I started with 2 plants. Now I have around 24. In which 8 are indoor plants and rest are outdoor. If someone asked what you have achieved by doing this in a rented house, then I'll say peace of mind and a hope of greener future. 🌿🍀🌲💚\n\n#greenery #peace #meditation #gardening #mentalhealth  #positivevibes","NumberOfLikes":41,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by SWAPNIL SRIVASTAVA on July 19, 2020.

Thinking of the Kebabs makes my mouth watery!! \nKebabs are one of the most delicious meals across the world. Kebabs have been originated from the Middle East and been commonly prepared in the whole sub-continent. Kebabs are also one of the famous meals in Turkish cuisines. \nKebabs are made from the mince of beef, lamb, mutton, chicken, or fish depending on your choice. \nKebab karahi and kebab masala both are very popular in Pakistan as well as in India. I have simplified the recipe using chapli kebab masala which has added an amazing taste and aroma. Using the kebab and gravy makes this meal an amazing combo. It can be eaten with Nan, with rice or chapati. If you taste with paratha, that would make its taste more impressive.

If you may have observed my profile, in most of my pictures I can be found serious. Only two or three pictures are there in which a thin and feeble arch on my face could be observed. I was never like that. As everything has reason, this has too. When I look myself in the mirror, the figure in the mirror world taunts me without saying, \"why so serious?\", and I, helpless, give no answer, because I know smile is a natural thing, and it couldn't be produced artificially or deliberately. People often, when see me serious-faced, suggest me to light up my face with a smile, and I feign a curve, which looks horrible, as though I have inserted two fingers at the ends of my lips and extended them upward, drawing an arc. I don't want to smile, even then I do it. I hurt myself . . . just for them, for their satisfaction. They act as if how much they care about me, but in reality they show-off that fake caring just to convince themselves that they are kind, even though they aren't. I have always done the thing which they wanted, not what I wanted. That's how my smile was snatched and disappeared; like genie. \nNow when I don't do what they say, they proclaim me an arrogant and selfish. They believe that self-love is a sign of arrogance and selfishness. That's the face of our society.\nIn this cruel world, which does not regret for ruining your childhood, no one is yours except your mother (probably father as well).\n\n#pravinpoetry #joker #hate #love #lockdowndiaries #motivationalquotes #sadquotes #lifelessons #hope #sacrifice #quotes #hindi #kind #honest #depression #mentalhealth #smile #happinessquotes #happylife #blacklivesmatter #mankind #universe #galaxy #marvel #poetry #inspiration #instapoetry #greatvibes #desire #death","NumberOfLikes":18,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Pravin Gupta on July 19, 2020.

In terms of training outdoors - yes, running was disrupted, had other plans too in my mind and they were all shut down. But training indoors was not too different for me. I have been training indoors for years now. Never been to a gym, never liked that gym culture in the first place. Always wanted something athletic, movement based, so opened one athletic centre in my basement only and built it over the years, and kept at it. But in the end for me in terms of personal growth this was just a different phase, not too difficult, in fact rewarding.\nInspite of the all the inconveniences that have been caused, here I am lauding the lockdown. But then thats what life is made of - tackling the disappointments, the set backs and carrying them on with you - in your mind - in your emotions and using them as a gift, as a blessing rather than a curse. Giving them a whole new, opposite meaning.\n\nWith this on going pandemic I have now started giving people virtual\nsessions. What i make people do at home is literally what I have done at my home, all my life and the foundation only got stronger during this whole time. I have only gained.\n\n#fitness #athleticwear #athlete #athleisure #athletes #athletictraining #athleticwear #fit #indiafitness #fitnessindia #india #fitindian #fitindiamovement #mumbai #mumbairunners #lockdown #lockdownstories #lockdown2020 #quarantine #quarantinelife #quarantinestories #lockdowndiaries #workout #workoutmotivation #workoutroutine","NumberOfLikes":226,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by CNL|SahilArora|Run|Fit|India on July 18, 2020.

Link in profile.\n\nThe fallen gateau is one I bake every year, only this year it seems to have gotten better! Indulgent in every possible way, deeply fudgy & earthy, with mild undertones of fresh plum. That ganache resting on top completed the luxury, while plums and cherries in season added a burst of freshness and colour. \n\nThis was one of my final recipes being tested for my cookbook, so please wait for it ♥. \n\nOn another note, I've announced my next food styling worshop, this one is focussed mostly on desserts. Food styling for me is intuitive and fuss free, something that often comes together in 15-20 minutes. Also, if you like what you see, I shoot only in natural light and barely post process.\n\nIf that's what you are looking for, come join me at my workshop. I'll share how to visualise and find your style, shooting in natural light, behind the scenes, using\/sourcing basic props and backgrounds, & plenty of easy hacks too. Also tips on content creation for social media and how to create visually more exciting images.\n \nThe workshop is for anyone who wants to take better food pictures with either the camera or cell phone. You can see some of the feedback from the earlier workshops under the 'online worshop' highlights.

The brothers joined paths in Thailand in 2015, where Estudio Cavernas was spontaneously established with the purpose of building sustainable architecture for displaced migrants from Burma. \n\nThe material palette in their projects follows the vernacular architecture of the context. The preference for handcrafted finishes sets a particular rhythm at the construction site; earth is pressed into bricks and rammed into walls, solid timber truss beams are assembled in situ with a minimal set of tools.

Garnished with a bit of coriander leaves, this tastes best when served hot with plain rice. \n\n#fish #fishdish #foodaddict #foodtherapy #lockdowndiaries #lockdowncooking #bengalifood #bengalicuisine #foodgram #foodgasm #cleaneating #instayum #instagood #chefmodeon #foodstagram #foodventures #foodphotography #foodbloggers #authenticeats #happytummy #nomnom #foodporn #foodforthought #foodism #foodcoma #foodforfoodies #foodcoma#kitchenchronicles #goodeats #goodvibes","NumberOfLikes":33,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by @__thecarbdashians__ on July 18, 2020 tagging @tanuka_b.

Use a thermometer to cook the meat to your liking\n3. Steamed veggies, baked potatoes, salad, mashed potatoes... are good sides with steak. \n4. Can be cooked in oven or in a pan.. But the grill is the way to go\n5. Let the steak rest for half of the cooking time before you eat it\n\nFun fact 🎁\nThe filet mignon is from the small end of the tenderloin area of the animal, which is non-weight bearing and not toughened by exercise, resulting in extremely tender meat.

In our individual lives and across the world. \n\nSome of us with privilege are finally waking up to it. Tentatively, but still, so.\n\nSome of us face our demons during lockdown - whether that\u2019s too much time with ourselves, our families or a resetting of identity as we grieve what is lost.\n\nSome of us had to focus on just waking up each day and continuing.\n\nLook at us, in all our ugliness and our beauty. How many of us, despite being afraid, reach for the opportunity to grow. Like plants leaning into sunshine. Like caterpillars into butterflies 🦋 \n\nIn all the chaos there can be pockets of growth and change, little sprouts of hope. Clarity and balance so we can make conscious change.\n\nWhere have you grown? What\u2019s different about you since this all began? I\u2019d love to know. I\u2019m much more committed to rituals of self-care than ever. It took a while to choose this path, but I love it now.\n\nIf you need more mental balance in the chaos, join me online with @tringyogastudio on Sunday (tomorrow) 7pm UK time for a FREE meditation - we will practice kirtan kriya for that clarity so you can take conscious choices in the whirlwind of the world today.

The wide expanse that opened out before the heights on which the Russian batteries stood guarding the bridge, was at times veiled by a diaphanous curtain of slanting rain, and then, suddenly spread out in the sunlight, far-distant objects could be clearly seen glittering as though freshly varnished. Down below, the little town could be seen with its white, red-roofed houses, its cathedral, and its bridge, on both sides of which streamed jostling masses of Russian troops. At the bend of the Danube, vessels, an island, and a castle with a park surrounded by the waters of the confluence of the Enns and the Danube, became visible, and the rocky left bank of the Danube covered with pine forests, with a mystic background of green tree-tops and bluish gorges. The turrets of a convent stood out beyond a wild virgin pine-forest, and far away on the other side of the Enns the enemy\u2019s horse patrols could be discerned.\"\nWar and Peace, Tolstoy.\n\n####\n\nPeace is ambiguous, peace is fleeting, peace is elusive.\nAmidst the chaos, I dared to start this epic (yeah, being highly optimistic, you say), and it's been a while. Things do not move. Planning is pointless, when your plan is not time's plan. So plan all you want but, things remain static. You try your best to find a seclusive moment, and just when you get the time, you realize - its not the chores or the people or the events that are distracting you, its rather you, yourself. No pressure, but that seems to be the crux of it.\n\nLong story short, I wanted to read, but wanted to sketch this beautifully narrated scene. Of course, what came to my mind is different than what I painted, but in either case, this was done. \n\nUsed two of the pigment pens (or whatever these are called), with my son's ink (looks like cobalt blue) and a pinch of burnt sienna, that I decided to include at the last moment.\n\n#peace #monochrome #monologue #tolstoy #warandpeace #danube #blue #burntsienna #2020 #artistsoninstagram #artlovers #lockdowndiaries #monochromestudies","NumberOfLikes":142,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":16,"Timestamp":1595049334,"LocalDate":"Sat Jul 18 07:15:34 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"😅😅\n.\n.\n#coronamemes #corona #coronavirus #coronavirusmemes #lockdown #lockdownmemes #lockdowndiaries #lockdown2020 #lockdownmeme #COVID19 #covid #covid_19 #covid19 #sarcasticmemes #sarcasmmemes #sarcastc_us #epicfail #funnymemes😂 #funcontent #funnymemes #viralpost #trending #trendingnow","NumberOfLikes":21925,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by SARCASM on July 17, 2020.

We have been pushed to the edges of our finances, emotions, and patience.\n\nWe have also collectively lost the plot every now and then - I definitely have!\n\nIn the last 4 months I have been supporting survivors battling #domesticabuse within #lockdown 🗣✨ This has become a large (and developing) part of the work of Living Liberté.\n\nI have also been developing some \u2018mental healthy\u2019 e-books 💥✨ which will be on sale (excitingly!) very soon on the website. All profits will fund the voluntary mentoring aspect of LL.\n\nSchool relationship workshop plans 📚✨ are on hold for now, but I\u2019m excited to launch that aspect of LL when the right time comes along.\n\nAway from work, I was very fortunate to be find a way to reunite with my partner Rich, which I know is a privilege. I\u2019m very, very  grateful for this - and him. 💖✨ I think our #reunion faces here tell the story!\n\nI have also been battling my own challenges ✨ #anxiety has popped back up in my life quite a bit. It\u2019s been joined by poor (skewed) body confidence, which is a typical reaction for me when I\u2019m triggered.\n\nNewsflash! 💥 NONE of us have everything worked out. We don\u2019t know what the future holds. We are ALL working everything out as we go along. You don\u2019t have to do everything on your own, or feel alone in how you\u2019re feeling.\n\nI will wrap up this mini blog with saying that I believe in YOU 😌🌈 Wherever you are reading this right now and however you\u2019re feeling - you\u2019ve got THIS.\n\nYou don\u2019t need a highlight reel or a success story to prove your worth, so let it all go 😌✨ I\u2019ve never felt better for doing so these last few months.\n\nThere\u2019s so much to look forward to ✨ despite what the news is trying to tell us. Big positive change is happening amongst the chaos - keep (dancing) forwards wherever and however you can.\n\nSee you out there! 😌🌈✨ #liberté\n__________________________________________\n#lockdownstories #lockdownanxiety #lockdownmentalhealth #lockdownlove #lockdownwomen #lockdownstory #lockdowndiaries #lockdownchallenges #lockdownuk #lockdownlife #lockdownideas #lockdownpositivity","NumberOfLikes":102,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":11,"Timestamp":1595021348,"LocalDate":"Fri Jul 17 23:29:08 CEST 2020","Location":"Reading, England"},{"CaptionText":"Day 117!

Block play stimulates learning in all domains of development, intellectual, physical, and social-emotional and language. \n\nThe current research shows that block play is fundamental for later cognitive success for learning math and numbers. In a research study, it is proved that children who play with blocks when they are 3, 4 and 5 years of age will do better in math, especially Algebra in middle school.\n\nThere is a natural progression of block play and introducing infants and toddlers to block play is invaluable. \n\nRead about this progression here http:\/\/mylittlebookshop.in\/importance-of-playing-with-wooden-blocks\/\n\n#lockdowndiaries #playalongmummies #letthemplay #encouragefreeplay #slowdownmama #mommyinfluencer #waldorfinfluence #waldorftoystore #waldorfindia #toystagram #chooseecofriendly #waldorfhomeschool #homeschoolduringpandemic #kindergartenhomeschool #bangalorehomeschoolers #plasticfreejuly #saynotoworksheets","NumberOfLikes":38,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1595003791,"LocalDate":"Fri Jul 17 18:36:31 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Been a while.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#LockdownDiaries #HouseArrest #PooBaniParvati","NumberOfLikes":149,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by P O O J A on July 17, 2020.

Whatever you choose to do, hope it\u2019s a good one 🤗.\n\n#Fridayfeeling\n#enjoythelittlethings \n#makeitcount \n#cornwallmemories \n#makingmemories❤️ \n#cornwall\n#wearamask😷 \n#besafeeveryone🙏 \n#familytime \n#campingincornwall \n#campinglife \n#leavingealing \n#ealingmum\n#londonmum\n#mumlife \n#ealingmumlife \n#lockdowndiaries \n#staycation2020 \n#coastalwalk \n#cornwallcoast \n#fridaymood \n#fridaymotivation \n#fridaymorning\n#familyiseverything \n#weekendtrip\n#weekendgetaway \n#lastdayofterm \n#schoolsoutforsummer \n#schoolisout \n#summerbreak2020","NumberOfLikes":72,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":17,"Timestamp":1594968989,"LocalDate":"Fri Jul 17 08:56:29 CEST 2020","Location":"Lansallos Beach"},{"CaptionText":"This video I made around 2 weeks ago and that time I hadn't started uploading videos here..I was shy and I always had fear facing camera..so I was trying making videos on a daily basis to get rid of fear..so the reason of uploading this video is because of the TOPIC.

It is sometimes chanted as three sounds, a-u-m, symbolic of the three major Hindu deities: Bhrahma Shakti (creation), Vishnu Shakti (preservation) and Shiva Shakti (liberation, and\/or destruction).\nOM is the highest sacred symbol in Hinduism. The word OM is so much powerful that this single word can produce powerful and positive vibrations which allows you to feel the whole universe. ... OM is the mantra which cleanse our Aura and also related to the third eye chakra also known as (BROW CHAKRA).\nWhen chanted Om vibrates at the frequency of 432 Hz \u2013 the same vibrational frequency found in all things throughout nature. Om is the basic sound of the universe; chanting it symbolically and physically tunes us into that sound and acknowledges our connection to everything in the world and the Universe.\n\nHere are the Health Benefits of Om Chanting :\n\n🕉️Helps to Improve Concentration\n🕉️Reduces Stress and Anxiety\n🕉️ Rejuvenating & Pacifying\n🕉️Gives Strength to Spinal Cord.\n🕉️Detoxifies Blood\n🕉️Improves Functioning of Heart & Digestive System\n🕉️Ensures Sound Sleep \n🕉️Makes You Emotionally Stable.\n.\n.\n.\n#yoga #omchanting #healthbenefits #mom#hindumom #karnatakamombloggers #indianmomblogger #indianculture #bangaloremoms #bangaloremombloggers #bangaloremomblogger #bangaloreblogger #harit #yadvi #shivanilife #mom4ind #kidsofinstagram #likefatherlikeson #lockdown2020 #lockdowndiaries #picoftheday#greatmomsindia","NumberOfLikes":98,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":56,"Timestamp":1594921867,"LocalDate":"Thu Jul 16 19:51:07 CEST 2020","Location":"Jyothi Nagar"},{"CaptionText":"Are you #missing it?\nThen you are a real #foody #category😋#lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":103,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Aboli Halwe on July 16, 2020 tagging @5.minit.recipe.
