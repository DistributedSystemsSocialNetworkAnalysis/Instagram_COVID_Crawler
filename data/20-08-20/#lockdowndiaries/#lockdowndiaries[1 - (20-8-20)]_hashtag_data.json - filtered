With elderly parents & a child under nine months, I felt helpless in not being some kind of human shield so they can remain unharmed. Though seeing all the suffering around, I am achingly aware of my own privilege. There seems to be a strange relationship with time. It feels more visceral than ever before but also blurred, with days merging into each other. Most of all, there is a sense of losing time.\n\nAs a response to what was happening around me & within, I started creating digital collages, one every day for about 15 days almost like traversing the stages of grief \u2013 & unwittingly the sense, mood & state of mind somewhere started to shift. These collages became an articulation of my own process of healing, both practice & an approach. What started with denial, & an awareness of the fragility of reality began to steer towards surrender- a sort of acceptance of the uncertainty. It has been difficult to let go of control but that is something I have just started to sit with & not be so afraid of. \n\nHowever na�ve it might seem right now, eventually, I\u2019d like to reach a point of hope, something that Neil Gaiman writes so beautifully about:\n\u201CThere are so many fragile things\u2026Stories, like people & butterflies & songbirds' eggs & human hearts & dreams, are also fragile things, made up of nothing stronger or more lasting than twenty-six letters & a handful of punctuation marks. Or they are words on the air, composed of sounds & ideas-abstract, invisible, gone once they've been spoken - & what could be more frail than that? But some stories, small, simple ones about setting out on adventures or people doing wonders, tales of miracles & monsters, have outlasted all the people who told them, & some of them have outlasted the lands in which they were created.\u201D \n\u201COur stories will outlive us.\u201D\n\n@vasuvious is a self-trained digital artist.

He chooses to be a sheepdog and signs up to become a Navy SEAL. He meets and marries Taya (#SiennaMiller), and after the 9\/11 attacks, he's sent to Iraq. His mission is to protect his fellow SEALs, but his skill with a rifle is so awesome that he eventually breaks the record for the most confirmed kills in military history. Chris goes on to become a legend in Iraq and keeps signing up for more tours of duty, much to the despair of Taya and their children. When Chris finally decides to come home for good, he finds he can't get the war out of his head -- until he discovers that helping other veterans and victims of PTSD brings him solace.\n______________________________\nTotally, It's a perfect balance - - The meaty action is show in a way you can always see what is happening, something unusual and refreshing in modern films. Although it's a true story, so you might think easy to tell, it takes an artist to tell it in a way that you are by his side throughout the film. It's not made to be over the top, blow your mind entertainment, it's much deeper. It sets out to share the life of a very unique man in a thoroughly entertaining way,Apart From Minor Flaws The Flim Lifts Off - - a recommended watch. \n\nRead more reviews @movieshut_\n______________________________","NumberOfLikes":264,"Hashtags":["#AmericanSniper","#BradleyCooper)","#SiennaMiller),"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @movieshut_ on August 20, 2020.

Kay here. So I'm a full-time student and I'd like to share a realisation I had recently. \n\nFor the past two days I've been struggling to buckle down and get stuck in to my assignments. I get ready, but then I get hit with an overwhelming sense of fear, almost dread.\n\nSince lockdown, meditation has been my therapy ?? So yesterday I realized that part of the fear feeling was loneliness, a sense of wanting someone to support me with love and affection. There was also a sense of emptiness.\n\nToday I could sense a lack of courage. The fear gets so intense that all courage flees. So this morning I focused on the words 'May I allow myself to feel courage'. Those words helped and I hope it carries me through the day so that I actually get some work done.\n\nThese past two days have taught me to not just sit in that fear state and cycle through those same thinking patterns of fear and then resorting to distractions. But to rather become deeply aware of what is really going on. Face it it head on, give those feelings room to be. If I never deal with them they'll always come back.\n\nCurrent strategy: go outside, meditate, become aware of what is really going on, ask yourself what you need, practice self care and patience. Repeat.\n\n#maturestudent #studentlife #studying #workfromhome #college #collegelife #collegedayinmylife #universitylife #studystruggles #studyhacks #lifehacks #notsponsored #lockdowndiaries  #lockdownstudy #lockdownsurvivalkit #realisations #meditation #selfcaretip #everythingstudent #studentthings #studentthangs #studiesonlockdown #assignmentsduringlockdown","NumberOfLikes":0,"Hashtags":["#maturestudent","#studentlife","#studying","#workfromhome","#college","#collegelife","#collegedayinmylife","#universitylife","#studystruggles","#studyhacks","#lifehacks","#notsponsored","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdownstudy","#lockdownsurvivalkit","#realisations","#meditation","#selfcaretip","#everythingstudent","#studentthings","#studentthangs","#studiesonlockdown","#assignmentsduringlockdown"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Nova & Echo on August 19, 2020.

In that sense, the lockdown has been a blessing, allowing me to express myself in a different way (for what is art if not a form of expression?). It has also served as a steady reminder, that I am more than the words I speak\/write. And so, despite well-meaning and sardonic comments alike on how I\u2019ve been \u201Ccooking a lot these days,\u201D I keep going on, simply because it is another conduit for the imaginings and imaginations within me. Using leftover crispy smashed potatoes from last night\u2019s dinner as the base for a quick papeta par edu-like dish for lunch, kind of gives me the same joy I would derive from restructuring a sentence to make more sense, or express better the things I am trying to say.

Now restrictions have been lifted, the pre-recorded weekly Zoom interviews are designed to provide insight into how our community of survivors are managing in the pandemic as a whole. A clip of each already posted to the DS channels is also posted to our feed to briefly introduce our wonderful Instagram audience and to give everyone a taster of personal affiliation with each survivor!\n\nLockdown interview number fourteen features stroke survivors Sheelagh and Andrew. Sheelagh is our Administrator at Different Strokes. She had her stroke in 2018 at the age of 51. Andrew had 3 haemorrhagic strokes in 2000 aged just 21. He takes us back to the start and through the progress he\u2019s made learning to walk and talk again, along with his aspirations and a heartwarming story how his goal was to get on one knee to propose to his now wife. He talks about the different types of brain injury he saw in rehab; the activities, treatments and physio he endured in his time there and the problems that have evolved because of his strokes - such as visual issues, epilepsy which is now controlled, fatigue and a permanent loss of feeling and movement in his arm. He discusses his struggles with Aphasia, reading and writing, how that affected his self assurance and relationships, and he explains about how casual talk with people was the best therapy. \n\nAndrew works in a school at lunchtime and continued this with key worker\u2019s kids during lockdown. He chats about juggling both work and the hard task of helping his own children with schoolwork from home and how his family teamed up to help. They both speak about holidays during a pandemic and the volatility of current times. He also mentions how he\u2019s started to mingle back into socially distanced life. \n\n Catch the full interview at:\n? https:\/\/differentstrokes.co.uk\/stroke-survivor-experiences-during-lockdown\/\n?? https:\/\/youtu.be\/nNBMW414umk\n?? https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/differentstrokescharity\/","NumberOfLikes":16,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597834748,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 19 12:59:08 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"jasraj_manga","CaptionText":"Imitation is the best form of flattery!\n\n@naveen.polishetty would agree!\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n@pranitharaj \n@anwar18_ali\n@harshajella \n\n#unheardlyrics#misheardlyrics#teluguhumour#telugutiktok#hyderabadi#tollywood#badsinging#spoof#lockdowndiaries#justforfun#daysofourlives#artistsupport#madeuplyricsarebetter#bollywoodsinging#funnylyrics#improv#jasrajmanga#viralvideos#trending#comedyvideos#nuff","NumberOfLikes":49,"Hashtags":["#unheardlyric","#misheardlyric","#teluguhumou","#telugutikto","#hyderabad","#tollywoo","#badsingin","#spoo","#lockdowndiarie","#justforfu","#daysofourlive","#artistsuppor","#madeuplyricsarebette","#bollywoodsingin","#funnylyric","#impro","#jasrajmang","#viralvideo","#trendin","#comedyvideo","#nuff"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":12,"Timestamp":1597834734,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 19 12:58:54 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"anmbhele","CaptionText":"#day3betterme\n\nI have had so much going on in my mind.

I want to remind myself of all the hurdles I\u2019ve overcome and the wins (both small & large) that I\u2019ve had during this time. As someone with chronic ill health, my battles are daily, and yet I will always jump (or crawl if needs be) to an opportunity to uplift myself, and in turn, others. My #wearyourhappy mantra was borne of a necessity to create, to reflect and to stubbornly hold onto who I was despite such gruelling and life altering illness and treatment regime. And whilst I am not cured, I am truly at peace within myself and hope that even the smallest of smiles appears on your face seeing me embrace life with a little fun & colour, in direct defiance of the troubles both near and far. Today I wore purple eyeshadow and embraced my wild hair & colourful ensemble to face the world. It helped. A lot. I\u2019ve learned it\u2019s perfectly ok to voice what you need to not only survive, but to thrive. And it\u2019s not just ok, it\u2019s a necessity to honour yourself first and fore most. Not only will it become a life long habit, it will also teach others how you need to be treated. We all want to be seen & accepted. And if you don\u2019t- it\u2019s because you\u2019re yet to accept yourself. That\u2019s at the heart of it. Pure, indulgent, life-giving self love.
