Until the past week or so I really couldn\u2019t find balance throughout lockdown. As a hyper sensitive empath the hurt and death of other people hangs around me, the not knowing and not being able to do things I love makes me feel flat. The fact I\u2019ve lost so much weight and muscle from lack of my beloved barbells makes me almost angry after working so hard.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t have the added worry of being vulnerable, being Black and\/or Disabled (and therefore more likely to suffer from C19), I\u2019m not at risk of losing my job and if I did I\u2019d have the funds to secure us for a while. I have a supportive partner and access to free healthcare. \n\nThat\u2019s not to say my problems should be compared. I think we often miss the point when we think of other peoples suffering in comparison it to our own. Every single persons varying struggles are valid. But if we fail to acknowledge that of others too then we fail those people.\n\nLet\u2019s do better to consider ourselves and the people around us, even though restrictions are lifting around the world, millions of people are still at risk. \n\nLet me know some good things you\u2019ve been up to during lockdown? \n___\nAlt text: a white arm wearing a silver bangle reaches the flowing leaves of a Willow tree.","NumberOfLikes":49,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"a white hand wearing a silver bangle reaches the flowing leaves of a Willow tree.","NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1595881418,"LocalDate":"Mon Jul 27 22:23:38 CEST 2020","Location":"Islington"},{"CaptionText":"Kudos to #rhythmwinery for their #delicious Alphonso #sangria #recipe\n\nWe #mixed #alophonsomango #wine with sugar syrup , #vodka , #kesar and #alphonso #mango pieces and topped it with sparkling water\n?.\n?.\n?.\n?.\n#lipsmacking #tropical #tropicalsangria #mangoes #mangowine #cocktails #summercocktails #afternooncocktails #cocktail #winelovers #mangolovers #winestagram #sangriasundays #sundayfunday #quarantineandchill #lockdowndiaries #weekendfun #drinkoftheday #mixology","NumberOfLikes":40,"Hashtags":["#rhythmwinery","#delicious","#sangria","#recipe","#mixed","#alophonsomango","#wine","#vodka","#kesar","#alphonso","#mango","#lipsmacking","#tropical","#tropicalsangria","#mangoes","#mangowine","#cocktails","#summercocktails","#afternooncocktails","#cocktail","#winelovers","#mangolovers","#winestagram","#sangriasundays","#sundayfunday","#quarantineandchill","#lockdowndiaries","#weekendfun","#drinkoftheday","#mixology"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by SK & PK #globaltummies in London, United Kingdom with @rhythm_winery, @viruvalgevodka, and @redrickshawfood.

I do! But luckily I haven\u2019t had to spend over �600 each month & 4 hours each day travelling. Thanks lockdown! \nBut it turns out I\u2019m a fair chunk down. So, what happened?\n.\nThe extra time at home ? has meant Ive had more energy to focus on me, my brand & my dreams. And Ive had the opportunity to invest in myself & my future! Yes it has been quite a chunk of money with no return right now\u2026\n.\nBut it has seriously been one of THE BEST THINGS I have done!!?\n.\nThe thoughts of spending that much money on me was terrifying. It really scared me. But oh my god has it been worth it. To actually take the time & just think about what I want & need to reach my goals, & making those first steps towards it is really, really empowering.\n.\nIm always that person who will give all their time to help & support others, share advice - I always will do - but I seriously beat myself up & tear myself down. I can never take my own advice or think about what I want - something that I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not alone in feeling.\n.\nBut the coaching programs I have invested in are giving me not just the tools & knowledge but the confidence & belief that I can achieve my dreams. Thanks again Prasha and Holly. And I am in the mindset that the physical items I have been able to buy are not just things, but an investment in my future.\n.\nI recognise that Im in a very privileged position to be able to do this, especially during lockdown, and invest financially. But I would strongly encourage every single one of you to invest in yourself before the year is out - financially or with your time! These investments also don\u2019t need to be business related. Think careers, relationships, health & more.\n.\nHere are some ways that you could do that:\n? Explore professional development at work\n?Pair up & swap skills with someone. Teach each other!\n? Sign up to a course\n? Invest in your health & meditate, journal or walk daily\n? Find free resources online to support you\n? Catch up with an old friend\n?

Only weeks after the U.K. included Spain on a list of countries safe for summer holidays, the government reversed course and announced late Saturday it would impose a 14-day quarantine on anyone arriving from Spain. The move came after cases in the country jumped, particularly in the Catalonia region, where authorities are racing to stamp out new outbreaks. Norway on Friday announced a 10-day quarantine for people returning from Spain, and France issued new travel warnings for the Catalonia region, which is home to Barcelona and popular beaches. The moves will further weigh on bookings in the peak travel period for a country that depends on tourism for more than 10% of gross domestic product. Spain\u2019s health ministry reported more than 920 new cases on both Thursday and Friday, the highest numbers since early May, when the government began easing one of Europe\u2019s strictest lockdowns.\n.\n.\nDo follow and share @the_recent.column for latest updates.\n.\n.\n#spain #spainstagram #spaingram #instaspain #recentnews #recentcolumn #worldgram #worldnewsdaily #worldnews #europe #european #pandemic2020 #covid19 #covidnews #florida #norway #barcelonaspain #barcelona #france #uk #french #catalonia #cataloniaroyaltulum #lockdown #lockdown2020 #lockdownlife #lockdowndiaries #tourism #spain_photographs #spain_passion","NumberOfLikes":9,"Hashtags":["#spain","#spainstagram","#spaingram","#instaspain","#recentnews","#recentcolumn","#worldgram","#worldnewsdaily","#worldnews","#europe","#european","#pandemic2020","#covid19","#covidnews","#florida","#norway","#barcelonaspain","#barcelona","#france","#uk","#french","#catalonia","#cataloniaroyaltulum","#lockdown","#lockdown2020","#lockdownlife","#lockdowndiaries","#tourism","#spain_photographs","#spain_passion"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The_Recent.Column on July 26, 2020.

Madhavrao Peshwa built this fort on the borders of the empire and handed over the control of the fort to Patwardhan family of Sangli who later transferred it to Mudholkar Ghorpade. A trench has been built surrounding the fort and is now covered with vegetation. A part of the trench opposite the entrance has been filled to make a road in-way. The two bastions alongside the entrance have been refurbished.�The fort has two fortification walls. The outer wall has 18 bastions while the inner one has 8 bastions. The 12 ft base of fortified walls and bastions are built of black rock and the upper remaining part is made of bricks. As we enter the citadel from the inner fortified wall there is a dense vegetation cover and many structural remains have been hidden in here. There is step well.

Here's her 'lockdown' story:\n\nMy baby and I sitting in the balcony watching the sunset along the horizons of the Periyar river where boats paddle across its streams, is our usual evening. In the initial days of the lockdown, I was hopeful that everything will soon get back to normal. But my hopes were crushed by mid-April when Covid cases in India started spiking. \nMy husband - a navigational officer, left to sail months ago knowing that he would miss our baby\u2019s little milestones, with hopes of reuniting with us by mid-July. I was eagerly waiting for him to return at least by the time she starts walking. But it sure looks like he is going to miss that too as the sailors could only reach back home when the international flight operations resume. As the wait for this global stand-still to end continues - I miss him. It pains me to see our baby play every day without even realizing she has a father who on the other side is sailing the oceans, eagerly waiting to come home to her. I constantly realized how important it is to not take what you have for granted as for us, spending time together as a family seemed a luxury. It has been almost three months since we went out or had any visitors. Friends and family stayed away in concern of the baby. But now I am perturbed as she is starting to show stranger-anxiety at the mere sight of people passing by. \nThis lockdown helped me immensely in changing the way I perceived the world. I learnt it takes just a microbe to bring us humans to our knees and discovered the power of nature to restore itself. People who never once slowed down in their lives are taking a break. These days my husband and I, though shores apart, are co-writing an autobiographical fiction and we are looking forward to get it published by the end of this year. My baby and I still wait here looking forward to little things like these which means the world to us. After all, this is what hope is all about, isn\u2019t it?\n\n@anjoalphonse #journal_hope #hope #love #stayhome  #change #survival #pandemic  #family #baby #parents #sailing #lockdowndiaries #instagood #quarantine","NumberOfLikes":24,"Hashtags":["#journal_hope","#hope","#love","#stayhome","#change","#survival","#pandemic","#family","#baby","#parents","#sailing","#lockdowndiaries","#instagood","#quarantine"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1595737358,"LocalDate":"Sun Jul 26 06:22:38 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Milky eyes \n#lockdowndiaries #nikondslr #quarantineandchill #lockdowninspiration #photography2020","NumberOfLikes":9,"Hashtags":["#lockdowndiaries","#nikondslr","#quarantineandchill","#lockdowninspiration","#photography2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Ostrich.nuts.mist on July 25, 2020.

Who is stopping me? Not me anymore!\n\nOver the last few weeks being back at work I\u2019ve have had many women come up to me either telling me I look amazing in what I\u2019m wearing or asking where I got whatever I\u2019m wearing that day (normally newlook,working there I get amazing discount ??) \nI have to say every time it truly makes my day, I\u2019m no fashionista at all! Just a simple mind change has had this effect , I had no amazing lockdown transformation just change of mind set. And Just because I work in fashion retail dose not me I have a clue about fashion either ??\u200D??\nSo it\u2019s amazes in the first place I got a compliment ? it\u2019s what follows after that shocks me though, they normally go on to say \u201Cl don\u2019t have the confidence to wear that, I\u2019m to big\u201D or \u201Cyour curves are in the right places mine ain\u2019t so I can\u2019t wear that\u201D the fact someone who has just made my day by complimenting me feels like that is sad. It\u2019s sad how we all compare our selfs to others these days when we will forever and always all be so different. \nWe should all feel like we can wear what we want, when we want.\nnot to feel we can\u2019t wear it because we\u2019re to big,to thin, to many curves or not enough curves , to short, to tall etc. Don\u2019t get me wrong it\u2019s so easy to fall in to that mind set but we should try our hardest not to. \nAfter these women complimenting me,I\u2019ve taken it upon myself to do the same, pay it forward if you like cos I want every women to experience that feeling I do when a stranger comes and gives me a compliment because it\u2019s amazing! #realtalk #thisisme #selfcare #thisisnewlook #midsizestyle #loveurcurves #curves #payitforward #jumpsuit #curveygirls #redhair #loveyourself #startsomethingnew #newlook #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":48,"Hashtags":["#realtalk","#thisisme","#selfcare","#thisisnewlook","#midsizestyle","#loveurcurves","#curves","#payitforward","#jumpsuit","#curveygirls","#redhair","#loveyourself","#startsomethingnew","#newlook","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Maddi | Midsize style | Disney in Love Yourself with @newlook.
