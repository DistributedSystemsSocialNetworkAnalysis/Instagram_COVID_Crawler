I havent written any poems, done any crafts or written opinion articles. It\u2019s not that I havent tried. I have. But my \u201Ccreative juices\u201D ?have been wrung dry. \n.\nThis #lockdown has given us free time , perhaps too much free time. ? Time that I otherwise would have been spent studying, at university or out with my friend. Now I had all this free time, it was a little overwhelming.  Having intensely focused on filling the gaps in my days with something creative, it made that time feel more obligatory than inspired. \n.\nSoon enough I realised that I did not have to conquer the world in one day. So I decided to stop trying to cram everything into 24hours and instead take time to focus on me and engage in creative and mind freeing activities when it felt necessary. As my mum says : \u201Ctoo much of anything is never good for you\u201D\n.\nDuring this time I allowed myself to detach from the moment and focus on me. An activity which helped me a lot with this was #yoga ??\u200D?? ( not the intense flexible yoga, more of the sit on the floor and listen to calming music one ). It helped me to be more mindful and selfaware and it is something I highly recommend to others. Even if it\u2019s just for a few minutes in the morning, trust me it really helps ! \n. \nPS .

It is important to speak out loud. Before anything, we are an individuals who must have knowledge to fight for their own rights. One of the most obnoxious is the domestic violence. I don't know why people afraid of speaking about this. Just for the sake of so called \"Chaar Log\". No, they don't matter more than you. Afraid of how society will treat. It's important to talk. Talk about anything bad happening with you. If someone try to keep your mouth shut with popular sayings like \"Arre Har Ghar Me Aisa Hota Hai\" That's where the problem began. \"AGAR AISA HOTA HAI, TO NAHI HONA CHAHIYE\". One more important thing to talk about is violence or mental health of boys. There are lots of cases when domestic violence happened with boys. But they afraid to talk about because of so called society norms of toxic masculinity. There is nothing wrong if you cry in public.\n \"Tmhare mardangi me koi aanch nhi aayegi\"\nThere are lots of cases when no FIR drafted for the molestation or Brutality on boys. It is important to bring all those things in notice now. Its time to normalize a girl being tough and a guy being soft. There is nothing bad in that. Bad situation arises when you play with someone's emotions,  bully someone, becoming reason for someone's mental trauma. Let me ask you one question:\nThose so called masculinity flag bearers who molest a guy because of their sexuality or any possible cause. Don't you think they are not aware of their own sexuality??

Many cheeses use animal rennet, which is tough to navigate or at times, even find out about. This little cheese store in Oxford was especially useful in that regard, with its clearly labelled vegetarian cheeses. \nDespite their other famed gastronomic foibles, the English do cheese superbly well (there really is no greater joy in the cheese world than a sharp mature cheddar oozing out of a grilled cheese sandwich, I feel!). \nThe friendly store owner would patiently guide me through cheese tasting sessions of his 4 vegetarian cheeses, my favourite of which was a creamy and smelly blue cheese, quite similar to the famous English Stilton. Fortnightly visits to the store to get this delicious blue cheese left me with a lighter purse, a happier heart, and an expanded waistline. \n\n#cheese #englishcheese #englishfood #TVBFinEngland #foodlust #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":16,"Hashtags":["#cheese","#englishcheese","#englishfood","#TVBFinEngland","#foodlust","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Aditi Chatterjee in Oxford, Oxfordshire.

The Coronavirus pandemic and the lockdown is making me miss things, people and activities that I never thought I would. One of them is taking a metro ride.\n\nOn a regular day, I would spend at least 2 hours in a metro. I have traveled at different hours and each ride brings out a different kind of emotion.\n\nThe morning ride to work usually irritates me and I prefer staying quiet. There are days when the smell of the sweat of people, someone's hands brushing your hands (intentionally or unintentionally), people boarding the train when even it is already full, people having a political debate at the top of their voice and other such incidents agitate me. Hence, I prefer parking myself at a safe spot and get lost in my own world.\n\nBut it's not like I hate travelling in a metro. I usually prefer early morning or late night (off peak hours) metro rides because one gets a seat.\n\nEarly morning rides are usually fun as one gets to see interesting activities. Like, once I saw an uncle polishing his shoes.\n\nTo me, late night rides are meant for relaxing. One can easily take more than one seat and stretch out. The picture is from one such ride. I saw a girl sitting across me, stretching her legs on four seats and sleeping. I decided to take some inspiration and get into my comfort zone - sitting with folded legs.\n\nNow, I'm having this urge to step out of the house, take a rickshaw to the nearest metro station, run straight to the platform to board 8.44 am wali metro and hope to catch office shuttle on time. Those were the days!\n\nP.S. - This post is inspired from @jayashreesahithya 's post on auto rides.","NumberOfLikes":20,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Aastha Ahuja on July 23, 2020.

In one part, there is a tower of the telecommunications department and in the rest are the remains of the fort. On the left hand side in front of the door you can see many old buildings. It has two temples. The first temple has a Shivling with an idol of Bhairava behind it.

One of these wells is filled with trees, while the other is in use. You see the old castle next to the telecom department office.

But it's absolutely optional.??\n.\n.\nFollow @food__trek for more such home cooked dishes.\n.\n.\n#palakpaneer #punjabicuisine #northindian #paranthewaligali  #lockdowndiaries #lockdowncooking #homecookedmeal #foodporn #foodstagram #foodie #foodblogger #instafood #kolkatadiaries #kolkata_igers #igdaily #ig_kolkata #igers #calcuttadiaries #foodgasm #loveforcooking #foodtalkindia #indianfoodie #loveforfood #igdaily #gastronomic #foodaholic #garammasala #buzzfeedfood #buzzfeedtasty #nomnommedank","NumberOfLikes":194,"Hashtags":["#palakpaneer","#punjabicuisine","#northindian","#paranthewaligali","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdowncooking","#homecookedmeal","#foodporn","#foodstagram","#foodie","#foodblogger","#instafood","#kolkatadiaries","#kolkata_igers","#igdaily","#ig_kolkata","#igers","#calcuttadiaries","#foodgasm","#loveforcooking","#foodtalkindia","#indianfoodie","#loveforfood","#igdaily","#gastronomic","#foodaholic","#garammasala","#buzzfeedfood","#buzzfeedtasty","#nomnommedank"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by FoodTrek on July 23, 2020.

Here's my story ?\nInitially, the idea of working from a space at the 'life' end of work-life balance really threw me off. Add to that 'noise' - not just literal sounds but also an endless chatter inside my head. My old, self-doubting narrative kept questioning me: \"Meher, how will you manage this?\" Blah, blah, blah.\n?\nTranscending my narrative has involved years of conscious efforts to build a structured routine with consistent places and times for different activities. And then all of those things were meshed into mush when #covid19quarantine happened. How could I work in the space I sleep in? It confused me to outer space! ?\n?\nEarly this year, I turned to #meditation. My #selfawareness began to evolve. I realised that I had let my narrative, my set of #limitingbeliefs, have the power to control me. It'd tell me I couldn't when I could, and shouldn't when I should. That's just mean! \n?\nI then began to observe myself from a place of unconfounded awareness as thoughts took a backseat. I realised it was not about work at all. It was about my own outlook on life.\n?\nI embraced a life of #mindfulliving, #gratitude and #selflove. The work-life 'mush' didn't seem so messy anymore. Place wasn't the concern. Timing was. And with that, my 'new' workspace gradually became 'normal' for me... among manyyy other transformations ???\n\n#thenewnormal #selfbeliefs #reflections #mindsetshifts #positivethought #changeyourlife #stayathome #fightcovid19together #lockdowndiaries #quarantine2020 #mentalwellness #mentalhealth #healthandwellness #wellness #wellnessblogger #pakistaniwellnessblogger #mindfulliving #mindfulness #mindfullymeher","NumberOfLikes":32,"Hashtags":["#workingfromhome","#covid19quarantine","#meditation.","#selfawareness","#limitingbeliefs,","#mindfulliving,","#gratitude","#selflove.","#thenewnormal","#selfbeliefs","#reflections","#mindsetshifts","#positivethought","#changeyourlife","#stayathome","#fightcovid19together","#lockdowndiaries","#quarantine2020","#mentalwellness","#mentalhealth","#healthandwellness","#wellness","#wellnessblogger","#pakistaniwellnessblogger","#mindfulliving","#mindfulness","#mindfullymeher"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by | Mindfully M.E.H.E.R | in Karachi, Pakistan.
