Do go through and enroll for the course now.\n\n#somepositivity\n\nIt all started in the month of march, it was somewhere in the world, but not yet here. At the end of the month we were still thinking it's a matter of just one lockdown and the life will soon go back to normal. At the end of April there were already increasing cases and more lockdowns. At the end of may we were hoping to start a life with new normalcy in few months. The month of june was full of 'depressing' news along with pandemic. And in july it seems that it's everywhere, coming near you each day, more cases of losing near and dear ones, people you knew tested positive and there is uncertainty everywhere!\n\nHowever we completed yesterday a super intensive course and I must say, it was full of positivity. We forgot all the worries for at least four hours every day. A huge applause to all my students, who co-operated, supported and enjoyed the whole new atmosphere of online class. A big thank you to all students for understanding and accepting this difficult situation and this sweet gesture! It means a lot to me.\n\nAll I can say is: keep holding on!\n\n#learninginlockdown #lockdowndiaries #onlineclasses #newnormal #mmbpune #deutschlernenmachtspaï¿½ #goethebleibtzuhause #admissions #enrolnow","NumberOfLikes":210,"Hashtags":["#somepositivity","#learninginlockdown","#lockdowndiaries","#onlineclasses","#newnormal","#mmbpune","#deutschlernenmachtspaï¿½","#goethebleibtzuhause","#admissions","#enrolnow"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by GI-MMB Pune in Goethe-Institut \/ Max Mueller Bhavan Pune with @medhadevasthali.

Alberobello literally translates to \u2018Beautiful Tree\u2019. The Trulli or the beautiful houses with the conical roofs have an interesting story. History has it that back in the 15th century, every settlement was subjected to a tribute that had to be paid to the kingdom of Naples. The Counts who were the owners of the territory of Alberobello, merrily passed that on to the residents, of course. To work around this, the peasants decided to build their dwellings dry, without using mortar, so that they could be configured as precarious buildings and easily demolished. So technically, they were not a settlement:)\nHaving to use only stones, the peasants found in the round form with the self-supporting domed roof the simplest configuration. The roofs were embellished with decorative pinnacles representing the signature of the architect \u2018Master Trullaro\u2019. I like the idea of a bunch of peasants sitting around with the latest tax decree in their hands, thinking of how to get around it and coming up with the Trulli. Ladies and Gentlemen, you\u2019re looking at one of earliest recorded successful attempts at tax evasion. Full marks for getting around the system, and looking great while you\u2019re at it! Oh and the peasants last laugh is now a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site.

A good two weeks of study holidays we'll get now!\" Those two weeks snowballed into a month, then two months, and now more than four! Think about that - we've spent a third of this year indoors, and I can speak for all of us when I say that I don't really see the light at the end of the tunnel.?\n?\nTime and tide wait for no man, and neither does college - we've all been breaking our backs over online classes and those inane assignments, and now we're going where no man has gone before (in the most sarcastic sense of the phrase) and we're writing - or, shall I say, being forced to write - our exams FROM HOME!?\n?\nImagine, a year ago, if someone told you - You can write your exams in the same place you eat, shit and sleep. We'd all have roflmao-ed big time - but I guess none of us share that sentiment now xD. Very very different times indeed.?\n?\nAnyway, as we're all at home engineering new ways to ace the exams, here I am posting for the first time in months - a photo I clicked and edited in March (believe it or not!).

It calms you down and bring positivity. \n\nAlso if you are helping your surrounding, then I think it is also good for your family too. I started with 2 plants. Now I have around 24.
