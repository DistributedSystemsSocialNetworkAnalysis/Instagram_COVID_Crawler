Each family is different from the next. Now more than ever, parents need to support and lean on one another as the world is changing right before our eyes. As parents, we always do the best that we can for the love of our kids.\n\nTo me, modern parenting means raising kids with an open heart and mind. They are their own persons. They are little people who have their own minds and feelings and own paths to tread. Our role as parents is to give them all the tools to navigate and thrive in this world. \n\nLet\u2019s all come together and celebrate #ModernParentingLove!\u201D\n\nThanks so much, @modernparentingph, for making us part of this launch.

The measures and policies which governments have rolled out worldwide ever since Operation Coronavirus began \u2013 such as quarantine, lockdown, hand-washing, mask-wearing, social distancing and more \u2013 are in fact aspects of occult initiation ritual. These aspects have been cleverly adapted to the current fake pandemic and disguised as genuine public health strategies. As I covered in previous articles, this pandemic is a�9-11 type event which has been meticulously planned for decades. The people who run the world, whom I often call the New World Order (NWO) conspirators, leave very little to chance. They are�black magicians, and they are running this�live exercise�in a similar fashion to how they run their secret Satanic rituals.

Every frame was ineffably magical, deeply haunting and a story in itself. The protagonist played by Tripti Dimri, lingered in my head and heart for days on. This poignant tale replete with substantial elements of feminism, folklore and fantasy will take you on a sepia-toned ride through the eyes of Bulbbul and leave you with a lump in your throat and a tear in your eye. Watch it for the cinematography; the background score by Amit Trivedi and of course; for the brilliant portrayal of the lead characters, set in the late 1800s of pre-Renaissance Bengal, by the wonderful actors in the movie. Director Anvita Dutt scores big with this one!\n.\n.\nI picked up my art pencils after nearly three years for Bulbbul. I\u2019m a procrastinating \u201Cartist\u201D - so much so that I wonder if I\u2019m ever worthy of that word. I hope I\u2019ll stick to practicing more, at least this time around. Although portraits are my forte when it comes to pencil art, I did not have the confidence to fill in the facial features of Bulbbul. Also, like someone suggested, I liked the idea of leaving a part of Bulbbul to the imagination of the observer; after all, she was a mystery!\n.\n.\nThis sketch is made entirely from graphite art pencils. I drew the outline and grid lines with the Faber-Castell 0.5 mechanical pencil and then the base shading with an HB pencil. The depth and highlights for the dimensions were done with graphite art pencils from Cretacolor (my favourite brand of art supplies), ranging from 2B to 6B grades. A sharpener and a good quality eraser (cut up into pointed-edged pieces of different sizes so you can go into the nooks and corners of the sketch to add highlights\/ edit) are mandatory tools. The giant painting brush you see is to wipe away the debris of the eraser, because let\u2019s face it - unicorns might exist but \u201Cnon-dust erasers\u201D are a myth.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#bulbbul #bulbbulnetflix #pencilsketching #pencilart #graphitepencilart #pencildrawing #artist #artistsofinstagram #artoftheday #art #hobbies #lockdownlife #lockdowndiaries #2020mademedothis #lifeofanartist #blessed #thankful #grateful #lucky #destinyschild #indiancinema #triptidamri","NumberOfLikes":613,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Vidhya Menon Ahamed in Dubai, UAE with @tripti_dimri, and @netflix_in.

A day that is meant to be one of the most special days in your life turned into a real-life nightmare ? I haven\u2019t spoken about it much ? but let me just tell you all - being a #coronabride really kinda SUCKS\n?\nI went to my office to collect something for the first time in 4 months today - literally since Friday the 13th of March - it was incredibly eerie, super surreal and it bought back so many memories\n? \nOur world turned upside down pretty freaking fast... on Friday the 13th my brother found out he was in close contact with \u201Csomeone who was a close contact of a friend who travelled from Italy who tested positive\u201D - literally 2 days later she tested positive. We self isolated and another two days later is was my brother who tested positive! We were now \u201Cclose contacts\u201D - Knowing festivities were just days away we had to make the incredibly difficult decision to postpone... amongst the anxiety of awaiting our results! (Which were thankfully, negative!)\n?\nWe moved everything 1 year out... The date was rather significant and it seemed like the safest thing to do at the time. We did it just before that decision was taken out of our hands - the country went into a nationwide lockdown (starting the day of our \u201Cwedding\u201D - 27 March 2020)\n?\nIts been one crazy roller coaster of emotions - and some days are a little more challenging than others. Just trying to take it one day at a time - trying to strengthen my faith amongst the chaos, trying to find a glimmer of hope for our special day, grateful for all my people and their support during this time and trying to stay as sane as possible amongst the craziness!\nxXx\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n #justasocialbutterfly #flashesofdelight #myunicornlife #everysquareastory #theeverydayproject #theeverygirl #howyouglow #abmlifeiscolorful #blogging #chattycaptioncommunity #calledtobecreative #quote #thoughtoftheday #inspo #mood #lockdownsouthafrica #lockdowndiaries #stayingsane #coronabride #covidbride #covidruinseverything #2020bride #now2021bride #hopefullyoneday #weddingdiaries #newnormalwedding #weddingpostponed #postponedontcancel #postponedwedding","NumberOfLikes":16,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ???? ???? ????????????? in The New Normal.
