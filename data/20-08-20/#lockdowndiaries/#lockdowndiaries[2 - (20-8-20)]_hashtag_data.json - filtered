The human mind is not the principal target of the virus, but it can be very much a collateral casualty. Today, we grieve over the loss of a life as we once knew. 2020 will leave behind a complicated form of pain that will linger \u2014 potentially for many, many years even.\n\nThough we\u2019re far from the clear, I am thankful for the people who matter most: my family ? The lockdown has laid a sudden abundance of time on my lap. It has given me a chance to look back, make time for loved ones, and embrace life\u2019s micro-moments. \n\nMy life can be summarized through these concoction of sentences:lIt is getting out of bed with the deafening sound of my alarms (set for every five (5) minutes). It is rummaging through social media and my messages while enjoying a cup of coffee. It is placing plants by the window so they can get some sun. It is cleaning always-sticky countertops and floors that magically regenerate piles of loose hair, dust, and food crumbs.\n\nIt is preparing my son\u2019s cup of milk and bowl of cereal every morning. It is juggling distance learning and work-from-home duties. It is talking about passions and motherhood with Mom. It is cracking up to Dad\u2019s corny jokes. It is timely conversations with my sisters; sharing about current realities. It is non-stop bonding with my boys. It is reliving pre-pandemic days in my head. It is daydreaming of a life outside. It is reflecting on my truths, my fears, my failures, my hopes, and my discoveries.\n\nThis template I live day to day has pivoted my priorities, focusing on what matters. These days, I am present. I get to converse with my partner. I get to indulge Y with mom-son bonding. I get to see my parents in a different light and understand their methods more. I see a different side of my sisters. I discover ways on how  I can grow and live a life that\u2019s full.\n\nThis is #OurJourneyReimagined ? Life now may not be how it intended for us.

Now restrictions have been lifted, the pre-recorded weekly Zoom interviews are designed to provide insight into how our community of survivors are managing in the pandemic as a whole. A clip of each already posted to the DS channels is also posted to our feed to briefly introduce our wonderful Instagram audience and to give everyone a taster of personal affiliation with each survivor!\n\nLockdown interview number thirteen features stroke survivors Sheelagh and Niki. Sheelagh is our Administrator at Different Strokes. She had her stroke in 2018 at the age of 51. Niki had her stroke in October 2016 aged 52. She tells us about her atypical symptoms, her time in hospital and the home support, stimulation & exercise she received for the 6 weeks after. Niki talks about her anxieties, mental health problems and emotions, and tackles the taboo of how post stroke care focuses more on the physical and not enough psychological. She stresses the importance of seeking help and support and how it\u2019s essential to getting back on our feet. She also chats about family history, genetics and diabetes and how she combats these through diet and stress management. Niki talks about coming to terms with and working through accepting and acknowledging the new her. They both discuss the \u2018brick wall\u2019 caused by fatigue, how frustrating it can be and learning points on how to manage it.\n\nNiki has worked from home but like many of us has struggled with isolation. Unknowingly Niki contracted Covid-19 in March and only recently realised what felt like the flu was, in fact, the virus. She highlights the further barriers and complications for disabled people, including her Mum who has many at risk health conditions and is in a care home that has had outbreaks.\n\n Catch the full interview at:\n? https:\/\/differentstrokes.co.uk\/stroke-survivor-experiences-during-lockdown\/\n?? https:\/\/youtu.be\/nNBMW414umk\n?? https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/differentstrokescharity\/","NumberOfLikes":13,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1597658744,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 12:05:44 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Comment ?if this has helped you .\nBy reading books you get different  angles of solving problems.#bookrecommendations #lockdowndiaries #booksforselflearning","NumberOfLikes":12,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597653286,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 10:34:46 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Keshav Venkataraghavan sir\u2019s paintings left us entranced.

If you were, you wouldn\u2019t have anything to strive for. You have this one life to pursue your dreams. If you get the urge to create something with your life, do it! \n\nSometimes the tougher the circumstances are in our life, the more of a catalyst those circumstances will become in pushing us to fight for our dream.\n\nWhen you find that burning desire to be or do something, you\u2019ve found a powerful force that can cut through seemingly impossible circumstances and limitations.\n\nFor me passion is purpose. It\u2019s that desire to be someone or to do something. It moves you like nothing else in life. It\u2019s something you\u2019re attracted to, something you\u2019re passionate about and it fills you with joy and sets your heart on fire when you do it.\n\nTravelling fills me with joy and ignites my passion for living to the fullest on this planet. When I am not travelling I am always researching, browsing and planning to travel. It\u2019s always on my mind and in my spirit. \n\nIstanbul is one city I have visited a couple of times and yet there is so much left to see and explore. Love the mix of classic royal ottoman culture, modern day Europeanised influences, Islamic art, the delicious Turkish cuisine and the grand charming palaces on the steps of Bosphorus river. I simply cannot wait to travel to Turkey ?? again. \n\nOnce the world finally gets a handle on this deadly pandemic I will forever be grateful for a chance to travel again in peace. \n\n#travel #travelgram #instatravel #tourism #passportready #wanderlust #besties #forever #ilovetravel #passionpassport #suitcasetravels #traveldeeper #iamatraveller #discoveries #forbestravelguide #passion #travelislife #travelispassion #ciragan #palace #kempinski #istanbul #turkey #ottoman #empire #lockdowndiaries #postlockdowngoals #travelgoals #memories #travelmemories","NumberOfLikes":47,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by wanderlustbestiesforever? in Ciragan Palace Kempinski Istanbul.

The temple complex has a Panchamundi asan, a Dhunaghar and a Rath is also present which is taken out during rathyatra. The Saraswati river flows behind the temple. Although it has dried up, during this monsoon it was full to the brinks. The temple is very popular and sacred to the local mass.

Pandemic. \nLockdown was imposed in short interval notice and in a snap sound of fingers, many found themselves jobless, trapped inside. Privileged as me just had to get ourselves keep confined to our spaces. Real struggle was for them whose life started daily with sunrise and bread earned by long day hard work. Now there was no work.\nAs a photographers' perspective, shoots got cancelled, project delayed or denied. After a few days of not shooting, we started searching way to pursue passion. Business meetings started on conference video calls. Few photographers came with a temporary solution of shooting on video calls. Facetime shoots, WhatsApp Call shoots, Google video shoots, Skype shoot came in existence... in a shell, Virtual Shoots. Ofcourse not good as actual shoot, but \"...dil ko khush rakhne ko ghalib ye khayal achchha hai...\", it became a trend amongst photographers.\nAfter initial denial, me too thought to give it a try. Talked to few people connected with me. Now I am sharing few results. \nI won't call myself as Photographer for these shots, just a director. \n--- \u2022\u2022\u2022 ---\nIn picture: @dikshadesire\n--- \u2022\u2022\u2022 ---\n#virtual #shoot #virtualshoot #facetime #facetimephotoshoot #whatsapp #videocall #portrait_vision #pictureoftheday #photooftheday #pursuitofportraits #portrait_today #portrait_mood #portraitphotography #portrait_shots #portraiture #mood #moodygrams #snapseed #lockdowndiaries #lockdown #coronatime #portraitvision_ #pr0ject_uno #pr0ject_soul #portraitphotographer #couch #red #faceshot #expression","NumberOfLikes":37,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597505708,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 17:35:08 CEST 2020","Location":"India"},{"CaptionText":"Cup of Joe??\n\n#coffeelover #coffeeaddict #barristalife #espressolove  #caffeinedaily #coffeefirst #coffeeoclock #elixir is #coffeequotes #coffeesesh #coffeemania #coffeemaniac #coffeeeveryday #lockdowndiaries  #coffeeaddict  #caffeineaddict #caffeinated  #coffeesesh #cofeelovers #coffeewoman #capuchino","NumberOfLikes":5,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by bronzed_affair on August 15, 2020.

The downfall of indulging in this much caffeine is that my teeth are perma stained.\n\n\"Always brush your teeth; they will remain white\". That's what I've always heard. But not so easy to uphold when you're on your 6th cup of coffee at work and are running from one meeting to the next.\n\nIt's a bit easier to do so now that Melbourne is in lockdown (again!). But hard to scrape off the staining.\n\nI've been sent these whitening trays by @puresmileaustralia. So I'm definitely going to give these a go and let you know whether they shift the dial from perma stained to white. Let's see how this goes.\n\nAlso, do you like that green holder? I made that with my own hands on a potter's wheel when I visited Bendigo a few years ago (seems so long ago now). I also created a bowl. Which I use for trinkets and such at my night stand.\n\nHave you tried whitening trays before?
