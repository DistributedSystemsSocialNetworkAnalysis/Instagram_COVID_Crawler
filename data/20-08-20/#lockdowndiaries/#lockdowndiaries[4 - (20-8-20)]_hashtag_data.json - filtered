My idea of photography is to capture the specific moment to go back to them and relive it. Of course, as I share these images as my artwork, there is no way for the viewers to realize the essence of the moment that was for me. Therefore, I find myself often coupling my photographs with poetry or meaningful quotes. I feel this adds another layer to the images and give an opportunity to the viewer to be transported to their own moments of enrapture. My art demands not merely the skill of photography, but also the awareness of myself and the moments that would be worthy to be captured.\n\nSince the COVID-19 lockdown, stuck in my house, I have failed to come up with moments that hold my attention and emotions. The landscape has always brought out the best in me. I have felt alive in the magnanimity of nature at once. The awareness of my insignificance has inculcated humility in me. Being stuck at home now is not the best feeling. My avenue of expression has been hampered significantly. Even though I did not think of myself as an artist clicking these pictures, these have been the medium of my expression all this while. Currently, it is definitely a struggle to go through the rut of my regular office work and house chores, without having an out-let through such pictures.\n\n@anujkuriachan  is a 28-year-old IT professional who wants to capture nature\u2019s magnanimity through his photography. He is also an aspiring poet. He has his roots in Kerala but was born and raised in Delhi and has lived in Bangalore, Bhilai, and Kolkata. He shares his images of the clouds from pre-lockdown days. During the lockdown, captured from his terrace, the images translates into his wish for an escape.\nIf you or your artist-friends have a story to share, connect with us.\n.\n.\n.\n#ArtistsLockedIn\n#ArtistsoftheWorld #artistsupportartists #ArtistsofDelhi\n#artistsinquarantine #artistsinpandemic #artistsinlockdown #ArtistsDiary #artistsfromunderground #ArtistsinFocus #Lockdowndiaries #photography  #photosofinstagram #himalayas #cloudsofinstagram #cloudscape","NumberOfLikes":24,"Hashtags":["#ArtistsLockedIn","#ArtistsoftheWorld","#artistsupportartists","#ArtistsofDelhi","#artistsinquarantine","#artistsinpandemic","#artistsinlockdown","#ArtistsDiary","#artistsfromunderground","#ArtistsinFocus","#Lockdowndiaries","#photography","#photosofinstagram","#himalayas","#cloudsofinstagram","#cloudscape"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1597231863,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 12 13:31:03 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"artizay_artists","CaptionText":"Something that was pending from eons...

Talk of suicide and sexual abuse\/rape] Following the sad passing of Daisy Coleman, I have a lot of anger. If you are not familiar with her story, there is a documentary on Netflix called \u201CAudrie and Daisy\u201D She was raped at 14 but her rapists future was too bright and the town she lived in treated her like she was the criminal and the family ended up moving town. Daisy went on to become a sexual assault advocate but sadly took her life last week. \n\nI\u2019m so sick of this still being a problem in our society and men refusing to take responsibility for their actions.  Yes!! ALL MEN!!!\n\nI remember being a little girl talking to my friends about what to do if we ever get raped. Even at the age of 12, probably younger, we knew the likelihood of one of us being raped. I was walking around the park the other day and tears started to fall down my cheeks thinking of the tactics we came up with. Tell him you have aids so he won\u2019t carry on. Piss or shit yourself so he will be disgusted and stop. Just be silent and still so he won\u2019t hurt you and it will be over faster. And the most heart breaking, pretend you\u2019re enjoying it and he will stop because wants to see you in pain and uncomfortable. The thoughts of young girls in their still developing minds and bodies but putting things in place for when the time comes because we have been repeatedly told to protect ourselves against rapists. \n\n[continued in comments....]","NumberOfLikes":335,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Kayleigh | ? | She\/Her | ? on August 12, 2020.

Meditation ?\u200D?? a wonderful way to drop out of your head and into your body, into your heart and intuition. ?\n?\n? Journaling - I\u2019m a huge fan of journaling for so many different reasons! It\u2019s a great way to \u2018get stuff out\u2019, to help you release the feeling and process them. It\u2019s also a lovely way for your loving intuition to come through towards the end of the journal session with some loving words of wisdom and compassion. ?\n?\n? Be gentle with yourself. You\u2019re human, you\u2019re here having a human experience on earth. ?\n?\n? Reach out for support. Reach out to loved ones, friends, colleagues, coaches, healers and ask for what you need. ?\n?\nAnd lastly, please know that I am ALWAYS here for you.

Most of all, you taught me to never give up even if everything was falling apart. 25, I loved you and hated you equally. I loved you for how you stood by me even when the whole world was telling me to move onto another dream. I hated you because you made me question everything, you made me reach a point where certain aspects of life stopped making sense, more than usual. \u2028You made me understand the value of all the things I took for granted, you showed me the mirror and yanked me back into my place. You told me that the most important battle in life is not with something external but rather the one that is happening within. You taught me that at the end of the day, one might be surrounded by millions of people and yet truly only have themselves. From seeing one dream come into fruition to another flashing in red, oh how you have kept up the trend of making it a tale of two extremes.\nI laughed and I cried, and I tried to have my head held high. Quarter of my life has passed, and while most people around me have moved onto another phase of their life, I feel like mine has just begun. \n\nGoodbye 25, like all the previous years, you have been a lesson and a blessing.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n#BabbleNinja #candidphoto  #shotoniphone #malta #lovemalta #mobiography #shotoniphone11pro #iphoneography #iphonephotography #lockdownlife #lockdowndiaries #ootdbloggers #malta?? #parisianvibes #lockdownsessions #lockdowndays #balconylife #quarantinemood #fbloggerstyle #parisianstyle #quarantinestyle #bloggercommunity #bloggerstyle #malta #maltagram #valletta #lovemalta #igersmalta","NumberOfLikes":37,"Hashtags":["#BabblingInto26","#BabbleNinja","#candidphoto","#shotoniphone","#malta","#lovemalta","#mobiography","#shotoniphone11pro","#iphoneography","#iphonephotography","#lockdownlife","#lockdowndiaries","#ootdbloggers","#malta??","#parisianvibes","#lockdownsessions","#lockdowndays","#balconylife","#quarantinemood","#fbloggerstyle","#parisianstyle","#quarantinestyle","#bloggercommunity","#bloggerstyle","#malta","#maltagram","#valletta","#lovemalta","#igersmalta"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Rhea Nilanjana in Paris, France with @zara, and @delicatawinery.

He's so very happy! ?\nWe are condo-dwellers and space is very limited, so I've really thought of it and considered other options before getting this one. 5 months into lockdown, and no one knows how long to go, I felt the need to get him something. A gym of sort. \n\nI've really wanted a pikler triangle matagal na, but with limited space it may not be safe for him, plus the need to supervise him constantly while he's at it is not very appealing to me (being we have no helper). Also it is not budget friendly, what if he doesn't want it or magsawa agad, sakit sa bulsa nun momsh ?  But really I've wanted it, almost nabili ko na nga eh.\nAnd then I've searched for slides, daming options! I thought mukhang mabenta nga ito ngayon kasi kids can't go anywhere right now. I've settled for this one since it's convertible into a rocker, a slide & basketball ring, it is very compact suitable for our small space, budget-friendly (sulit), ang bait ng seller masipag mag-follow up (don't underestimate the power of follow-ups sa sales, proven time and again yan!), and may ganito yung friend ko kaya nabuyo nya na nga ako wahaha ? She measured it for me kaya ko na-consider na pwede because it's compact.\nIt sort of serves the purpose same as pikler's na rin since he can go up and down, climb, climb, slide.\n\nOnly drawback is the slide is already too low for him, long-legged kasi siya ?  I knew it from the start naman, thought of getting the higher slides but they are not convertible, I've decided that this 3in1 is more sulit and di siya magsasawa agad.\n\nI got this from Bulak Online Shop - search for them on Facebook.
