Bharat Manthan: reconditioning the idea of India through gut. A little wordplay on manthan - used both for brainstorming and churning (a food term), and using artistic license with the biochemical concept of gut-brain axis.\n\nThere are a few obvious addenda. That sizes and shapes are only for representation purpose and not to scale. That this is only an expansion of understanding of India, but in no means paints a \"complete\" picture. And I'm aware of the political aspects of vegetarian food in India.\n\nThere's more I've learned and thought while doing this. I'll try to write more about it soon.

It was a dream of mine to work in an action movie and it all started one evening on the Venduruthy Bridge in Cochin. Myself, Mithun and Rohit were brainstorming on the next project after Adam\u2019s Awakening. We threw a lot of ideas at each other out, most of which went into the water flowing beneath us but that night an exciting idea was born - 'to make a Malayalam action short film' - the name that we now know as Ghatakan. Through Ghatakan what I got to learn and explore was the action choreography and with another deep action fan, Thaha, this was a dream come true. It was a challenge for us, I must say, because none of the actors, including us, were trained in any stunt forms and suffice to say we were clueless. There was a lot of trial and error involved and with some practice, we came up with three action scenes, which I feel is the base of the film. The film basically cruises through the action scenes and the story, let's just say, takes a backseat. It was our first attempt and we were kind of satisfied with what we could pull of, considering the resources, time and money we had but one thing's for sure - we are going to start our own action choreography unit sometime soon!!! Alle @Thaha kolpad Ji??\n\nThe other thing I want to mention here before it gets into the boring territory is the music composed by Rohit and his team. It's simply contributes so much to the theme of Ghatakan.\n\nGhatakan is not your usual short film. It has its own simplicities and complexities. \nThis was an out and out experiment. we put our best efforts to make it what it turned out to be. It's been 5 years since the inception of this project. This video is the whole film and the memories associated with it under 5 minutes(My attempt to edit) .

For a Sagittarius Rising like me, it\u2019s made me reconsider what a journey really looks like.\n?????????\nAs of the last month I\u2019ve dedicated myself to a program called The Spiral, with this weeks session working with the heart chakra. Every week @theconnectedcreatress and I seek information about my current conditioning, what programs I\u2019m running in relation to each energetic space, and the corresponding stories and emotions. I also set new intentions to reset my experiences. How do I desire to feel, now? I\u2019ve had a few responses from friends stating how transformative or powerful, yet potentially daunting this sounds, but with little else to distract me, the journey of Spiral is pretty clear, and the integration has been sound. In fact, it\u2019s made the most sense to me to undertake this program in the current climate, since I know just how potent the current energy is, and what I\u2019ve already created from seeking support in my darkness.

Building a niche can be a highly valuable start up point, to which you can expand with time. \n\n??Purpose: Please consider creating and delivering content rich in substance so you can influence your followers in a meaningful way. This platform can actually give you great visibility and opportunities through sharing anything and everything you\u2019re passionate about. Whether that\u2019s your story, your business, or any other particular interest- There is a market for every single person out there, it\u2019s all down to your commitment and individuality. Plus the feedback youll get will be a lot more substantial and valuable than mere emojis and likes for likes ?\n\n??Engage: please refrain from believing in the insane idea that you shouldn\u2019t follow too many people back, or thinking you\u2019ll lose any value by responding to people\u2019s comments or private messages. You\u2019ll build a much more loving, loyal and solid following base by really connecting with people. Plus you will end up making friends along the way! ??\n\nTo be continued in my next post ?","NumberOfLikes":1065,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":93,"Timestamp":1596711693,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 06 13:01:33 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"\u201CUnknown Garden ....

This is a painting using poster colours I made the other day for practice sake and also to finalise what I'm going to eventually paint onto a canvas that my bae gifted me. So it's gotta be good! \n.\nHonestly, this is really not good. The lack of experience clearly shows and even though I'm okay with the colours used. The way it's been used and the ratios between them is bad. The tree in particular is just all over the place.\n.\nI'm happy with the sunset sky and the water and reflection. Of course there is tons of room for improvement. But the overall look of the background is working for me. Probably because I've done that sort of thing before. But I really have a long way to go as far as paintings go. \n.\nSo...Why did I put up an artwork I didn't like?\n.\nBecause I want to remember where I was so I know how far I've come when I look back on it in a while. Talent is nothing more than perseverance + consistency x time. It's math, not magic. I'm not calling myself talented or hard working. I'm just forcing myself to be accountable. \n.\n#sketching #sketchbook #sketch #100daysofpractice #adrawingaday #artistsoninstagram #artistsofinstagram #deviantart #artoftheday #art #emotionalart #arttherapy #isolationart #lockdowndiaries #lockdownlife #lockdowndays #trendingnow #trending #newoninstagram #posterpainting #trees #scenepainting #painterofthenight #paintersofinstagram #scribbleart #homage","NumberOfLikes":36,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1596633009,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 05 15:10:09 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"You have got to ask yourself what you're living for, who you are living for, and if none of those answers begin with you then you're living your life wrong .

After distributing the gifts, she asked, 'Mummy! When can we do this again?' Ever since, we celebrate festivals at the orphanage\u2013you can\u2019t put a price to their smiles. \nSo one day, during the lockdown, I saw a sweeper limping, yet doing his duty. I immediately gave him food, a mask & a sanitizer. His eyes lit up & he said, 'Thank you!' They were just 2 words, but I felt his gratitude & realised how little our essential workers have. \nSo I ordered sanitization kits & collaborated with a kitchen service to distribute them amongst essential workers, police & sweepers. My husband was worried about my safety, but I followed protocol. \nA week later, my son Shrey said, 'Ma, wait! I'm coming with you\u2019, & Meghna joined too. We went from Juhu to Marine Drive, distributing essentials amongst 400 workers.\nWe've been doing this for 2 months every weekend & the response has been heartwarming. A cop even asked Meghna for a selfie to show his kid! We even give free health check-ups to the elderly in our society. \nIt began last month, when my father-in-law had a low sugar episode. That\u2019s when Meghna said, 'Shouldn't we do something for the senior citizens too?' She\u2019s a doctor, so she attends to the elderly, while I arrange for their food & medicines. They live alone & they're scared\u2013we\u2019re just trying to make them feel less alone. \nLike one of the aunties had breast pain & feared it was cancer, until my daughter did a physical examination & calmed her down. \nBut that day when Meghna came home, I couldn\u2019t help but hug her. I'm so proud of the woman she's become. And Shrey too\u2013he's just 14, but he used all his birthday funds to buy essentials for 150 workers.\nWhen I began trying to make a difference 15 years ago, I barely had the resources. But now, with our NGO Meghashrey, we can do much more. \nI\u2019ve realised that if you really want to help, it takes one step. I started with funding my driver\u2019s son\u2019s education\u2013today he\u2019s a CA looking after his family. So that\u2019s what it\u2019s about\u2013taking that one step to help & you never know how that one step could change a person\u2019s life forever.\u201D","NumberOfLikes":35208,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":142,"Timestamp":1596630205,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 05 14:23:25 CEST 2020","Location":"Mumbai, Maharashtra"},{"CaptionText":"#Scenery #copied\n#natureartgallery\n#natureartwork \n#seashores\n#brustroa5notebook\n#brustropencilarts \n#involutedesign \n#artwork \n#lockdownart \n#quarantinelife \n#lockdowndiaries \n#artzoneforu #igdaily #igartwork #igart  #artoftheday #indianpromotionhouse","NumberOfLikes":24,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by vidu_artzone in Chitrakoot : A Cultural Heritage with @_artist_booth, @bindass_art, @brustro_official, @_._artistica_._, @art_revelations_india, @art.sharing101, and @artistcommunityindia.

Fonts. ??\u200D?? That\u2019s the level we reached today. \n\nLet\u2019s just say that today I went from feeling flat as a pancake to particularly \u201Cstabby\u201D. And I ate a lot of carbs. \n\nPMS may have been a factor here too. Does anyone else feel like this ronacoaster has amplified their PMS symptoms by about two thousand percent?! ??\n\nWe\u2019ve been dealing with some kind of intense restriction here since March. SIX months. And I think that with every new \u201Cannouncement\u201D or change, there is then a wave of emotion to navigate once again. There certainly isn\u2019t any rule book here my friends. And just when I think \u201CI\u2019ve got this\u201D, they sling something new our way. ?\n\nSo I think today, I\u2019m just still feeling the aftershock from the weekend and the latest round of restrictions (with a hefty dose of hormone thrown in for good measure!). \n\nI really need to hit reset. Shift myself out of this funk. Again. Oh how many times I said that over the past six months! But again, there\u2019s no guidebook for this. We just have to go day by day. \n\nAnd even though today won\u2019t make it into my \u201CTop Days in Iso\u201D, I actually can go to bed laughing at my ridiculously stroppy mood, sulky behavior, and hope that tomorrow may just bring a little shift in perspective. ??\n\nI\u2019ve got this. \n\nUntil tomorrow,\nLove Amelia xoxo\nPs. @theskinnyfatman I\u2019m sorry I was a mole today. ?","NumberOfLikes":44,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Amelia Williams on August 04, 2020.
