It is very timely and has many hints and tips for people that might be experiencing anxiety during this time. If this episode is a trigger for you, please contact Beyond Blue, COPE, a psychologist or your GP to assist. As you will hear it is a strength to seek help and not a weakness.?\n?\nDuring this episode Sarah and I discuss:?\n* Sarah's family set up with her husband as a stay at home dad?\n* Defining anxiety?\n* What can we do if we recognise if we are experiencing anxiety - self helps and seeking help strategies are discussed?\n* Managing anxiety during covid-19?\n* Sharing the mental load between couples and how important this is especially for new parents and ongoing when raising children?\n* Striving for being a \"good enough\" parent rather than perfect?\n* Managing mum guilt when returning to work after maternity leave?\n* Managing expectations of new mum during parenting journey?\n?\nThere is a lot covered in this episode and I hope you enjoy everything we discuss. ?\n?\nIf you are in Melbourne this episode might be of extra interest given the current stage 4 lockdown measures.  I'm in this with you and hope you and your family stay safe.?\n?\nThis episode has helped me since we recorded it and I hope it helps you as well.

Was previously using a tiny, made-in-Delhi one which arrived with 2 out of 4 knobs detached and multiple screws loose. Nevertheless, it served me well and was well worth the \u20B92K I spent on it (plus the \u20B95 Fevi-kwik for it to not fall apart).\n\nBut this new one is a beast. Settled on it after visiting virtually every store in Bangalore, trying different ones over and over again, watching countless YouTube review videos and comparisons, stalking eCommerce sites and feeling disappointed on being told how stocks reach India often years after the actual release date.\n\nAfter bugging Furtados for weeks, they finally got 1 unit from Mumbai just for me. \n\nWhat followed was the bigger challenge of finding an auto that night from Koramangala to HSR Layout. With the store closing, it starting to rain and with no cabs seemingly available, my pocket was relieved of another 350\/- by the great Bangalore auto anna experience. \n\nFurther adventures followed, like me dropping *freaking* moisturizer through the grill, over the tube of the preamp, within a week. What luck, I mean, maybe I would use moisturizer once a year? and for it to drip in the exact few centimetres where it shouldn't. \n\nGreat amp though. Been 4 months away already. Looking forward to practicing on it again whenever I do return back to Bangalore or maybe vacate my flat and get everything shipped to Bhilai?

We were supposed to collect 2 Saturday from Crawley and then another 2 Sunday from Stoke, but when we got to the first place, the seller said they had 3 babies that hadn\u2019t been collected that needed homes and did we want them, so of course we did! It meant we had an established brood of hens who already got on, and we didn\u2019t have to travel to stoke the next day either!\nI\u2019m letting them settle in properly and trying not to disturb them too much just yet, but when I can, I\u2019ll take some photos of them individually and you can have a proper good look at each one!\nThank you to everyone for the naming suggestions, they were so cute! We have chosen to call them:\nMargot (after Margot Robbie)\nRuby (after Ruby Rose)\nPippa (after Joe\u2019s family dog)\nFearne (after Fearne Cotton)\nHolly (after Holly Willoughby)\n??\nI think the older two are 7-8 weeks and the younger ones maybe 6 weeks old?

This is one of the largest and most elaborately patterned owls in the subcontinent, spread through most forested areas in the Western Ghats, Himalayan foothills and parts of northern Eastern Ghats and Central India. \nIv seen them a few times in Kanha and Thattekaad before but always wanted to see one near home, especially since their eerie call can be heard almost every night in the woods here. \n\nYesterday, the wait ended. Our neighbour informed us of a large owl on a tree with a jungle fowl kill... And this was at 9am. What followed was one of my best encounter with this titan of the night sky. It stood there, majestically with its kill, on the branch of a large Jamun tree, fending off large flocks of birds, both large and small, which kept trying to mob the owl. After every wave of bullying ended, the owl would feed a bit and start vibrating it's throat (gular fluttering) believed to help it loose excess heat. \nThis encounter lasted a good few hours and we observe all of this from a good distance, in high definition thanks to the long range birding scope ATX 95 from Swarovski. All these videos and images have been shot using my Lumix mounted to perfection on the Swarovski scope...and the quality is surprisingly flawless. \nA bit of luck and a good field kit that is quickly deployable, ensured one of the most memorable birding encounters ive had in Indian forests. \n\n#swarovskioptik #swarovski #ATX95 #lumixgh5s #lumix #Birding #birdingasia #bubo #owlsofinstagram #nightbirds #raptorsonkill #raptors #owls #owling #earlybird #nutsaboutbirds #seetheunseen #indianbirds #birder #birds #birdsofprey #birdsofinstagram #birdphotography #indianwildlifephotographer #indianwildlife #nature #backyardwildlife #lockdowndiaries @swarovskioptik_birding @andbeyondtravel @andbeyondasia","NumberOfLikes":155,"Hashtags":["#swarovskioptik","#swarovski","#ATX95","#lumixgh5s","#lumix","#Birding","#birdingasia","#bubo","#owlsofinstagram","#nightbirds","#raptorsonkill","#raptors","#owls","#owling","#earlybird","#nutsaboutbirds","#seetheunseen","#indianbirds","#birder","#birds","#birdsofprey","#birdsofinstagram","#birdphotography","#indianwildlifephotographer","#indianwildlife","#nature","#backyardwildlife","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Felis Creations on August 03, 2020.

So, I make Mandalas when I feel like making them. When I know that making them would bring me the much required inner peace and strength! \n\nHere\u2019s a little mini-Mandalas beauty that I created! Once again, I would like to say that my work isn\u2019t the finest right now, but I\u2019m taking baby steps. ??\n\nP.S - You\u2019ll always find Pencil markings! ? I\u2019m just too scared to erase them lest it disturbs the art. ?\n\n#_mandala_drawings #mandalas #mandalalovers #mandalasharing #mandalasofinstagram #mandala #follow #indian #patterns #tutorials #pinterest #tagblender #blackandwhite #monochrome #covid #lockdowndiaries #medstudentdiaries #medschooldiaries #art #artistsoninstagramfollowme #artpage #etsyshop #orchids #etsyindia #artpage #mandalatutorials","NumberOfLikes":34,"Hashtags":["#_mandala_drawings","#mandalas","#mandalalovers","#mandalasharing","#mandalasofinstagram","#mandala","#follow","#indian","#patterns","#tutorials","#pinterest","#tagblender","#blackandwhite","#monochrome","#covid","#lockdowndiaries","#medstudentdiaries","#medschooldiaries","#art","#artistsoninstagramfollowme","#artpage","#etsyshop","#orchids","#etsyindia","#artpage","#mandalatutorials"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Black Ink Pot on August 02, 2020 tagging @_mandala_drawings, @the.greatest.mandalas, @hallofmandalas, @mandalatutorial, @colorearte_mandalas, and @mandala.sharing.lover.

This is the name given to the program which provides repatriation services for millions of Indians. \nRepatriation. It is the process of sending back someone to their place of origin. In this case, an exodus of Indians who had lost their jobs and wanted to return home. People who no longer have a reason to stay & prefer spending their days with family & friends rather than sit & fret over the trials and tribulations of the pandemic on their own. When I recently offered to assist In the process of repatriating one such troubled individual, I was flabbergasted by the price of the ticket. This was the price they had to pay to return home? How is that even justified? Many of them had lost their jobs- they were returning into uncertain times- why did they have to pay such a price for a pandemic that had diminished their dreams? Why is it that the poor are always invisible? They build a country with their labour. Roads would not be laid without their hard work, buildings would not be built without their dexterity, litter would not be picked, maintenance would not be done, children would not be cared for & the list just goes on. Why are they trodden upon in times of need? An entire population was ignored when the lockdown was declared- we saw the poor & the hungry walking miles & miles to get back to their homes. A similar multitude is here- no jobs, no place to stay & not enough money to fly back home. And yet they have to pay the price- they always have to pay the price. Because in this world,  society & corrupt governments thrive because of them & by squeezing the life out of them. The rich become richer and the poor become poorer.

The yoyo of the rollercoaster where I go from extreme excitement and future promise with opportunities and conversations that give hope and light at the end of the tunnel. Through to the guilt then feeling with this top of the peak and literally within a few hours or a day can be as low as you can feel, being knocked by others, being attacked or purposefully vilified. By seeing the past and future you built wash away and all you\u2019ve built turn to dust. \n\nOr perhaps it\u2019s the dodgems or bumper cars. The sense of being pushed from pillar to post, knocked from one thing to the next feeling like a lack of control. \n\nMaybe its the ghost tunnel ride, the one where you are constantly fearful and you are almost holding you breathe for something to jump out and scare the crap out of you. The level of anxiety building in you until you finally reach the end and take an enormous deep breath. \n\nMaybe its the carousel where you feel like things are just going round and round and nothing is changing, up and down, round and round, same in same out on a wheel you can\u2019t get off. \n\nThe list goes on... but whether it feels like it\u2019s spinning so fast you\u2019re nauseous or you can\u2019t catch your breath on the ups and downs of the rollercoaster they do all come to an end. \n\nLockdown will end, this pandemic will be over, the valley we are in will become a mountain again and it will be over. \nBut we also learn that the rollercoaster is so good BECAUSE of the pits and the peaks. If it was all at the top it would be straight, and quite frankly boring. And although boring is safe it\u2019s not life.\nKnowing your emotional ups and downs are natural, and you don\u2019t have do anything but hold on. \n\nSo let\u2019s just make our seatbelt more snug, and hold on tighter... let\u2019s see out this ride... it will end!","NumberOfLikes":22,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Kate Shepherd on August 01, 2020.

Like I mentioned in my previous post, I had received my @maccosmetics lipsticks in the mail yesterday. I had ordered 2 lipsticks from @mynykaa app & got a free M.A.C. mini fix spray & A Full Size Free Powderkiss Lipstick. Will Be Posting Swatches Of All Three Lipsticks Soon. Have already reviewed Marrakesh in my last post.\nSwatched Here Is Lipstick #2:-M.A.C. Matte Lipstick In \u2018Velvet Teddy\u2019. \nOk, so I had in my previous purchase from M.A.C. Bought a full sized \u2018yash\u2019 expecting the same colour payoff as \u2018Velvet Teddy\u2019, which is a Gorgeous Pinkish Nude Colour, that looks great  on my skin tone. So This time, keeping in mind the current COVID situation, & M.A.C.\u2019s no try before buy stipulation (for everyones\u2019 safety), I bought the Mini Version. I personally feel MAC should have mini versions of all their lipsticks. Saves a lot of money in case you\u2019re stuck with a shade that makes you feel less than fabulous. Now, While \u2018Yash\u2019 totally washed out my complexion, \u2018Velvet Teddy\u2019 subtly enhanced it. It\u2019s a perfect nude for fair to very fair skin tones & will give you a stunning glammed up look especially, when paired with a smoky eye makeup. In this pic I\u2019ve used M.A.C.\u2019s \u2018Whirl\u2019 Lip Pencil to line my lips &, then applied Velvet Teddy. Like Marrakesh this shade too is very versatile. Even after blotting my lips, the colour payoff was not compromised. Towards the end it blended with my natural lip tone and left a pretty pinkish tint. \n\nBonus:- Like Most Matte Lipsticks From M.A.C. This Too Is Pretty Long lasting. \nLove This Nude! It\u2019s Definitely A Must Buy For Fair Skinned Girls Like Me.???? \nHope This Helps.\n#nomakeupselfiejustlips #nofilterselfie #confessionsofashopaholic #lipstickaddict #lipstickjunkie #lipstickcollector #lipstickhoarder \n#maccosmetics #macvelvetteddy #lockdowndiaries #lockdownlife #selfieaddictbackinaction #selfieobsessed #selfobsessed \n@maccosmeticsindia @maccosmetics \n@mynykaa @nykaabeauty","NumberOfLikes":15,"Hashtags":["#2:-M.A.C.","#nomakeupselfiejustlips","#nofilterselfie","#confessionsofashopaholic","#lipstickaddict","#lipstickjunkie","#lipstickcollector","#lipstickhoarder","#maccosmetics","#macvelvetteddy","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdownlife","#selfieaddictbackinaction","#selfieobsessed","#selfobsessed"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by divino.chocolatiers in Gurgaon, Indian NCR with @maccosmetics, @rachiita.kapur, @mynykaa, @nykaabeauty, and @maccosmeticsindia.

But the basic thing is that he is very much afraid of being lonely. Loneliness is a black hole, a darkness, a frightening negative state almost like death \u2026 as if you are being swallowed by death itself. To avoid it, you run out and fall into anybody, just to hold somebody\u2019s hand, to feel that you are not lonely\u2026 Nothing hurts more than loneliness.\nBut the trouble is, any relationship that arises out of the fear of being lonely is not going to be a blissful experience, because the other is also joining you out of fear. You both call it love. You are both deceiving yourself and the other. It is simply fear, and fear can never be the source of love. Only those who love are absolutely fearless; only those who love are able to be alone, joyously, whose need for the other has disappeared, who are sufficient unto themselves\u2026\n\nThe day you decide that all these efforts are failures, that your loneliness has remained untouched by all your efforts, that is a great moment of understanding. Then only one thing remains: to see whether loneliness is such a thing that you should be afraid of, or if it is just your nature. Then rather than running out and away, you close your eyes and go in. Suddenly the night is over, and a new dawn \u2026 The loneliness transforms into aloneness.\n\nAloneness is your nature. You were born alone, you will die alone. And you are living alone without understanding it, without being fully aware of it. You misunderstand aloneness as loneliness; it is simply a misunderstanding. You are sufficient unto yourself.\n\nOsho\n\nYou are complete, this world is complete. \n\n#solitude #strong #peaceful #instagood #instagram #goodread #positivevibes #aloneness #wisdom #osho \n#random\n#lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":137,"Hashtags":["#solitude","#strong","#peaceful","#instagood","#instagram","#goodread","#positivevibes","#aloneness","#wisdom","#osho","#random","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Aroh Sharma on August 01, 2020.
