On the 28th, I had appeared for my M.Phil interview, met up with janaab-e Anas Zaman who was also done with his, and escaped to Connaught Place and Bangla Sahib Gurudwara for a memorable day of winding down after the anxiety of the morning. Today, on the 29th, I woke up to a sudden, defiant urge that had taken over mind and body, refusing to let go. This Calcutta-born, 21st century Timurid simply had to make that long-overdue pilgrimage to Panipat, bringing life full circle in some ways and becoming one with that spot on the map where it all started in 1526. The experiences of those few hours resonate still. A different kind of homecoming brought this stretch to a close two days later, as I surprised Baba (returning to the country after his latest voyage) at the Delhi airport late at night and caught the same redeye flight to Calcutta, and the arms of our family. Such spontaneity, such ease of movement, such proximity of those closest to us, and such nonchalant leisure seems a figment of our imaginations since March, 2020. And thus, while looking forward, some of us are also looking back. :)\n\n#pandemicdiaries #lockdowndiaries #heritage #indianheritage #delhiheritage #haryanaheritage #mughalheritage #banglasahib #kabulibagh #gurudwarasofdelhi #mosquesofindia #panipat #worldbeforecovid19 #lifebeforecorona #hope #lookingback #lookingbackmovingforward #life #delhigram #travelgram #historygram #history #delhi_igers #heritagephotography #travelindia #medievalindianhistory #natgeoindia","NumberOfLikes":25,"Hashtags":["#pandemicdiaries","#lockdowndiaries","#heritage","#indianheritage","#delhiheritage","#haryanaheritage","#mughalheritage","#banglasahib","#kabulibagh","#gurudwarasofdelhi","#mosquesofindia","#panipat","#worldbeforecovid19","#lifebeforecorona","#hope","#lookingback","#lookingbackmovingforward","#life","#delhigram","#travelgram","#historygram","#history","#delhi_igers","#heritagephotography","#travelindia","#medievalindianhistory","#natgeoindia"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1596045552,"LocalDate":"Wed Jul 29 19:59:12 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"the_legges","CaptionText":"\u201COh I do like to be beside the seaside.\u201D..... definitely a reoccuring theme in our house at the moment! ?\n\nI guess we are trying to be \u2018at peace\u2019 with the sea so that our friend is on our side.\n\n...\n\n#instakids #seasidevibes #beachdaysarethebestdays #familytime #treasureeveryday #kidsofinstagram #kidsfun #bedtime #familymatters #tribeoflikes #mindfulness #openyourmind #kidsofig #childhoodunplugged #documentyourdays #mummydiaries #mummylife #mumofboyslife #mumlife #thebestbits #mumofboys #lockdowndiaries #everythingwelove #myboysmyjoys #theygrowuptoofast #alwaysmybabies #mumofboys #yayitsanewtag","NumberOfLikes":188,"Hashtags":["#instakids","#seasidevibes","#beachdaysarethebestdays","#familytime","#treasureeveryday","#kidsofinstagram","#kidsfun","#bedtime","#familymatters","#tribeoflikes","#mindfulness","#openyourmind","#kidsofig","#childhoodunplugged","#documentyourdays","#mummydiaries","#mummylife","#mumofboyslife","#mumlife","#thebestbits","#mumofboys","#lockdowndiaries","#everythingwelove","#myboysmyjoys","#theygrowuptoofast","#alwaysmybabies","#mumofboys","#yayitsanewtag"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1596028738,"LocalDate":"Wed Jul 29 15:18:58 CEST 2020","Location":"Palm Bay, Kent"},{"Owner":"shayar_with_stethoscope","CaptionText":"??? ??? ??? ?? ?? ??? ???? ??????? ???????? ????\nPic @__sumita_shree__ \n.\n.\n.\n.\n#banarasiya #bnarasighat #assighat_varanasi #banarsiishq #poetryofinstagram #poetrylovers #shayri #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":43,"Hashtags":["#banarasiya","#bnarasighat","#assighat_varanasi","#banarsiishq","#poetryofinstagram","#poetrylovers","#shayri","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by DOCTOR SAHEB?? in ????? ???, ??????? with @banarasi_isqh, @khuddar_shayar, @banarasiishq, @banarasi____panditayin____, @thekashiwords, @gulzar.ki.shayari, @mohalla_assi80, @banarasi_jaan, @__sumita_shree__, and @shayar_with_stethoscope.

Aloe is great for sensitive skin, so I'm excited to give it a try. \n\n\u2022 Lastly, purchased the Drops Of Youth Bouncy Eye Mask.

Never did we imagine, the lockdown to be the handcuffs to our freedom. The little elements of freedom like walking to a station, commuting to office, meeting friends along the way or just going freely to a shopping arcade without a mask. The new evolving normal has got us rethinking on the definition of freedom - did we underestimate it earlier? \n\nMumbai is said to be the city of dreams for everyone who comes to the city. As residents of the city or as Mumbaikars, have we underestimated the value of our daily life? Have we got so busy in our day to day lives, that we did not value the little things we enjoyed doing in the city like catching a noisey packed local train, eating our fav roadside sandwich, sitting along the waterfront enjoying the water flow, going to the beach, a long drive late at night or going to restaurants. Something to think over indeed. \n\nTill then let's sit at home watching the beautiful birds fly around enjoying the non polluted and peaceful environment. \n\n#lockdown #lockdown2020 #lockdownlife #lockdowndiaries #lockdownmemes #lockdownphotography #environment #environmentallyfriendly #birds #birdsofinstagram #birdstagram #instagram #mumbaikar #mumbai #outsidemywindow #loveforlove #loveforheritage #flying #loveforall #workfromhome #workfromhomelife #workfromhomejobs #workfromhomeopportunity #safe #safetyfirst #saferathome #safety #safeathome #safespace #staysafe","NumberOfLikes":199,"Hashtags":["#lockdown","#lockdown2020","#lockdownlife","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdownmemes","#lockdownphotography","#environment","#environmentallyfriendly","#birds","#birdsofinstagram","#birdstagram","#instagram","#mumbaikar","#mumbai","#outsidemywindow","#loveforlove","#loveforheritage","#flying","#loveforall","#workfromhome","#workfromhomelife","#workfromhomejobs","#workfromhomeopportunity","#safe","#safetyfirst","#saferathome","#safety","#safeathome","#safespace","#staysafe"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Amruta in Mumbai, Maharashtra with @mumbai_igers, @mumbai_uncensored, @nature, @_aamchi_mumbai_, @livehistoryindia, @mumbaiguide_, @unseen.mumbai, @wahhmumbai, @photographers.of.mumbai, @lockdown_0memes, @vantasmumbai, @maximum_mumbai, @naturephotography__53, @birds_photography_beginners, @lockdown_gig, @_lockdown__photography_, @mumbaitraveldiaries, @bombaycitylights, @mumbaimasala.official, and @lockdown_musings8.

And even then it was a pic in my night gown trying to convince a friend to meet as is because the 1st lockdown had eased and we were slowly WANTING to get back together. Thankfully we met.

When I was in Dubai, my Amma had a Sindhi colleague in her bank by the name of Gobind Thawrani. He was always ready to help out and whenever he came to Bombay to meet his parents, he faithfully got back some sev barfi. The best thing about this sweet, is that you can have it cold or warm. When we came back to India in 1996, we used to get our stash from Tharu in Khar West and more recently from Chembur diagonally opposite Vigs. Bathed in ghee and cloying sweet, but I loved to have a few spoons of it as well as the cylindrical gulab jamuns with a single pistachio in the middle! Then @just.a.pinchofsalt showed me the menu by @chiselledmealsbymeeta last week and there was no doubt that we were getting the sev barfi from her. We ordered just 250 g (I wish we had ordered a kilo of this hehe!) and the first mouthful itself was heavenly! A generous amount of almond and pistachio flakes, the required amount of ghee and the absolute perfect degree of sweetness... The consistency was almost like the khara prashad! Guys if you want to taste good, homestyle sev barfi, Meeta Kataria is your go to lady!

The pre-recorded interviews take place via Zoom and are posted every Tuesday afternoon. You can find them all on the Different Strokes website, Facebook page and YouTube channel - but over the next couple of weeks, a snippet of each already posted to the DS channels are going to be introduced to our wonderful Instagram audience, to give everyone a taster of personal affiliation with each survivor.\u2063\n\u2063\nLockdown interview number five features stroke survivors Sheelagh and Belinda. Sheelagh is our Administrator at Different Strokes. She had her stroke in 2018 at the age of 51. Belinda had her stroke in 2015 at the age of 47. Belinda spoke to Sheelagh about her Neurofatigue, her process to recovery, the impact lockdown has had on that and how she\u2019s had to adapt with having her Mum in the house when she still needs time alone to manage her condition. She also talks about the little things like how her shopping delivery has become a highlight, how she\u2019s keeping occupied with crafting and colouring and the Different Strokes Facebook group being a game changer for her mentality and wellbeing.\u2063\n\u2063\n Catch the full interview at:\u2063\n? https:\/\/differentstrokes.co.uk\/stroke-survivor-experiences-during-lockdown\/\u2063\n?? https:\/\/youtu.be\/nNBMW414umk\u2063\n?? https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/differentstrokescharity\/\u2063\n\u2063\n#stroke #strokesurvivor #strokesurvivors #youngstrokesurvivor #strokesurvivorsneverquit #strokerecovery #strokeawareness #lifeafterstroke #strokestories #strokerehabilitation #strokecare #strokelife #strokewarrior #braininjury #braininjurysurvivor #lockdownlife #lockdowndiaries #stayingconnected #zoommeeting #quarantinelife #quarantinedays #quarantinestories #covid19 #covid2020 #charityorganization #neurofatigue #communitygroup #communitymatters #disability #disabilityservices","NumberOfLikes":25,"Hashtags":["#stroke","#strokesurvivor","#strokesurvivors","#youngstrokesurvivor","#strokesurvivorsneverquit","#strokerecovery","#strokeawareness","#lifeafterstroke","#strokestories","#strokerehabilitation","#strokecare","#strokelife","#strokewarrior","#braininjury","#braininjurysurvivor","#lockdownlife","#lockdowndiaries","#stayingconnected","#zoommeeting","#quarantinelife","#quarantinedays","#quarantinestories","#covid19","#covid2020","#charityorganization","#neurofatigue","#communitygroup","#communitymatters","#disability","#disabilityservices"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1595930195,"LocalDate":"Tue Jul 28 11:56:35 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"unique.art1111","CaptionText":"?\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#sketchoftheday #artofinstagram #digitalart #girly #girlyart #bluehair #whitedress #sketchartwork #illustration #illustrationartists #illustragram #colorful #artofinstagram #artistic #creation #handmade #digitallycolored #pintrest #pintrestinspired #ideas #colorcombination #artist #artwork #artholic #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":156,"Hashtags":["#sketchoftheday","#artofinstagram","#digitalart","#girly","#girlyart","#bluehair","#whitedress","#sketchartwork","#illustration","#illustrationartists","#illustragram","#colorful","#artofinstagram","#artistic","#creation","#handmade","#digitallycolored","#pintrest","#pintrestinspired","#ideas","#colorcombination","#artist","#artwork","#artholic","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":22,"Timestamp":1595928869,"LocalDate":"Tue Jul 28 11:34:29 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"shoot.at.sight_","CaptionText":".\n.\n.\n.\n#shootatsightphotography  #naturephotography \n#flowers #morningbliss #flowersofinstagram\n#canonphotography #canon\n#palakkadanbeauty #keralagram \n#lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":23,"Hashtags":["#shootatsightphotography","#naturephotography","#flowers","#morningbliss","#flowersofinstagram","#canonphotography","#canon","#palakkadanbeauty","#keralagram","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Sreejith Palakulam on July 28, 2020.

On his return from the Portuguese invasion in 1676, Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj recognised the geographical location and importance of the hill and built the fort to permanently attack the Portuguese, Adilshah and Khem Sawant of Sawantwadi. It was named as \"Pargad\" as the fort at the end of the Swarajya. After climbing 360 steps of the 16th century, we are greeted by the remnants of cannons on the surface and the saffron flag fluttering in the air. On the left hand side is the Maruti temple. Going further, on the right hand side, you come across the magnificent temple of Bhavani Mata, which was restored by Gadkari (People who stays on the fort). There are 17 wells of Shiva period on the fort, out of which 4 are in good condition. In the north-western tour of the coast, you can see 3 magnificent towers namely Bhalekar, Phadnis and Mahadev. Apart from this, there are other towers called Malve, Bhande, Zende bastions. On the north side of the fort, there is a Mahadev temple on the bank of the valley.\n\n@shodhashodh @virajt_dd11 @jayedeepjagtap1 and Me ?","NumberOfLikes":79,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":7,"Timestamp":1595908021,"LocalDate":"Tue Jul 28 05:47:01 CEST 2020","Location":"Pargad Fort"},{"Owner":"creativephotography1416","CaptionText":"?Capture by-@suchis_19 \n#lockdowndiaries ?\n?
