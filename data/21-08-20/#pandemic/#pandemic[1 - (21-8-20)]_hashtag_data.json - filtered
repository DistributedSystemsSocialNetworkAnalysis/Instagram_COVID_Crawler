Through my youth, I\u2019ve lived and visited many places, I had the blessing of meeting people from all walks of life. I\u2019m just a common man, trying to find a path to help my fellow humans, and thanks to all of that, now I find myself as a beginner, amateur author, who pretends with some luck to make the world a better place. To participate in a project such as this, is a kind of activity that makes you stop and reflect on the life of everyone around you. Therefore, after I accepted the invitation Nana Iavorschi Cnejevici made me, to participate in this book, I reached out to as many friends and family as I possibly could to ask them their views of the \u201CCOVID-19 crises\u201D in order to reflect the feelings and sensations that not only I but rather everyone felt during this worldwide event. I hope that in my words and those of my fellow authors, the readers of this book find a sense of unity as that is the only hope that we as a kind have to overcome the challenges that the future hold on us all. We have come a long way as societies, but its now, after the 2020 pandemic experience that we have the chance to reflect on the mistakes and injustices we, as a civilization have committed, because it\u2019s now with this sense of unity that we have the chance to change the course of the future. A better tomorrow is only possible through the care and respect for each other as for the environment that surrounds us. So, years apart from now, when the future generations look back to us and hopefully find this book, they\u2019ll see how even though we live in many places and our lives are very different, in the end, our story is only one, the story of humankind, and that should be enough to make us unite and fight for the survival of the planet as we know it.\n\n#worlspandemicchronicles #covid_19 #covid19 #mexico #pandemic #pandemia  #pandemicdiary","NumberOfLikes":0,"Hashtags":["#worlspandemicchronicles","#covid_19","#covid19","#mexico","#pandemic","#pandemia","#pandemicdiary"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @worldspandemicchronicles on August 21, 2020.

The endothelial cells can be damaged either directly (direct pathway, see attached figure) or indirectly (indirect pathway, see attached figure) by accumulating Angiotensin II (that circulates in blood) and generation of toxic reactive oxygen species (free radicals that cause oxidative stress) that can damage the inner lining of the blood vessel wall. \n\nSee link to the full text of the article below where the mechanism of blood clotting in #COVID19 namely Steps 1 to 8 are explained in detail in combination with Figure 1:\n=>https:\/\/lnkd.in\/grhcjKC\n\n#covid?19 #covid19awareness #StrikeOutClots #StrikeOutStroke #stroke #brainattack #brain #STEMI #heartattack #heart #pulmonaryembolism  #PE #lungs #VTE #DVT #covidtoes #bloodclots #bloodclotting #Clots #thrombus #thrombosis #global #pandemic #awareness #savinglives #reducemortality #togetheragainstcovid19 @snis_info @wlnc @cns_update @aanbrain @the_asnr @american_heart @who @cdcgov @wsj","NumberOfLikes":0,"Hashtags":["#SARSCoV2","#COVID19","#covid?19","#covid19awareness","#StrikeOutClots","#StrikeOutStroke","#stroke","#brainattack","#brain","#STEMI","#heartattack","#heart","#pulmonaryembolism","#PE","#lungs","#VTE","#DVT","#covidtoes","#bloodclots","#bloodclotting","#Clots","#thrombus","#thrombosis","#global","#pandemic","#awareness","#savinglives","#reducemortality","#togetheragainstcovid19"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Vallabh Janardhan on August 21, 2020.

Country music runs deep in my veins, having been brought up on it via my parents and grandparents, however I briefly shied away from my love of country during my early teens and boarding school life ( Country was deemed daggy and you were terribly \u201CUn-Cool\u201D if you liked it ). Rediscovering my love for Dolly again at 16, Songs like \u201CCoat Of Many Colours\u201D, \u201CHere You Come Again\u201D and \u201CShattered Image\u201D remain some of my favourites, her incredible song writing skills and Smokey Mountain, Songbird sweetness, providing me with a lifelong soundtrack. Her music has gotten me through some sad times ( \u201CWildflowers \u201C ), and some happy times ( \u201CBaby I\u2019m Burning ), somehow her voice always makes me feel good, especially during this whole Covid-19, stage 4 lockdown, pandemic mess!

In a pandemic, to survive tough businesses you need razor-sharp thinking. A must-read book for CEOs, entrepreneurs and start-up founders on how to deal with uncertainty. Author Ozan Varol @ozanvarol who served the 2003 Mars Exploration Rovers project, talks about how, \"We're hesitant to think big, reluctant to dance with uncertainty and afraid of failure. These are the bugs.\"\nHere are 7 Secrets of How to Think Like a Rocket Scientist:\nRule 1: Make Doubt your Superpower. Every genius hesitates. We should be fueled not by a desire for a quick catharsis but by intrigue. Where certainty ends, progress begins. Einstein tangoed with uncertainty, conducted imaginative thought experiments and asked questions nobody dared.\nRule 2: Embrace the sense of possibilities, push your limits, explore what is possible.\nRule 3: Question your assumptions. Why you do the things you do. Don't do things that everyone does.\nRule 4: Don't be stuck in systems. They solve problems that don't even exist today.\nRule 5: Create Moonshot goals. Our goals are often safe and cushioned because we fear failure. We have been seduced to thinking flying lower is safer than flying higher.\nRule 6: You must be willing to share your unique ideas with the world, don't be repressed by conformity.\nRule 7: Don't Rulebound Yourself. Ozan writes, \"Research shows we become increasingly rulebound as we grow older. Events begin to rhyme. Days begin to repeat. We repeat the same overworn soundbites, stick to the same job, talk to the same people, watch the same shows. It's choose-your-own-adventure book that always has same ending. Our processes are developed in response to yesterday's troubles, if you don't question it  will impede forward movement.\"\n.\nThink Like A Rocket Scientist is published by Penguin Random House\n#books #book #pandemic #2020 #bookstagram #bookstagrammer #booklover #bookaddict #booknerd #bookreview #booksofinstagram #bookworm #bookgram #booklovers #selfhelp #rules #life #work #think #mind #instamood #insta #newnormal #pandemic2020 #instagood","NumberOfLikes":8,"Hashtags":["#1","#books","#book","#pandemic","#2020","#bookstagram","#bookstagrammer","#booklover","#bookaddict","#booknerd","#bookreview","#booksofinstagram","#bookworm","#bookgram","#booklovers","#selfhelp","#rules","#life","#work","#think","#mind","#instamood","#insta","#newnormal","#pandemic2020","#instagood"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Nona Walia on August 20, 2020 tagging @penguinrandomhouse.

This was generally seen as the model for a peaceful reunification with Taiwan, the island to which the Kuomintang government fled in 1949 after its defeat at the end of the Chinese Civil War. Given that Taiwan has now developed its own national identity (only 35% of people have a favourable opinion of China and a majority of young people would favour permanent separation - even if it leads to war), the prospect of a peaceful reunification is all but dead. A careful analysis of China\u2019s past geopolitical actions leads to conclude that Beijing does not hesitate to use force when the risk\/reward calculation is favourable. The probability of a forceful reintegration of Taiwan has thus increased now that China has less to lose (the world and Taiwan are progressively turning against it) but more to gain by turning Taiwan from a barrier to its power into an unsinkable aircraft carrier that would resoundingly assert its ability to project its power into the Pacific - as well as add to its economic and technological potential. It also helps that this shifting calculation is occurring at a time when America is more divided than ever before in its modern history (unrest is widespread and will only escalate with the upcoming election) and the world is seriously distracted with the pandemic that is wreaking both sanitary and economic havoc. Reasserting control over Taiwan just in time for the centenary of the foundation of the Chinese communist party in 2021 would be President Xi\u2019s crowning achievement. Given that 2020 has been such a terrible year for the world, let\u2019s hope that this scenario does not come to pass - otherwise 2021 could turn into an even more catastrophic year, marking a major conflagration that could lead to World War III ????","NumberOfLikes":16,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Patrick Kedemos - Big Ideas. in Taiwan.

I\u2019ve always enjoyed writing my thoughts because it\u2019s therapeutic, so I figured why not be brave and just blog! (This pandemic has given me a lot to process!!)\n\nHonestly, it\u2019s been a roller coaster of emotions. 2020 is a year we will never forget but won\u2019t want to remember.\nI know everyone has a different opinion about the pandemic (among other things) however, the reality is that people are dying.?\nIn fact, recently my daughter\u2019s grandmother passed away from COVID, (her funeral was Monday), yesterday we confirmed my mom has tested positive (she is sick but seems to be progressing ???).\nI pray and have faith she will recover.\nWith that said... it\u2019s frustrating to that people refuse to do their part in order to potentially save a life.\nPeople are protesting about wearing a mask, closed gyms, and salons. Life is not what we want it to be, we miss going out, hanging out with friends, vacations, shopping, playgrounds, etc. (I can relate, I\u2019m sure we all can!)\n\nBut, have you asked yourself:\nWould I feel the same if I lost a parent? a sibling?, a child? Or a friend? How would my life change?!\nUnfortunately as humans we are stubborn, at the slightest inconvenience we kick and scream. Some won\u2019t learn until tragedy hits home. Some tragedies we can overcome... but death is not one off them. Be considerate of others even if you don\u2019t believe or care about your own life. Anyway, I know we are all over talking about corona virus but it weighs real heavy in my heart because people I know have died.???? my condolences to anyone who has lost a loved one or is dealing with hardships and grief. \n#1stblogpost #bittersweet #bittersweetblog #pandemic #covid19 #blog #mood #staysafe #dontbeselfish #thankful","NumberOfLikes":2,"Hashtags":["#1stblogpost","#bittersweet","#bittersweetblog","#pandemic","#covid19","#blog","#mood","#staysafe","#dontbeselfish","#thankful"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Andrea Victoria (Drea) on August 20, 2020.

(Yes, Mama, I had on my N95 mask.) I was working as fast as I could so I could get back in the house. I noticed that I had ash on my arms and could feel it getting in my eyes. My glasses lenses were scattered with it. I noticed it on everything. I noticed that I couldn\u2019t see behind our property very far today from all the smoke. When I got in the house, I decided to take a shower to get the smoke and ash off of me, and I noticed that the top of my head had quite a bit of ash on it. Seeing that ash on my head, even more than when I was out in the yard, shoved me right into a reality I hadn\u2019t examined thoroughly before.\n\nAll I could think about was that people\u2019s lives were raining down and floating all around me\u2026 pasts, futures, hopes, dreams, plans, tiny pieces of homes and precious belongings, maybe even pets and other wildlife. And I couldn\u2019t help but think, \u201CPlease, no people.\u201D Whatever it used to be, it\u2019s all things that can\u2019t be put back together again. They can be replaced, some of it, but if you\u2019ve ever lost or broke something special, often times it\u2019s just not the same. I hear it said often in times like this, \u201CAt least they didn\u2019t lose their lives.\u201D In an obvious sense that is 100% true, but it\u2019s also not true at all \u2013 when we work so hard for the things we have, the places we live, the things we cultivate and that are precious to us.\nCertainly I think it\u2019s a safe bet that the vast majority of us would not trade our lives for any of those other things, but it doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t hurt or isn\u2019t significant. It may even be life-changing and cause a domino effect of other hardships.
