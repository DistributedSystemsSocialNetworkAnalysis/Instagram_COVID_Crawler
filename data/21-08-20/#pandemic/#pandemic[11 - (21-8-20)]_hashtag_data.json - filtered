Of many collective sufferings. The gap between flexibility and timeliness, and opportunism is huge yet invisible. Call for pandemic writings (is necessary, but unnecessary to this extend). The call for black artist is absolutely important but ridiculous to see how insincere and performative some curators and institutions are. The calls for BIPOC artists and studio visits are great, but not when they take the shape of \"giving  opportunity to you poor little things\"! This has become more present than ever. Who is caring and who is under the camouflage of care? \nArt world has more problems than solutions. More issues inside than the outside, and too many unhealthy relations to be unveiled. When do we  talk? Wanna hear the BIPOC? GIVE THEM FUCKING PLATFORMS. Want diversity? HIRE THE GODDAMN SMART ONES TO LEAD THE INSTITUTIONS, TO TEACH IN ACADEMIA, TO GIVE  TALKS. Want progress? DON'T FOLLOW THE TRENDS. LOOK FOR NEW VOICES.\nIt is not about \"giving the opportunity\", it is about FAIRNESS. About equality and inclusiveness. Be open to criticism and less offended. Art history shows how poorly the artworld has always reacted and it continues to happen. Since when art has become about self-censorship and  cautiousness? \n\nOh, and  please don't  use the word UNDERREPRESENTED to invite an artist to your show. You either like the work or you don't.

Many people find that their lifestyle automatically adjusts itself after some time due to the inner changes brought about by the practice. Many unwanted habits simply drop off. Whenever you realize that you have a bad habit, however, and it is within your power to give it up, you can actively do so. It is in your best interests to root out imperfections of character. For this, remain receptive to your conscience and to criticisms from others. When you try to change yourself, but there is inner resistance, there is no need to force that change. Instead, sit quietly at bedtime and heartfully pray for contentment and for the removal of flaws. Often, your heart naturally begs for forgiveness. Tears during prayer are the sign of sincerity, and it is the sincere heart that invites transformation.\n\nThe environment in which you live and the people with whom you associate influence the way your personality is designed. Inner attitudes and habits also play a major role in designing your destiny. As you continue to do the daily Heartfulness (@heartfulness) practices, the everincreasing simplicity and purity of the heart will start to mould your life.\n\nLearn to meditate at Heartfulness.

To help you become more tolerant and accepting of uncertainty, the following steps can help:\n\n1. Identify your uncertainty triggers. Reading media stories that focus on worst-case scenarios, spending time on social media amid rumors and half-truths, or simply communicating with anxious friends can all fuel your own fears and uncertainties. \n2. Recognize when you feel the need for certainty. Notice when you start to feel anxious and fearful about a situation, begin to worry about what-ifs, or feel like a situation is far worse than it actually is.\n\n3.  Allow yourself to feel the uncertainty. Instead of engaging in futile efforts to gain control over the uncontrollable, let yourself experience the discomfort of uncertainty. Take some slow, deep breaths or try mindfulness meditation to keep you anchored in the present.\n\n4. Let go. Respond to the what-ifs running through your head by acknowledging that you\u2019re not a fortune teller; you don\u2019t know what will happen. All you can do is let go and accept the uncertainty as part of life.\n\n5. Shift your attention. Focus on solvable worries, taking action on those aspects of a problem that you can control, or simply go back to what you were doing. ? You can learn to purposely focus your attention on the present through mindfulness. With regular practice, mindfulness can help change your preoccupation with future worries to a stronger appreciation of the present moment, as well as help calm your mind, ease stress, and boost your overall mood.

If you'd like to capture your family\u2019s experience in pictures, \u2060I'm booking documentary sessions for families that want to preserve memories of this unique time in history -- done safely, of course.\u2060\n\u2060\nAt first, most of my clients think their daily life is too boring or too messy to be photographed, but I promise moments are always happening, and I\u2019m an expert at capturing them. The beauty of a documentary family session is that there\u2019s no posing involved. Kids can just be themselves. No standing still and saying cheese. It\u2019s so much easier than stressing about everyone looking perfect at the same split-second.\u2060\n\u2060\nMy 1-hour documentary family sessions cost $350. Just DM me for a consultation or call\/text 970-426-6888. We\u2019ll discuss what family activity you\u2019d like to capture, make a plan you\u2019re comfortable with, and schedule a time.\u2060","NumberOfLikes":48,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by valmosley in Fort Collins, Colorado.

By nature, we want anything that doesn\u2019t please us to disappear. If you think differently from me, I want you out of my life, and preferably out of existence. This is the natural thinking of every person, to various extents. But nature didn\u2019t endow us only with this nature; it also gave us the ability to think and choose.\n\nNature endowed us with the ability to observe and to learn that nothing exists unless its opposite supports its existence. Planet Earth, for example, is kept in orbit thanks to the balance between the Sun\u2019s gravitational pull toward it, and the centrifugal force that pushes it away from it. Likewise, our lives revolve around the hours of darkness and light, and our vision relies on the range between seeing all the colors together, creating the color white, and no colors at all, creating the color black. Heat and cold, hunger and fullness, attraction and rejection, love and hate, all those are opposites that make our lives what they are.\n\nThe opposite of our lives don\u2019t deny or refute one another; they enable and complement one another! If we could only realize that as it is in all of reality and as it is with us, so it is with our fellow people, imagine what an inclusive, welcoming world we would have. Imagine what richness we could experience if we could embrace the diversity of people\u2019s colors, races, beliefs, penchants, perspectives, and everything else that makes us different, yet complementary.\n\nImagine also what a dull and stagnant world we would have if everyone were the same. We wouldn\u2019t develop thinking since we would have no need to articulate a point of view. We wouldn\u2019t develop imagination since nothing would stimulate or intrigue us. We would lose our creativity, vitality, and the zest for life. In fact, we owe even our fierce hatred and the delight of indulging in self-righteousness to the fact that there are people who are different from us. What would we do if they did not exist?","NumberOfLikes":96,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Kabbalist Dr. Michael Laitman on August 18, 2020.

I started my work day early to end in time to give them an hour at the ocean (their absolute favorite place on earth).\n\n#mamabear #proudmama #ocean #newengland #connecticut #shortbeach #motherofmultiples #daughters #bathingsuits #summertime #outside dirt #pandemic #covid19 #quarantine #quarantinelife #athome #workfromhome #commuter","NumberOfLikes":63,"Hashtags":["#metronorthrailroad","#mamabear","#proudmama","#ocean","#newengland","#connecticut","#shortbeach","#motherofmultiples","#daughters","#bathingsuits","#summertime","#outside","#pandemic","#covid19","#quarantine","#quarantinelife","#athome","#workfromhome","#commuter"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":13,"Timestamp":1597794528,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 19 01:48:48 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"yourbelovedeveee","CaptionText":"Psalm 32:10-11 ?\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n- \n\n-\n\n- \n\n#bible #biblequotes #trustgod #godisgood #godfirst #christian #christianity #lifestyle #confidence #selflove #love #selfcare #naturalbeauty #loveyourself #explorepage #explore #followforfollowback #followme  #pandemic #instagood #photooftheday #beautiful #art #happy #blessed #masterpiece #womeninspiringwomen #womanofgod #faith","NumberOfLikes":43,"Hashtags":["#bible","#biblequotes","#trustgod","#godisgood","#godfirst","#christian","#christianity","#lifestyle","#confidence","#selflove","#love","#selfcare","#naturalbeauty","#loveyourself","#explorepage","#explore","#followforfollowback","#followme","#pandemic","#instagood","#photooftheday","#beautiful","#art","#happy","#blessed","#masterpiece","#womeninspiringwomen","#womanofgod","#faith"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Eve ? in God Bless You.

The blood vessels leading to the higher reasoning part of your brain constrict. The body is starting to act as if you are under physical attack.

So we are left with a very ancient part of the brain which is an all or nothing, survivalist part of us. Everything becomes super dramatic, and it feels like the end of the world. It is in these moments that we need to soothe ourselves and bring ourselves back to earth, so that we can think things through and ensure that we are connected to our heart, our intellectual capacity and our emotional intelligence. Sometimes that means that you need to take a bit of a holiday, or scale back on your work, or somehow slow things down so that your body can catch up and realize that you\u2019re not actually under physical attack.
