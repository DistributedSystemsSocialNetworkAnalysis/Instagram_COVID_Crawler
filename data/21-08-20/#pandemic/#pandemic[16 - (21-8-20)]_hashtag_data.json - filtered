Am I completely shocked that my husband and I can even stand to still be in the same room together? 100%. \n\nBut there are a lot of other emotions too. Fear. Uncertainty. Worry. Concern. The world in its current state scares the hell out of me. Not because I can\u2019t hold my own, not because I don\u2019t know how I feel about all of it (because I most certainly do). Not because I am afraid of sickness. I answer to a higher calling with all of that. I believe in the plan that He has for myself and my family. But I feel all of this because I don\u2019t trust other people. I don\u2019t trust their intentions. I don\u2019t trust their ability to communicate. I don\u2019t trust their ability to be empathetic. I don\u2019t trust their judgment. I have to mentally prepare myself to have a baby (with Mike alone in the room) and bring her into a world where common sense is not so common, and people thrive on hate & misunderstanding.\n\nThis weekend was necessary. Mike and I got some time to refocus and remember our priorities. To be reminded of the kids we were when we first fell in love, and look at each other as people, not just mom or dad or provider or babysitter. It was also a time for grace. To forgive ourselves for words we didn\u2019t mean, for yelling at kids who are just as frustrated as we are, and to look to the possibilities and what the future of our family holds. \n\nWe are #blessed. In every way. When we remember this time, I know it will be with pride because we made it through. We are ready for you baby girl\u2026 and we can\u2019t wait to see how you complete this family and steal our hearts. I pray that the never-ending love we have for you supersedes everything else in this crazy ass situation we find ourselves in.\n\n#gomezpartyofsix #babygirlgomez #onemoretime #janedoe #reflecting","NumberOfLikes":85,"Hashtags":["#pregnant","#pandemic","#blessed.","#gomezpartyofsix","#babygirlgomez","#onemoretime","#janedoe","#reflecting"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Alex (Aguirre) Gomez in Robert Mondavi Winery with @brittaniborenleach, @michaelthomas_11, @babycenter, @babylist, and @snuggle_me_organic.

I'm finally a member of @costco ! But something happened while I was there shopping for the first time with my new membership that humbled my whole experience. As I was leaving the store I decided to get a fruit smoothie because I was super thirsty as I had walked the entire store looking at everything with lots of ohh and ahhh. While in line I saw a man in front of me. Initially I thought he was with another person as I saw them talking but then he awkwardly stared at me until he said something along the lines of \"I'm really hungry, do you mind buying me a hot dog?\" . My immediate response was \"yes, of course\". He then thanked me and waited in line with me. He tried to explain his situation, he had lost his job because of the pandemic and was really struggling. That's when I realized his unkept appearance. Regardless of that, I told him I was sorry to hear about his situation but reassured him he was in no way obligated to explain himself to me. In that moment I saw relief in his eyes. I don't care who you are, if you tell me you are hungry on the Costco line I'm getting you that hotdog. No one should have to worry about their next meal, no one. I am not here to pass judgement as to what has lead you to be in this position. I think it's easy to say well he should do this or that, but we haven't walked in his shoes. We don't really know, do we? I was glad I was able to help make his day a little brighter and was reminded what a fortunate life I live. He thanked me again after we got the food and we went our separate ways. \n.\n.\n.\n#betheone #bekind #kindness #costco #adulthood #adult #growingup #life #struggles #bekindtooneanother #help #helpingothers #shopping #food #foodinsecurity #pandemic #lifestruggles #firsttime #blog #havecourageandbekind #community #hunger","NumberOfLikes":20,"Hashtags":["#betheone","#bekind","#kindness","#costco","#adulthood","#adult","#growingup","#life","#struggles","#bekindtooneanother","#help","#helpingothers","#shopping","#food","#foodinsecurity","#pandemic","#lifestruggles","#firsttime","#blog","#havecourageandbekind","#community","#hunger"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Nico on August 17, 2020.

It\u2019s become harder to feel hopeful, for many of us, because suddenly the events and things we want to look forward to have changed, have been postponed, or cancelled.

I know this may seem like its getting old when I say this but it\u2019s so freakin essential people. Exercise is THE BEST COPING MECHANISM PERIOD. Without it I guarantee I and many others around me would be depressed and anxious. Exercise helps me deal with life\u2019s shortcomings and improves the one and only vessel I will ever own. Exercise makes me want to put better foods into my body. \n\nExercise stimulates the release of endogenous opioid peptides responsible for changes in our mood, anxiety, and performance.\n\nExercise also triggers Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor(BDNF) that is like fertilizer for our brains. BDNF helps maintain the life and growth of our brain cells. Low levels of BDNF have been associated with depression, anxiety, poor memory and brain degeneration as seen in conditions such as Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia.\n\nExercise in moderate amounts also helps support your microbiome due to its stress reducing effects. Moderate Exercise increases the number of beneficial microbial species and enriches microbial diversity as well as enhanced short-chain fatty acid synthesis and carbohydrate metabolism that promotes the function of your intestinal lining thus improving the regulation of your immune system.\n\nI could go on and on and would put exercise as just as important as eating the right foods. It will help you become your best self. Little by little day by day add in just another minute of exercise. Many people exercise like they do diets. Being extreme for a bit then falling off the wagon. Exercise and eating what\u2019s right for your body are life-style changes you should slowly adapt to.

Gavai & Krishna Murari was hearing a plea filed by 11 students from 11 states, submitting that the decision to hold JEE and NEET exams in September 2020 at a time when the country was still fighting COVID-19 was \u201Cutterly arbitrary, whimsical & violative of the fundamental right to life of lakhs of affected students.\u201D\n\nThe petitioners submitted: \u201CLakhs of young students are likely to appear in the aforesaid JEE (Main) April-2020 and NEET UG-2020 exams in September, 2020. Meanwhile, COVID-19 cases are increasing in India at an alarming rate. The deadly pandemic COVID-19 has already affected about 20 lakh people in India & situation is worsening by every passing day. Conducting the aforesaid examination across India at such perilous time, is nothing else but putting lives of lakhs of young students at utmost risk & danger of disease and death.\u201D\n\nThe bench, while dismissing the petition, said that the postponement of exams will only put the career of students at peril if exams were not held, students will lose an academic year which will be a loss to the country.\n\nThe bench further pointed out that if demand was being made for resuming physical functioning of courts then \u201Cwhy can\u2019t exams be held by taking necessary precautions?\u201D\nSolicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for NTA, ensured the court that adequate precautions will be taken while conducting the exams.\n\nAdvocate Alakh Alok Srivastava, appearing for the petitioner, however, submitted that since the risk arising from the pandemic was still existing & other exams like CA & CLAT have been cancelled, NEET and JEE should also be cancelled.\n\nThe bench, however, said that it was not going to interfere with policy decisions of the authorities took on record SG Mehta\u2019s submission that exams will be conducted with adequate precautions.\n.\n#lawcutor\n.\n.\n#SupremeCourt #Delhi #NEET\n#JEE #EXAM #postpone #SEPTEMBER #students #COVID-19 #UG2020 #pandemic #disease #Lawcutor news #lawnews #legalnews #legal","NumberOfLikes":79,"Hashtags":["#lawcutor","#SupremeCourt","#Delhi","#NEET","#JEE","#EXAM","#postpone","#SEPTEMBER","#students","#COVID-19","#UG2020","#pandemic","#disease","#Lawcutor","#lawnews","#legalnews","#legal"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Lawcutor� on August 17, 2020.

Since March: \u2063\n\u2063\u2063\n? Everyone, including all of the students, wear masks.\u2063\n? Constant hand washing. \u2063\u2063\n?They have a strict no visitor policy. Not even parents! \u2063\n?The classroom sizes are limited to a max of 10 people\u2063\n?There is no intermingling between classes.\u2063\u2063\n?\u200D? They offer virtual learning as well so the overall in-person enrollment is significantly reduced. \u2063\u2063\n?There is no use of the indoor gym or play areas (only outdoor playgrounds.) \u2063\u2063\n? Sanitizing of each classroom at the end of each day. \u2063\u2063\n? Drop off is via carline only and parents are asked to wear masks as well.\u2063\u2063\n? There is a thorough screening procedure at drop off including temp checks and screening questions.\u2063\u2063\n? If you answer yes to any of the questions, you will be asked to keep your child home.\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nI realize that this school is private so possibly better equipped to handle this but I think seeing what a great job they have done can at least give us hope and bring back a little normalcy into our lives.\u2063 \n\u2063\u2063\nThis in no way means that I do not take this pandemic seriously nor did I make this decision lightly.

But really it wasn't that different! Everyone that came into our room wore a mask but I still felt like all the nurses and every single person that came into our room was so extremely friendly and wonderful! If your covid test is negative, you do not need to wear a mask during labor, at least at my hospital. I tried to wear one at the begining to protect myself but I couldn't breathe through the contractions very well with it so I took it off ?\n.\nVisitors aren't allowed, but trust me, this can be a hidden blessing ? I was extremely overwhelmed by visitors after giving birth to my first daughter. I hadn't even stood up yet (you can't for about two hours after giving birth) and people were begging to come in the room to meet my daughter. Then learning how to breastfeed with people wanting to come in the room\u2026.ugh. The short time you have in the hospital is so busy with all the different tests and screenings they do for your baby.  I really enjoyed having time with just my husband and our newest daughter.\n.\nWhen we got home I felt like I was recovered enough for my oldest to meet her. I think it would've been hard for my two year old to see me in the hospital and then have to leave and not see us for another night too. The nurses also told us they enjoy not having visitors allowed because they're able to really help their patients.�\n.\nAt my hospital they said we could leave after 24 hours. However, the doctor I talked to said she doesn't recommend that anyone does that. She said she doesn't like that they offer that as a choice. We stayed the full two days and I'm so glad we did! I couldn't imagine leaving earlier. \n.\n If you're expecting I hope this eases your worries about giving birth during a pandemic! It's really not that much different and it'll all be okay! ?\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n#pandemicbirth #pandemicpregnancy\n#pandemic #birth #postpartum #birthstory #girlmomtimestwo #secondpregnancy #momlife #babiesofinstagram #babygirl","NumberOfLikes":19,"Hashtags":["#pandemicbirth","#pandemicpregnancy","#pandemic","#birth","#postpartum","#birthstory","#girlmomtimestwo","#secondpregnancy","#momlife","#babiesofinstagram","#babygirl"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Courtney Wilson on August 17, 2020.
