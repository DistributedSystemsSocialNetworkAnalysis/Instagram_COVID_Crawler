Of course, I\u2019m disappointed and it was a huge blow to my plans. The news came to me earlier this week as a complete shocker, even though I should\u2019ve expected it. Clearly, they are bigger and more important things happening right now. Dieting and training hard for show and then not being able to complete my goal has to be one of the worst feelings. But, I completely understand why this had to happen. \n_\n I\u2019m going to keep a POSITIVE perspective, I\u2019ve had a successful cut this year. My coach @christopher.barakat mentioned that I\u2019m in a better position to put on MORE quality size, when I get the opportunity to debut on a bodybuilding stage.. So, the plans for now is to start reverse dieting and aim to add more muscle and crush a show in 2021!!

Mereka merasa integritasnya turun ketika harus patuh pada orang lain. Sifat-sifatnya yang seperti itu tentu dgn mudah mengundang perdebatan bahkan kemarahan orang tua.\n \nNamun, menurut Dr. Laura Markham, psikolog klinis sekaligus pakar pengasuhan dari Columbia University, AS, anak-anak tipe seperti ini harus mendapatkan perlakuan khusus dari orang tua. Dengan perlakuan yang tepat, anak-anak ini dapat mengontrol dan melatih kemauan kerasnya utk menjadi sosok yang berintegritas, optimis, bersemangat, berani, & tidak mudah terombang-ambing.\n \nMarkham memberikan tips bagaimana menghadapi anak berkemauan keras:\n\n1. Beri Pilihan\n\nBiasakan untuk memberi pilihan. \u201CJika Anda menawarkan pilihan, ia merasa seperti tuan atas takdirnya sendiri,\u201D ujar Markham. Misalnya saja saat Anda mengajaknya pergi berbelanja. Anda bisa katakan padanya, \u201CKita akan berangkat 10 menit lagi. Kamu mau siap-siap sekarang atau nanti?\u201D\n \n2. Tunjukkan Empati\n\nSaat anak berkemauan keras mengutarakan keinginannya, ia akan berusaha sekuat mungkin mewujudkannya. Ketimbang menentangnya, berikan empati padanya dan pahami perasaannya. Misal, saat ia ingin membawa mainan mobil-mobilannya ke acara makan malam bersama rekan kerja suami Anda. Anda bisa mengatakannya, \u201CKamu suka mainan ini dan berharap bisa memainkannya, kan? Pasti senang bisa memainkannya. Tapi kita pergi ke acara makan untuk saling mengobrol & beramah tamah, jadi kamu tidak bisa membawanya. Tapi, kamu tetap bisa memasukkannya ke dalam tas sehingga bisa memainkannya selama perjalanan.\u201D\n\n3. Biarkan Belajar Sendiri\n\nAkan sulit memberi tahu anak-anak berkemauan keras tentang suatu hal. Cara terbaik untuk memberitahu mereka adalah dgn membiarkan mereka mengalaminya sendiri. Misal, ketika Anda mengatakan padanya untuk tidak naik sepeda setelah hujan karena jalan lebih licin, bergelombang, & becek sehingga ia rentan tergelincir.\n\nBersambung ke comment?","NumberOfLikes":1,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ?PertemananShalihat Community? on August 16, 2020.

There was always a little bit of sadness inside my heart for those that were hurting and a little fire burning that wanted to fix everything. Feeling every emotion so deeply, reading the faces in the room - is everything okay? Is there something I can do to make it better? Having empathy for others is something beautiful & very painful. It\u2019s grieving my patients a little too long and replaying the tear-filled conversations of their loved ones in my mind - over and over and over. It\u2019s discharging a patient that made me smile thinking - what will happen to you now? And sitting with the uncomfortable truth of never knowing. \nIt\u2019s reality though, and I\u2019m still here for it.

As of now there are 169,000 Americans dead from Covid-19. We will easily surpass 200,000. IV vitamin C seems to help Covid-19, but oral vitamin C does not appear to do too much. I have been taking 1000mg at least daily and 4000 IU's of Vitamin D daily as well as Tumeric. Avoid Ibuprofen as it seems to make Covid worse and in general there are more deaths associated with ibuprofen than Tylenol.\n\n#vitamind #vitaminc #vitamins #pandemic #pandemic2020 #vitamindtherapy #herbalcures #herbalcure #homeopathic #homeopathicmedicine #herbalmedicine #tumeric #ibuprofen #tylenol","NumberOfLikes":18,"Hashtags":["#vitamind","#vitaminc","#vitamins","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#vitamindtherapy","#herbalcures","#herbalcure","#homeopathic","#homeopathicmedicine","#herbalmedicine","#tumeric","#ibuprofen","#tylenol"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597613687,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 16 23:34:47 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"nikkidanai","CaptionText":"Some of y\u2019all really need to digest this information #2020 #CoronaVirus #Pandemic #Stupidity","NumberOfLikes":1,"Hashtags":["#2020","#CoronaVirus","#Pandemic","#Stupidity"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Nikki Carter on August 16, 2020.

Recent floods have washed away everything including looms, cloth, and other weaving equipment.

We believe this is the right time when Menka should tell the stories of these weavers who fought against all the odds to survive in-between these unprecedented times.
