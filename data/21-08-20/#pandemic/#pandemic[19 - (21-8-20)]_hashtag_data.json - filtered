The reason for that is that with the pandemic a lot of things related to music changed for me. The fact that almost all events got cancelled hits me very deep in my heart. ? Of course I know that these times will pass and better times will follow. And don\u2018t get me wrong - I know that all regulations regarding the pandemic are fully legitimate as health is the most important thing right now for all of us. ? But still - I would lie if I said that it was easy for me. \nI hope you understand that. \nIt means the world to me that you are still here with me, support me and listen to my music. ?

Alopecia = loss of hair. There are several different types of hair loss including androgenetic alopecia, alopecia areata, traction alopecia, trichotillomania, cicatricial (scarring) alopecia, and telogen effluvium. The type of hair loss we are seeing more due to the COVID-19 pandemic (and the physical and psychological stresses it brings) is telogen effluvium (TE). \n. \n.\nTE is a nonscarring hair loss due to increased shedding of normal telogen hairs secondary to a specific stressor. Normally, ~90% of our hair is in the anagen (or growing) phase of the hair cycle before it transitions to the telogen phase. The telogen (or resting) phase encompasses 10% of our hair, which typically lasts for 3 months. The hair is then shed. In TE, various alterations including pregnancy, malnutrition, or other stresses (surgeries, illnesses, medications, or emotional stress) cause an abnormally large number of hairs to enter the telogen phase simultaneously. The hair is then shed = increased hair loss. The stressor or event usually takes place 3 months prior to the physical hair loss due to the time spent in the telogen phase before shedding. \n.\n.\nThe good news is complete hair regrowth is expected as long as the stressor is removed.

And ever since I never wanted to miss a single match of yours. I remember waking up at 4 am in the morning just to see you at the toss when you were playing in England. During test matches, I used to sit all day long in front of the TV, waiting for your batting, or to see your wicketkeeping.\nIt was the final match of 2013 Champions Trophy, and I had a 100 mark exam the next day and still, I kept awake the whole night to watch the match, to see you playing and celebrating the win. (This was kind of a secret though, but thankfully my exam went well :P)\nFor me, cricket will be incomplete without you. It's impossible to forget how you used to 'finish' the games incredibly under immense pressure and stayed unbelievably calm, how you used to collect a stump after each winning match. And not to mention your \"Helicopter Shot.\"\nYour leadership skills, your captaincy, calmness, simplicity, the unbelievable sacrifices you made for your country, unique style of thinking, and above all, your patriotism has always amazed me and inspired me.\nThe day you suddenly said goodbye to Test cricket, I cried A LOT. After that I hoped that at least you won't shock us like this in one-day cricket. But you have your style :) Declaring the retirement in just two lines of Instagram caption.\nIt's very heartbreaking to think that we will never get to see you play in international cricket again.

So, the family had to take him to another hospital in Ayimgba, Kogi State. Due to the nature of the ailment, the family got a referral note and proceeded to Abuja, with the hope that he would receive better treatment there.\u2063\n\u2063\nSolomon recalled that a month earlier, when his father took ill, he went for a scan and the result showed he had an enlarged heart; the organ was retaining water. So, the doctors administered some medicine to help drain the water and asked him to check back in a month.\u2063\n\u2063\nHe narrated to The Guardian how his late father was rejected at three hospitals in the FCT on June 26, 2020.

Drop off some doughnuts to your local police station (no pun intended) Buy a cup of coffee and hand it to someone walking in or out of the hospital getting ready to start their shift or trying to keep their eyes open on the drive home.

If the virus had been genetically engineered in a lab there would be signs of manipulation in the genome data.\n\nThis would include evidence of an existing viral sequence as the backbone for the new virus, and obvious, targeted inserted (or deleted) genetic elements.\nBut no such evidence exists. It is very unlikely that any techniques used to genetically engineer the virus would not leave a genetic signature, like specific identifiable pieces of DNA code.\n\nThe genome of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of other bat coronaviruses, as well as those of pangolins, all of which have a similar overall genomic architecture. Differences between the genomes of these coronaviruses show natural patterns typical of coronavirus evolution. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 evolved from a previous wild coronavirus.\n\n Some scientists have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may have come from another known bat virus (RaTG13) found by researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The genomes of these two viruses are 96% similar to one another.\n\nThis might sound very close but in evolutionary terms this actually makes them significantly different and the two have been shown to share a common ancestor. This shows that RaGT13 is not the ancestor of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nIn fact, SARS-CoV-2 most likely evolved from a viral variant that couldn't survive for a long period of time or that persists at low levels in bats.\n\n#bats #batvirus #pandemic #pandemic2020 #virus2020 #virus #covid #covid19 #scientist #sci #pharmsci #pharmacyblog #pharmacyawarness #pharmacist #pharmaclass #sarscov2 #sars #epidemic","NumberOfLikes":16,"Hashtags":["#bats","#batvirus","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#virus2020","#virus","#covid","#covid19","#scientist","#sci","#pharmsci","#pharmacyblog","#pharmacyawarness","#pharmacist","#pharmaclass","#sarscov2","#sars","#epidemic"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597591789,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 16 17:29:49 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"edwin_h0623","CaptionText":"\"Tapi gue percaya apapun yg gue lakuin sekarang ini bisa jadi berkat dan rejeki nantinya\" - Anonymous\n\nDenger kata-kata di atas dari temen bikin semangat untuk hadapi kondisi ini.\nDi kala pandemi ini semua kegiatan dan kebiasaan berubah total.\nKondisi seperti inilah kita harus bisa untuk berdaptasi.\n\n? : @faidzessa_rivaldhy\n\n#pesentation #habits #work #blessed #grateful #pandemic #adaptation","NumberOfLikes":73,"Hashtags":["#pesentation","#habits","#work","#blessed","#grateful","#pandemic","#adaptation"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Edwin Handoyo, S.Ds. in Living World,Alam Sutera.

A corner of my mind was thinking the same when I came out for travel despite the pandemic norms. A feeling of guilt was there but the excitement and joy arising out of the decision was way too much. So much so that I almost forgot what kind of situation we are in. Under different circumstances I would have been overwhelmingly happy without feeling guilty.\nIsn't that why we travel in the first place to forget our loss and find ourselves? My defence mechanism kicked in. It's indeed a magical feeling, for a moment there I mean for a long time it made me forget the situation and focus on what's ahead. After a long while I felt that good. Don't know about others but this quarantine\/pandemic along with work and personal life had made me feel worse than I ever did.\nSo while I was thinking about this or for the short moment when this thought struck me, I saw on my left side. To give some context I was at Vasai Fort (you can Google it later). As I saw on my left side there was this wall and some sun rays penetrating through some presumed tree branches \u2014 just by looking at it, looking at goddamn sun rays, my heart felt heavy and I felt so good after a seemingly long while.\nWas it wrong to go out despite the pandemic? Yes.\nWas it worth the risk?
