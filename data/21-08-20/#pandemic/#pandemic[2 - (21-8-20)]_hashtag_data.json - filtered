It isn't all bad (laundry, cleaning, the NEWS) - I'm trying to get my Non-Profit theater @shtarkcontrast off the ground with fundraising, publicity, and our upcoming #Zoom production of \"By Candlelight\"  Sept 10th. Heartfelt play about Sept 11, 2001 that is also prescient.\n.\nSpeaking of which, my first review is the #paultremblay gem #SurvivorSong. It's #pandemic #novel to be surest, but that's merely the backdrop to a more intimate tale. Tremblay is an engaging, intelligent writer with a gift for realistic dialogue no matter how bizarre his imagined (and yet, completely plausible) worlds, are. Highly recommended!!! ?????\n\n#Horrorst�r by #GradyHendrix may seem like a work of horror fiction, but anyone who has ever attempted to assemble an Ikea bureau will know it is factually correct. \n.\nBut seriously, this book is so clever in its construction and conceit that I overlooked the gore and non-stop last minute saves that dominate the plot. The characters interested me as did the quest for stasis, but the novel, itself, is the art here. \n.\nThe Other Mrs. Miller by Allison Dickson is, yes, another domestic thriller, and I listened to the audiobook version.  But wait, you may be thinking, why should I try another of this saturated genre? Well, if you like a voyeur plot twist taboo sex and muffins romp - check this out. You won't be disappointed.\n\n#MYPANDEMICSURVIVALPLAN #horror #horrorfiction #booknerd #bookreviewer #amreading #bookstagram #bookstagrammer #booklover #l4l #love #bookworm #bookrecommendations #tnrowbackthursday #recommendedreading #fun #yournextread #readthis","NumberOfLikes":38,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ?

Maybe it will. Maybe it\u2019s okay to not know.\n\nIt feels defeating to swallow this pill after the enormous effort I have put into working on myself and my mental health over the past couple of years. But I have to realistically accept that currently all of my usual supports and healthy coping mechanisms have been removed due to ongoing lockdowns. My daily life is not only challenging, it is excruciatingly exhausting with few rewards to balance any of it. Therapy can only guide you so far out of a slump when difficult circumstances are out of your control. \n\nThis past year and half has felt like a continuous series of losses that keep knocking me down, and I naively get back up believing I\u2019ll be fine. Adding the pressures of a global pandemic, restrictions, homeschooling, parenting three children with complex needs, grief, loneliness, breakups, rejections, questioning identity\/social standing, perceived failures, and more trauma than I can safely handle, has pushed me to my lowest point and made me doubt my mind and abilities beyond what is functional for a parent. And now I am just too tired to do it on my own. \n\nOf course it\u2019s okay for me to accept that I have done everything I could possibly do with the resources available to me and right now, I should and will accept a little helping hand back up. This is not a way out, but an assisted way through, and learning to accept help without shame has been a huge focus for me after all. \n\nSo here I go, taking charge of my own life and decisions that I can control.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#grief#griefandloss#youngwidow#trauma#ptsd#adhd#medicated#loss#pandemic#mentalhealth#mentalhealthstigma#support#help#movingforward#getthroughit#itsokaynottobeokay#selfcare","NumberOfLikes":38,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Jaz Gartner on August 20, 2020.","NumberOfComments":24,"Timestamp":1597969486,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 02:24:46 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Authentic ?? \n-\n-\n- ? @aribproduction \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\nMods\nLouvers: @ikonmotorsports\nWicker Bill: @kng_wraps\nStarlit Headliner : CHINLY on Amazon \nWrap : @skepple  @alwanwraps  _themodgarage\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n#RicaRockettT #RicasRoyals  #PicOfTheDay #MuscleCars #Wrapped #LadyDriven  #3pedals #Carporn #explorepage #follow #Mods #Pink #Marble  #dodgeofficial #thatsmydodge #dodgefamily #pandemic  #mopar #MoparOrNoCar #DodgeChallenger #Shaker #atlantacars #caraddict #houstoncars","NumberOfLikes":67,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Rica Jonae ??\u200D?? on August 20, 2020 tagging @challengerfam, @3pedalgang, @skepple, @dodgenation, @dodgeforum, @challengeroftheday, @challengers__daily, @challengersunlimited, @carlock.co, @aribproduction, @car_vs_car_polls, @challengerfansclub, @cargirlsociety, @alwanwraps, @dripscat, @dodgefamilyy, @vinyl_addictz, and @themoparclub.

I'm hopeful that if I can use a #sports analogy, I may be able to explain my position in a way that some people may be able to accept in a way that my hollering about #corruption doesn't achieve.\n\nImagine being a #PittsburghSteelers fan, and watching the team build and grow, gain the necessary experience and get great blocking up front. You watch your team win repeatedly, earning the best record they have in years, and sell out crowds at every game. In fact, they make it all the way to the AFC Championship Game, where they lose to the #NewEnglandPatriots (sorry, Pats fans, they're easy targets).\n\nIn the two weeks prior to the Superbowl, it is discovered the #Patriots cheated- they filmed the Steelers' coaches' signals, so they'd know every play. The cheating is covered by @jimrome and a few other sports shows, but not ESPN, not FOX Sports, not CBS Sports or the rest of the sports media. And the Patriots are allowed to go to the Superbowl anyway.\n\nSo the big game is billed and advertised: Patriots vs. the New Orleans Saints. You and all the Steelers fans put up a big stink that it should be the Steelers, not the Patriots. FOX and ESPN start covering the Steelers' fans outrage, but instead of holding the cheaters accountable, fans of other AFC teams are featured, belittling Steelers' fans as babies for not supporting the Patriots and telling you to get over it and support the Pats. \n\nNow, this analogy only goes so far, because the New Orleans Saints aren't going to unleash #mercenaries on #peacefulprotesters or mishandle a #pandemic, and I've never heard AFC or NFC teams' fans rooting for each other based on conference, but this does serve to illustrate how ridiculous it is to allow a cheater to continue as if they were the victor, and how ridiculous it is for people expressing outrage about cheating to be told to shut up and support the cheater.\n#ourrevolution #indivisible #wearethepeople #wearetherevolution #wearethe99percent \n#trump? #trumpsucks \n#votebluenomatterwho #votebluenomatterwhoin2020\n#votebluetosaveamerica??? #Democrat #democrats2020 #Democrats #bidenharris2020?? #joebiden2020 #joebiden","NumberOfLikes":2,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Jason Kishineff on August 20, 2020.

In May, Deputy Inspector Stewart Loo proposed the creation of an anti-Asian hate crime task force, hoping that through a dedicated team they could build a better rapport with the community.\n\nThe team includes 25 Asian American officers that speak a second language, Loo said. Not having to use translators will increase investigators' ability to develop relationships with victims and ultimately lead to more cooperation, he continued. Harrison noted that 4 of the 17 arrests were done with the help of the task force.\n\n\"This task force has been built and will continue to build trust and understanding between the #NYPD and with Asian New Yorkers,\" said Harrison.\n\nThe task force will be permanent, Harrison said, and other culture-based task forces may be considered in the future.\n\nWhen asked about why there wasn't a dedicated task force for #anti-Semitic crimes, Harrison said that this task force was put together because of Asian Americans' lack of reporting and cooperation with the police. Victims of anti-Semitic crimes work with the police in most cases, he said.\n\n\"Since January, before COVID-19 became a national crisis, Asian Americans in New York City have been targeted in unprovoked racist attacks. They have been berated while riding the #subway and #harassed walking down the street,\" said Thomas Yu, co-executive director of #AsianAmericansforEquality, in a statement CNN. \"We applaud the city's decision to create an Asian Hate Crimes Task Force, a move that is long overdue... \n(CNN)\n\n#newstheheadliner","NumberOfLikes":1,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by NEWS The Headliner on August 20, 2020.

August 13th  we celebrated with @onetoughlittlecookie her one year diagnose-aversary of Granulomatosis with Polyangiitus (vasculitus).\n\nHonestly huge parts of this past year sucked. There were set backs, tears, pain, and unexpected trials experienced all along the way. There were times I felt like we were clawing our way up from the depths of hell, hanging on by a fingernail.\n\nI hope I never have to see my child in the ICU on a breathing machine again and yet the covid19 pandemic makes that a very real, looming possibility. Sending my kids to school (or not) has never been as emotionally charged for me as it was this year. \n\nBut through all the heartache I still feel gratitude. I still have my daughter. She has persevered and is a fighter. We are surrounded by astounding, knowledgeable doctors, nurses and other Healthcare workers that we love. I have seen the kindness and goodness of others through countless acts of service. My family has grown closer and formed bonds that are tighter than I ever imagined possible. I have felt God's love for my family in both small and simple ways as well as mighty miracles. We are blessed. \n\nSo with faith and hope I look forward to more infusion days and many, many more diagnose-aversaries with my beautiful daughter.\n#havefaith #gratitude #diagnosisanniversary #kindness #granulomatosiswithpolyangiitis #autoimmunedisease #2020 #pandemic #vasculitiswarrior #vasculitis #infusion #infusionday","NumberOfLikes":44,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by MichelleConder on August 20, 2020 tagging @onetoughlittlecookie.

One of the most frustrating parts of the progression of this pandemic is the longer it draws on the more in the dark I actually feel. What is clear is that the effects of this virus are vastly different from patient to patient. For some it is deadly and for others they show no symptoms at all. As humans, I think we have this tendency to cling to any information we hear simply out of fear of the unknown. We want answers and right now we have few.

Currently, the vaccine is being developed by a pharmaceutical company, AstraZeneca, and Oxford University. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has stated that a deal has been made with the company, granting \"early access [to the vaccine] for every Australian\" if the clinical trial proves to be fruitful. The country has recorded 450 deaths due to the outbreak, most of which are concentrated in Victoria. And earlier this month, it declared a state of disaster, imposing strict lockdown measures after a surge in infection rates. Hopeful that the vaccines will be available by early next year, Prime Minister Morrison expects the vaccine to be made mandatory to not relive the destructive events imposed by this pandemic.

Sabrina is starting at a new school this year as a middle school English teacher in Shreveport, LA. As a single parent, she\u2019s facing the challenges of sending her kids back to school while she kicks off the new year. She gave us a little insight into how she\u2019s making it as a millennial mom during a pandemic.\n\nSabrina writes: \n\nI think parenting during a pandemic has been hard due to the lack of a routine and schedule. We\u2019ve always had a routine and a schedule and then all of a sudden we just didn\u2019t have anywhere to go and nothing to do. My kids didn\u2019t adapt well to online learning at home in the Spring. \n\nIt\u2019s also hard, because there are so many opinions out there about how I should parent, like should kids be out playing in the neighborhood with other kids? Should I send my kids back to school? \n\nWell, as a teacher myself, my kids have to go back to school so that decision was pretty much made for me.

Whilst it may seem difficult to take a break with then returning to a high workload, we will actually be more productive after taking a break. If we don\u2019t (as I\u2019ve learnt recently), we become too tired to work, run down and end up sacrificing our personal lives or taking the stress out on our loved ones.

But I've noticed other 'nerds' (scientists) have been discussing and supporting Michelle Obama's speech for something different than what everyone else cares about; the ebola reference and getting it under control. So I just wanted to say something. As scientists we are constantly told not to 'get political' on matters that involve health and science, and to some extent that is true we shouldn't. When comparing ebola to this coronavirus pandemic we always cite the obvious differences like the fact that symptoms are more noticeable and less common, and that ebola did not spread as easily...but theres always an elephant in the room; that during the time of Ebola, the current administration listened to scientists and public health experts to set a better plan for how to get rid of it. Yes, it was politicized to some extent but that always happens. And the response wasn't perfect. But if politicians outright ignore the very people trained to handle these public health problems, thats making it political. We HAVE to 'get political' if politicians choose to use politics to ignore a public health crisis. Thats why so many scientists and public health experts now have been speaking out against this current handling of the pandemic...because we could have had it much better under control, could have had a lot less death and sickness, and we could have had less of an economic impact. Its the same reason climate scientists and ecologists speak out against politics; we have already shown science proves climate change is real, and gone much further in researching the details of the problem, who it affects, how much it affects them, and the safest way to go about causing less damage to our environment. But politicians back big corporations that have funded scientists to back them, paid scientists and leaders to back them, and cause most of the damage anyway.

While you are at it, add speech impairment to the list.\n\nNecessity they say is the mother of all inventions. A lot of the inventions that have been created for people with disability stems from mothers with special needs children. I have met mothers who have shown me the things they created to help their children perform one activity or the other.\n\nThere are many things I have done in caring for Nimi. I just have to keep thinking outside the box. Especially as I do not have a tree that grows money at the back of my house nor can I plan a successful money heist, I just have to improvise.\n\nIn teaching Nimi, I discovered that her style of learning is first visual then audio. She is a lover of anything animated. Thankfully, most of her slides from her teacher comes with animated videos. After classes, I google the topics on Youtube and play different animated videos. She enjoys it and she has a photogenic memory.\nIt was an amazing experience for me when I discovered how she could learn through audio. When she was much younger, she couldn\u2019t turn her head from her left to her right. So, if she lay on the play mat and her left side was facing the TV, she wouldn\u2019t be able to watch but I noticed that she could follow the cartoon that she was watching by listening attentively. She would laugh to appropriate jokes and understand when the cartoon has come to an end. However visual comes first for her. \n\nWith her school work, she enjoys most of her subjects but I noticed she wasn\u2019t responding to Yoruba and French. I called her school teacher and told her that I was not going to bother her with the subjects. I also told her that she could continue with the subjects when she gets back to school. In Art class, I was the one drawing and painting so I told the art teacher there was no point. When school resumes, Art class can continue. There is just so much this mama can do.\n\nCont'd in the comment section.","NumberOfLikes":20,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Special Needs Mum on August 20, 2020.

Before the world seemed to fall out from beneath my feet. Before freelance work almost entirely evaporated and projects, talks, assignments were all canceled. Back when we could hug and have tea at friends\u2019 houses and see people smile through more than just their eyes. Before hundreds of thousands of people died.\n\nBut to gloss over the past 4 months and write it all off as a loss would be a mistake. During this time, life slowed down. I breathed, tried to become grounded. Read a lot of books. Became close with neighbors and picked up my camera again after being sick for a long time. I re-connected with old friends, became closer with new friends, and talked for hours on the phone and FaceTime with people who make my heart full. \n\nOver the past few years of freelancing, I have been gone. A lot. Time zones blur and days at home are limited. Projects come up last minute and I miss birthdays, holidays, things I said I would be there for. But when work comes up, I travel. I am beyond grateful for this. \n\nBut it comes at a cost. And the biggest cost it seems is time with family. Sure I now feel guilt from not working on more stories locally and not being as productive as usual. But ever since driving up the east coast 2 months ago and arriving in Massachusetts with family, I can finally grasp that it is in fact July.\n\nUp here where I grew up, the seasons are more pronounced. The heaviness of the Florida summer is lifted. I know that it\u2019s July because the water is warm enough to swim in and take baths in a pink tub on the porch. Watermelon, strawberries, and corn are in season. Griffin eats corn on the cob with only 2 teeth and gobbles watermelon almost as fast as I do at only 7 months old. The tomatoes are big, but still green, on their overgrown vines and it\u2019s light until almost 9pm. Evenings are cool enough for a sweatshirt and as the sun sets, it brings on a tiredness only possible after a long day in and on the water. A deep, sun kissed sleep is the best kind. @monicaadler \n\n#pandemic #coviddiaries #family #yesiknowitsaugustnow #summer","NumberOfLikes":187,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":11,"Timestamp":1597956414,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 20 22:46:54 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#galaxy #galaxies,#nadanta #danceofshiva #bliss #life #live #nofear #pandemic #light #love #universe nargesnaghdi #music #rythmoftheuniverse #irresistiblebliss #irresistible #musiclovers #instadaily #instamood","NumberOfLikes":10,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597953106,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 20 21:51:46 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Y�ksek d�zey dezenfektan ? #dezenfektan #corona #pandemic #covid_19","NumberOfLikes":2,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1597574270,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 16 12:37:50 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Rik Walter as Dr. Ethan Drury.\n@rikwalter @frederic.michael \n\nAnnouncing Act 2: \"The Deception\" of CRAIGLOCKHART!

This time it will look different but it won\u2019t be different, I am determined to figure this out.\n\nThis year has been a year of growth for me, In November of 2019 I sought out a mentor and began working on myself and my business. I had just made some decisions on the direction of my business in early March and started implementing those decisions when the pandemic hit. \n\nDays after my business was ordered to shut down I found out I was pregnant. That was an adjustment on it\u2019s own, but it forced me to slow down even more so than I typically would have during a time like this. This new world we all entered was unrecognizable, I have learned to accept a lot that would normally be unacceptable. I have been angry, devastated, broken, and lost just like everyone else. \n\nI have made a choice now to be grateful, I have been reminded that I cannot let situations control me that I have no control over. I have the ability and opportunity to make decisions for my life and my future. Making those decisions makes me feel like I am in control again.\n\nThe big question is, what do I want the future to look like? I know it will not be the same as it was before and for that I have gratitude. Something needed to change and this quickly put those changes in motion for me. \n\nSo now I am starting from scratch...trying to not put pressure on myself to have all the answers and a clear direction at this moment. What I have decided is that wherever I end up it will be where I am supposed to be.","NumberOfLikes":129,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Megan Giaimo in La Crescenta-Montrose with @lamag, @spearmintbaby, @thebump, @american_salon, @buybuybaby, @beautylaunchpad, @womenontopp, @babylist, @esteticamagazine, @beauty.brands, @salonmagazine, and @happiest_baby.

Some of these are running for House seats again, while others have been promoted by the Democratic Party leadership and are running for the US Senate. And an entire new crop of military-intelligence operatives is being brought forward, some running for Republican seats targeted by the Democratic leadership as possible takeovers, others in seats not currently considered competitive.\n\nAs we explained in 2018, the extraordinary influx of candidates coming directly from the national-security apparatus into the Democratic Party is a two-sided process: the Democratic Party establishment welcomes such candidates as a demonstration of the party\u2019s unshakeable devotion to the interests of American imperialism; and military-intelligence operatives are choosing the Democratic Party over the Republican Party in large numbers because they are attracted by the Democrats\u2019 non-stop campaign against the Trump administration as too \u201Csoft\u201D on Russia and too willing to pull out of the Middle East war zone.\n\nGo to WSWS.org to read more.

And now they are threatening you with an eviction if you don\u2019t pay by the 26th, because @rondesantisfl edited the moratorium placed on April so that it only suspends \u201Cthe final action at the conclusion of an eviction proceeding\u201D which means that landlords can still do the whole process of an eviction and kick you out by the end of the month. \n\n40 million Americans are expected to be on the street in the upcoming months. And the fact that the government gives 0 fucks about that is truly infuriating. \n\nThis needs to be stopped NOW. Demand a freeze on rent! It is insane that this government expects people to be able to pay all their bills, rent, feed their families AND have enough savings all while being unemployed during a pandemic. \n\nI honestly don\u2019t give a fuck about myself. Ill be fine. But there are 40 million other Americans whose situation might not be the same.
