We will survive\n\nCatching some much needed sun vibes before donning PPE. I\u2019m just here doing what I do best. Keeping positive while nursing covid positive patients. It is one of the saddest times in my nursing career nursing the sick as they die without their loved ones at the bedside. So many emotions fill my heart at the end of the shifts. It\u2019s truly heart wrenching, but as nurses we must go on with strength and courage to flatten this curve and serve others. It\u2019s not easy times but we must all focus on the positivity and embrace each and everyday we are gifted as our last day. Speak to each other in a way that if they died the next day, you\u2019d be satisfied with the last thing you said to them. \n\nWe must also nourish our own physical, mental, emotional and spiritual health. Be kind to yourself and reach out to others in need. \n\nThe future is in our hands to stop the spread of Covid. Have faith, believe in hope and love deeply connecting together for a common goal in taking care of others. \u2063\u2063We are all bound together in ways that can be invisible to the eye. There is a oneness to humanity that we achieve ourselves by sharing ourselves with others and caring for those around us. We have the ability as people to dig deep into our human values. All of our current actions have an impact on others and on society to stop the spread of covid to enable us to live again.\n\nMy closing wishes from what I\u2019ve learned in life are please don\u2019t wait for things to get better.

So what did I do ? ... took 45 minutes of my time to break down in its entirety why I told him No. From acknowledging the fact that he is a responsible kid, and in a different environment I would be inclined to say yes. I broke down racial injustice, from buying a bag of skittles to jogging for your health and well being... I fully broke down the aspects of the world we live in today. Not ideal conversation for an 11 year old, but because I am 1 of 3 parents immediately invested in his health and well being, when I talk to him, I address him as a man since based on his melanin he could be charged as one. \n\nI did all of that yesterday, just to get to less than 12 hours later ....

An absolutely amazing book that I had planned to start in May before I even knew a real life pandemic was coming.... the timing was perfect? Scary? Meant to be? This novel is 1400 pages (I read the uncut version and you should too) of excellency. Of good vs. evil at its best. We watch the world end due to a flu and we watch what happens after. King knows how to craft a tale and how to make you love his characters and fear for them. It\u2019s a horror novel but mostly it\u2019s a post-apocalyptic novel. So if you are bad with horror don\u2019t count this out. I want to talk of all my favorite characters but I don\u2019t want to spoil who becomes a main character so I\u2019ll keep it hush. Yes this book is a commitment and it will take you a while but the ride is so amazing you will be thankful. Long books are scary but you get that much more story and development and understanding of the characters. It makes you care harder and for longer. Don\u2019t let length STAND in your way and put this on your \u201Cto be read\u201D list! M-O-O-N, that spells FIVE STARS!!!

Does it go away on its own?\u201D Fauci definitively warned that, \u201CIf everyone contracted it \u2026 a lot of people are going to die.\u201D\n\nIn his understated way, Fauci spelled out the imminent danger of any policy of \u201Cherd immunity\u201D gained through letting the country or the world\u2019s population become infected with the virus. The current low end estimates of COVID-19\u2019s mortality rate given by the World Health Organization is 0.6 percent, and at least half of the population has to become immune to halt the spread of the disease in this manner. Taken together, this translates to a minimum of 23 million dead worldwide from the pandemic, including more than 993,000 in the US alone.\n\nAs Fauci put it, \u201CThe death toll would be enormous and totally unacceptable.\u201D The current death toll in the US is more than 171,000, along with 5.4 million cases, already a staggering figure. To achieve the minimum estimate of herd immunity would require a scale of death six times greater than the tally already taken.\n\nGo to WSWS.org to read more.

On 9th June 2020, I finally bought a mountain bike which I was planning since June 2018. Trust me I haven't thought of buying it for sports or as hobby. I switched my commuting mode from Motar bike and cabs to \"Bicycle\" because I am practicing and studying sustainable lifestyle. \nDue to lockdown, I decided to utilise my time and channelised my energy for a better mental state, I started exploring long distant places on my bicycle only. Below I am mentioning the benefits of riding bicycle, After 10 weeks of experience.. \n\n1. It's good for your Heart and Lungs, Cycling is the best aerobic excercise. ???\n\n2. Immunity !  Not only physical, it helps your mental health for your overall well-being. (Anxiety, Depression, Obesity, Insomnia, better metabolism and what not). ???\n\n3. If you chose it for your daily commuting, then it's eco friendly and good for environment. Reducing your carbon footprints for a better world #Sutainable ?\n\n4. Good for your pocket. It helps you to save money that you spent on fuel, cabs and buses. Better immunity means better health and wellness thus lesser expenses on medication and illness.?\n\n5. Efficient way of socializing in reality. Unlike social media friendship, it helps you to meet new and like-minded people. Qualitative friendship ! ?\nI have written an article on my wordpress page, you can read it for more details (check Bio or DM me for the link) ??\n\nSwipe for more photos ???\n#travellustnomad #cyclinglife \n@bhukkadbhopali_official \n...\n#travelphotographer #traveler #madhyapradesh  #fitness #lifestyle #fun #landscape #instagood #instapost #social #mentalhealth #anxiety #depression #weekend #igbhopal #wellness #sunday #outdoors #pandemic #covid19 #corona #goodnight #lpwvn #photography #nature #biking #adventure \n@strava @goproindia","NumberOfLikes":135,"Hashtags":["#Sutainable","#travellustnomad","#cyclinglife","#travelphotographer","#traveler","#madhyapradesh","#fitness","#lifestyle","#fun","#landscape","#instagood","#instapost","#social","#mentalhealth","#anxiety","#depression","#weekend","#igbhopal","#wellness","#sunday","#outdoors","#pandemic","#covid19","#corona","#goodnight","#lpwvn","#photography","#nature","#biking","#adventure"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":12,"Timestamp":1597506302,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 17:45:02 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"dudesomebodyslive2020","CaptionText":"Dudesomebodyslive2020 fell in love ?","NumberOfLikes":3,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597473316,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 08:35:16 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"ebjevents","CaptionText":"*Screenshots photo for both dress and venue inspo* ??","NumberOfLikes":59,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by EBJ Events in Estancia Culinaria with @thesalvagesnob, @starfishstudiosfl, @cassieinmiami, @weddingwire, @theknot, @eventsonabudget, @modernluxury, @estancia_culinaria, @howtheyasked, @mlweddingssouthflorida, @theknotrealweddings, and @literallyido.

Go back and identify how you got where you are. Were you sure when you started moving in that direction that you were supposed to? List all the confirmations and ways you knew.\n.\n2 Peace in the Eye of the Storm: Let the peace of God rule your heart. It is entirely possible for all hell to be breaking loose around you, but you to still have peace that you are where you are supposed to be, doing what you are supposed to be doing. One of the ways God leads is through peace. Do you have peace?\n.\n3 Wise-Counsel: What are your mentors, peers and those close to you saying? It is important to get godly, wise-counsel as you make decisions. Are they seeing red-flags that you haven\u2019t? Do you have a support system or are you operating as an island, all by yourself. Unity is a powerful force. Decisions (especially big ones) should be made with the support and agreement of your spouse.\n.\n4 Ask the Hard Questions: What are the probable pros if you keep going? What are the probable cons if you stop? What are the alternatives? Just like you should make all-in decisions to take steps forward, you should make all-in decisions to take steps out or back. When you look back, you don\u2019t want to say, \u201CI wish we would\u2019ve.\u201D\n.\n\"Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him and He will direct your paths.\" Proverbs 3:5-6\n.\nFriend, I'm praying for you and cheering you on,\nTiffany \n.\n{From blog link in bio}","NumberOfLikes":37,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by 3xSurrogate\u2022Speaker\u2022Strategizr in Frisco, Texas.

But merely the simple fact that you get to eat well, unlike many traditional colleges and universities where many agree the food is horrendous and unhealthy. Pictured here: is food I made while on externship for myself. I included lots of grilled food using a grill plan. I managed to cover most of the basic food groups of animal protein, lots of veggies, a starchy hasselback potato with rosemary and garlic butter\/oil, which was crispy and intensely aromatic. In the second photo my amazing roommate Aaron @chefaedavis , a baking and pastry major, but talented culinary chef, made me roasted chicken with lots of aromatic flavors like lemon, garlic, and plenty of herbs. It was super juicy. He also served it with roasted root vegetables. Many college students typically eat low quality food or don\u2019t have much understanding of eating well and cooking for themselves, but I had the privilege of eating like a king. Me and Aaron as roommates shared many homemade meals together, which is what food is meant to be.

I want everybody to see what our voices could do! The account was removed cause we spoke up. But it doesn't stop there, there were over 2000 followers of that account.
