I truly believe there's always something we can be thankful for and I hope my kids will grow up remembering that everything they have and are is because of God and that He deserves their praise.","NumberOfLikes":52,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by toomuchofakidthing on August 15, 2020.

Particularly in the rural areas public resources for antenatal and postnatal care, immunisation, treatment of acute malnutrition, among others have been diverted to contain the pandemic and the people are deprived of getting the basic healthcare facilities. \n\nWith that, the abrupt supply chain interruption due to lockdown, hoarding, and panic buying exponentially increased the on-ground challenges. During the initial phase of lockdown, there were instances of a shortage of face masks, personal protective equipment (PPE), and door-to-door food supply.\n\nDespite all these odds, resilience and tenacity of the Anganwadi and ASHA workers has enabled the government to proactively implement relief and health protocols. Anganwadi centres and functionaries have reimagined and rapidly equipped themselves with new skills to respond to a higher burden on public healthcare\n\nThe Anganwadi ecosystem has fostered the social cohesion by combating stigma & discrimination and have played a pivotal role in not just sustaining the primary functions of the system, but also in mitigating the COVID-19 crisis in rural communities. \n\nWith their daily door-to-door visits to identify suspect cases of COVID-19 to educate the community members about the fundamentals of the disease such as modes of transmission, common signs and symptoms, and high-risk groups (HRGs). They have done a commendable job in tackling the COVID-19 situation.\n\n#competition #giveaway #win #corona #independence #empathy #covid #contest #motivation #writing #fighter #warrior #heros #health #follow #repost #pandemic #art #instagram #participants #online #opportunity #covid19 #positivity #share #like #mycoronawarriorstory #15thAugust #footprints #follow_footprints","NumberOfLikes":31,"Hashtags":["#competition","#giveaway","#win","#corona","#independence","#empathy","#covid","#contest","#motivation","#writing","#fighter","#warrior","#heros","#health","#follow","#repost","#pandemic","#art","#instagram","#participants","#online","#opportunity","#covid19","#positivity","#share","#like","#mycoronawarriorstory","#15thAugust","#footprints","#follow_footprints"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by FootPrints on August 15, 2020 tagging @talester_ashish.

Practiced some patterns along with some relaxing music and sipping on my favourite lemon ginger tea. \n\n(A little story time below.) \n\nThe entire year has been a mess, but July 2020 has been extremely overwhelming. 2020 began with health issues, both physical and mental, quit my job and decided to take a break and focus on myself. Each day passed by with a lot of struggle, to accept the changes in my life, to move on and to heal.\n\nJust when I thought I was getting better mentally, my mind and body was slowly starting to be at peace with my anxiety and was slowly starting to get back to normalcy in this pandemic, the pandemic reached our home. With 9 people who tested Covid 19 positive from my husband's family, one of them being my mother in law, it was just too much to take mentally and physically. The whole month has been very overwhelming and also life changing. With my health issues back to back, my anxiety, my low self esteem, suddenly came a big responsibility. The responsibility of taking care of my family, our home and our extended family. Fortunately, with everyone's blessing and prayers, me, my husband and my father in law tested negative from the beginning itself and it's been almost a month, my mother in law is negative now and she is recovering along with the other family members. \n\nThis pandemic is for real and it does not only affect the person who is infected with the virus, but also the near and dear ones around. There was this constant fear of things going wrong, ensuring that utmost care was taken of the patient along with maintaining all precautionary measures. But this phase in life has taught me a lot of patience and has given me a lot of confidence as compared to how miserable I used to feel earlier. Never thought  that this would happen to us in real. But this phase has got me and my family together, closer and stronger. \n\n(Caption contd. in comment section)","NumberOfLikes":56,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1597489959,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 13:12:39 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"raw_satya","CaptionText":"New beginning ? it\u2019s a blank page. \n\nThe impact of the outbreak will force us into slowing down the pace, refusing to take planes, working from our homes, entertaining only amongst close friends or family, learning to become self-sufficient and mindful.\n\nJust how do you see the world changing?","NumberOfLikes":45,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Rosemarie Walmsley in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

Unsettling stuff. A ricochet of the subconscious, reeling behind the ceiling, manifesting in strange ways, here we come. Insomnia, brother, do you speak it? The first four days of #Liverpool, I did not sleep. I lay in bed terrified of sweet fuckall until the sun rose and I got up to work. It was rough.\n\nOn the 5th day, the Lord spoke to me and said, \"Hey buddy, you have valium in your bag.\" Oh yeah! That solved the problem and I've been running full fucking force forward ever since. The drugs work!\n\nIt helps that a city like Liverpool is built for me and only me. We had a good time! When I told my friends I was here, their reactions echoed in unison: \"What do you mean you've never been there before??\". My #LFC support aside, everyone knows I'm a terminal #Beatlemaniac and, baby, #Beatlemania still thrives in these parts. You can taste them in the air. A local called me rude when I labelled Liverpool as \"basically a #Beatles theme park\" so I won't do that again.\n\nSurely, there's more to life than The Beatles though? I guess so. Here's a list of 5 ideas:\n\n1. Liverpool people are the friendliest I've met in the #UK.\n2. There's some proper alternative fashion about!\n3. Drinks are cheap! At times, half-price #London.\n4. Liverpool leans hard left. Not a single Tory member is on the council and The Sun is banned from the city.\n5. It's way prettier than people give it credit. I expected roughness but nah. Good looking architecture, people, trees, water, everything. Safe vibes all over.\n\nIn summary: Liverpool gets the Jared stamp of approval. It's like the best bits of London extracted then fluffed into a smaller space. I would recommend it to literally everyone I've met.\n\nStill playing chess with the Universe, next game, I slide my bishop to #Edinburgh. I\u2019ve been here once before but I\u2019ve changed, the world has changed. Hey, what you gonna do with that COIVD card, God? I'm staying in a hostel this round so I'm definitely about to die.

However making the best of it like the rest of us... if we can. I know it\u2019s tougher on others and I\u2019m fortunate to be Canadian and even to have been able to go abroad earlier this year; nonetheless have work shut down but get to still eat, shower, watch Netflix etc. This has taught me not to take things for granted, appreciate a snail go up a leaf which I\u2019d usually ignore due to not enough time or utter impatience. I tried to make a baked good too, rare occasion for me. \n\nThis was my reaction to baking for the first time in a lonnnnng time during quarantine lock down. I got creative and used an African cream based liqueur I brought back with me which is actually made from fruit - you can buy it in Canada also. \n\nThe Marula tree has sap that is an irresistible nectar to animals such as monkeys and, as seen in the label, the elegant elephant- except for when they lick the said nectar which ferments in their stomachs and thus, intoxicating even these large creatures who perhaps didn\u2019t realize that this sweet treat would give them an unfamiliar feeling of being drunk. Unpleasant repercussions such as being hungover may seem hilarious but they fall over and wake up dehydrated like us. \nIt tasted really nice in my very first banana bread\/cupcake hybrid. I\u2019m not used to being in Toronto and not working. Not traveling is a huge deal. But, in retrospect... I never would have attempted baking otherwise. Miss you Africa and friends\n- this was self quarantine after nearly 30 days, the first month only. \n\n#isolationcreation #nocovd19 #quarantinelife #pandemic #bakingtherapy #amarula #liqueur #cupcakeideas #bananabread #staysafe #stayhome #staysane","NumberOfLikes":26,"Hashtags":["#isolationcreation","#nocovd19","#quarantinelife","#pandemic","#bakingtherapy","#amarula","#liqueur","#cupcakeideas","#bananabread","#staysafe","#stayhome","#staysane"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Tabytha Towe in Parkdale.

I know I\u2019ve been all hyped up on my son\u2019s homeschool but the end of week rush hit hard. By the end of the last lesson for the day, I was like balancing making dinner, housework and helping my son break down word problems. It\u2019s his first week of real school work since the whole pandemic started and has been so good all week. But towards the end he was over it too and started getting lazy. So we took some time and I called my honey. He totally called me out on being a strict Asian mom lol. I love how we balance each other out and call each other on our bs. He told me exactly what I needed to hear to put my mind back in the right space. By the time he got home we had the music blasting and back to being our weird-selves.

I write as a historian and as a citizen, concerned in both capacities with the growing lack of faith among many Indians in the functioning of the Supreme Court.\n\nLet me say straightaway that this is part of a wider degradation of Indian democracy, in which the court is by no means the central actor. Other (and possibly more serious) manifestations of this degradation are the politicisation of the civil service and the police; the creation of a cult of personality; the intimidation of the media; the use of tax and investigative agencies to harass and intimidate independent voices; the refusal to do away with repressive colonial-era laws and instead the desire to strengthen them; and not, least, the undermining of Indian federalism by the steady whittling down of the powers of the states by the Centre.\n\nI should also make it clear that this ongoing degradation of Indian democracy is not the fault of one party or one leader alone. Rather, these perversions of the democratic process were set in motion by the Congress party when it was in power at the Centre; and they have been further deepened under the rule of the Bharatiya Janata Party since May 2014.\n\nSource @thewirein\n.\n.\n.\n\n#india�#indianpolitics�#supremecourt�#judiciary�#independent�#independentjudiciary�#ramachandraguha�#historian�#academic�#letter�#anguish�#constitution�#overreach�#apathy�#apathetic�#cji�#cjibobde�#sabobde�#chiefjusticeofindia�#bjp�#bharatiyajanataparty�#ranjangogoi�#migrantcrisis�#fascism�#authoritarianism�#modi�#namo�#hindutva�#covid19�#pandemic","NumberOfLikes":75,"Hashtags":["#india","#indianpolitics","#supremecourt","#judiciary","#independent","#independentjudiciary","#ramachandraguha","#historian","#academic","#letter","#anguish","#constitution","#overreach","#apathy","#apathetic","#cji","#cjibobde","#sabobde","#chiefjusticeofindia","#bjp","#bharatiyajanataparty","#ranjangogoi","#migrantcrisis","#fascism","#authoritarianism","#modi","#namo","#hindutva","#covid19","#pandemic"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Aligarh Muslim University News on August 14, 2020.
