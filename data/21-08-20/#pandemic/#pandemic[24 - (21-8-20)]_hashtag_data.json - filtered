Se descubri� una estructura espec�fica de coronavirus en las c�lulas que puede ser un objetivo de estrategias antivirales muy necesarias contra esta familia de virus.\n\nLos coronavirus replican sus genomas en el citoplasma de la c�lula hu�sped.  Lo hacen transformando las membranas de la c�lula hu�sped en ves�culas peculiares  de doble membrana (DMV). El ARN viral reci�n creado debe exportarse desde estos DMV al citosol para empaquetarlo en formas infecciosas completas del virus.\nSin embargo, hasta la fecha, no se han detectado aberturas al citosol en los compartimentos de replicaci�n del DMV.  Aqu�, en busca de comprender c�mo se exporta el ARN viral de los DMV sellados, los autores utilizaron tomograf�a electr�nica para visualizar la etapa intermedia de la infecci�n de una c�lula por el coronavirus de la hepatitis de rat�n, utilizado en lugar de SARS-CoV-2 debido a limitaciones de bioseguridad in vitro. \nIdentificaron una estructura en forma de corona espec�fica del coronavirus, un poro molecular que abarca las dos membranas del DMV, que probablemente desempe�a un papel durante la liberaci�n de ARN del compartimento.\nEn un trabajo posterior utilizando muestras prefijadas de c�lulas infectadas con SARS-CoV-2, demostraron que la estructura tambi�n est� presente en los DMV inducidos por el SARS-CoV-2.\nEsta estructura puede ser un complejo gen�rico con un papel fundamental en el ciclo de replicaci�n del coronavirus, facilitando la exportaci�n del ARN viral reci�n sintetizado desde los DMV al citosol.\nAunque el modo exacto de funcionamiento de este poro molecular queda por dilucidar, sin embargo puede ofrecer un objetivo farmacol�gico general y espec�fico para el coronavirus.\n\n#coronavirus #COVID_19 #sarscov2 #pandemic #genomics #genetics #nanotechnology #biotechnology","NumberOfLikes":12,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Hans Landa on August 14, 2020 tagging @mayoclinic, @drveller, @medscape, @edusalud10, @thebiomics, @cochraneorg, @laselsevier, @biotech, @elseviermedicina, @biotechnologyguy, and @thenewenglandofmedicine.

Major European economies are the hardest hit, with France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom set to be decimated by double-digit negative growth for 2020.�\n\nCountries that have been through extended periods of full lockdown, as well as those who rely on international travel for their economies are also reeling from tragic consumption drops. Despite eliminating all COVID-19 restrictions for two months, New Zealand will still suffer dearly with -8.9% growth in 2020 due to the practical elimination of its two of its largest exports - tourism and international students, as well as nearly two months of lockdown that shut down most businesses and kept people at home.�\n\nHowever, the prediction for South Korea\u2019s economy this year can be seen as a shining triumph. It's on track for a 0.8% contraction on-year, which puts the country at the top of OECD countries, faring far better than the average of -7.5% growth for the \u201Crich countries club\u201D.\n\nAs the OECD report notes, the COVID-19 pandemic is a crisis \u201Cwithout precedent in living memory.\u201D Containing the virus remains a precondition for economic stability, and recent resurgences in Hong Kong, Vietnam, Australia and New Zealand have once again trampled hopes for economic recovery in the second half of 2020. Korea is not out of the woods either - today, it recorded at least 158 new cases in the Seoul Metropolitan Area, a supercity of 25 million, the largest number since March.\n\nClick the link in our bio to find out more about the OECD's latest economic outlook and the Korean economy's relative success during this time. \n.\n.\n.\n?: Asia Times\n.\n.\n.\n#economy #korea #southkorea?? #newzealand #recovery #covid19 #pandemic #recession #business #europe #oecd","NumberOfLikes":15,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by economicsbite on August 14, 2020.

These feral groups are most likely due to illegal release by breeders and\/or pet owners. \nI was reading in Journal of Wildlife Diseases that a few years ago in Maricopa County, groups of Rosy-faced Lovebirds were PCR-tested and researchers found Rosy-faced Lovebirds were largely infected with C. psittaci, a bacterial species and zoonotic pathogen. They hypothesized that congregation areas of these birds, such as backyard feeders, may be enabling transmission between them. Chlamydia psittaci can be widespread in bird populations, mammals, and can cause pneumonia in humans. Further reading in BMC Infectious Diseases suggested that because C. psittaci is not included in routine microbial testing, it could be underdiagnosed in humans. However, the research also suggests that evidence points to probable zoonosis from poultry including chickens, turkey, and ducks, instead of the widely reported parrot-like birds, such as the Rosy-faced lovebird. \nThere have been Psittacosis outbreaks in the past, including chicken slaughter houses in Virginia and Georgia in 2018, a veterinarian school in New South Whales in 2014; in England in 2015, workers contracted Psittacosis and it was traced back to feeding pigeons. In 1929-1930, there was a pandemic that was traced back to many sources relating to exotic bird trading. The outbreak occurred in many countries, including the US, and in California it was traced to the popular breeding and trade of Lovebirds.

Nothing personal. Prudence believed her as believability was a prime asset for news people, so she called her up but only got Sonja Delaney\u2019s secretary. \u201CCan you tell Ms. Delaney this is Prudence Obermeyer, and I\u2019m an oncologist whom she interviewed about a cancer cure a few years ago. I have a different story I\u2019d like to discuss. It\u2019s about\u2026\u201D She glanced at Dia, still uncertain how to really talk about the particle humans. \u201CIt's about a type of people with a certain condition who are under threat of mass murder. It\u2019s an urgent story. Please have her call me back.\u201D\r\nWhen Prudence hung up the phone, she said to Dia, \u201CI think we need to catch a particle human to show on television for people to take us seriously.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou can\u2019t let this one float away like the last one did.\u201D\r\n\u201COf course. We'll have to design an ideal container with air holes too small for them to float out of. We'll also have to find them. Where do you think they\u2019d congregate?\u201D\r\n\u201CThey like warn bodies, so anywhere people are.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat doesn\u2019t narrow it down and makes the whole ordeal seem more preposterous.\u201D\r\n\u201CWelcome to my world.\u201D Again, Prudence struggled not to roll her eyes.\r\n\u201CMy guess for the best place to hunt down some errant particle humans is in a factory or a dance hall. Those are the places with the largest number of hot and sweaty regular-sized human bodies who would pay a lot of attention to tiny people floating into their ears and noses. Boring grunt work like office work will do no good. They're still and silent and bored and cold too often to be proper attractors for particle humans.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat begs the question: which one should we go to, the dance or the factory?\u201D\r\n\u201CWhere would we stand out the most?\u201D They went silent.

I'm an empath and a light worker and am still on my healing journey. Today I had to speak with a Psychologist, different from my beloved regular licensed therapist, for a diagnosis for insurance purposes. The gentleman was more seasoned than I originally thought and the first (besides my therapist) to recognize my complex PTSD. I told him my story in the form of a Cliffs notes outline over a Zoom meeting. He tried, but could not fully contain his emotions\/expressions as he heard me list trauma after trauma I have survived. He said he could not believe how calmly I could share everything and praised the work my therapist and I have done together accordingly. He then encouraged yoga and meditation before I agreed they are helpful indeed and I am also a runner. I told him it was less than a year ago for me to get through a yoga practice without sobbing on my mat towards the end for emotional release. My journey has been arduous and yet I feel such validation and pride for my dedication to healing myself and breaking the chains of abuse and dysfunction in my personal lineage. After my meeting I had to jump right back into Mommy-Mode and go to horseback lessons and grocery shopping. Home to do the housework and pay bills. Into the shower where the tears began to pour. I can tell my story with ease, but my body, mind, and soul still carry the pain. So I release it through tears and will ask my husband and daughter for extra hugs tonight. Recognize that I need some extra love and support and once again tell little girl me- \"I am so proud of you! We did it. We made it. WE CHANGED IT.\"","NumberOfLikes":27,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Shiva Diyogi on August 14, 2020.

SPEAKING OF CONSPIRACIES THOUGH... Preventable diseases are making a comeback.  The WHO recognized anti-vaxxers  as one of the top 10 threats to public health. We may be laughing at the extremely privileged white moms that have no regard for anybody but herself and her own children...but lack of trust in public health is more widespread than that, especially in the Black community due to the terrible history of using poor Blacks to experiment on without proper consent. The medical community needs to regain that trust, just one of the many reasons both diversity AND inclusion is so important. Not just for Black health but all health. I think that historical broken trust is very valid and understandable and therefore repairable. Unlike many of the anti-vaxxer karens. Similar to how conspiracy theories work, they use whatever info that makes them 'right', and ignore any information that makes them 'wrong'. If you work in Healthcare and\/or research learn about the history of racism in medicine, and do not continue it. History repeats itself if we ignore these issues just because it makes us uncomfortable. #BlackLivesMatter #BLM #Racism #EndRacism #EndWhiteSupremacy #EndQualifiedImmunity #DefundThePolice #AbolishICE #EndPoliceViolence #EndPoliceBrutality #TamirRice #SandraBland #RefundCommunities #ShowUp #ShowLove #Love #Coronavirus #COVID #COVID_19 #COVID19 #pandemic #plandemic #conspiracytheories #conspiracy #misinformation #Research #Science #Medicine #ListenToScientists #WhitePrivilege","NumberOfLikes":33,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Paige Lemen on August 14, 2020.

As restrictions begin to ease up in various countries, event coordinators are attempting to find ways to kick start the industry again. On Tuesday SSD Concerts hosted the world\u2019s first socially distanced concert, which they have been planning since April, with headliner Sam Fender. The Concert took place at a UK pop-up venue, the Virgin Money Unity Arena, located in Gosforth Park in Newcastle, England. The venue is composed of five hundred raised platforms with a limit of five guests per platform, and around 2500 people attended Tuesday\u2019s event. To keep the guests as safe as possible the platforms were separated by at least six feet, concessions were ordered in advance, and cars were parked six feet apart so that guests could safely be ushered to their platforms. Following this huge success, SSD Concerts has planned multiple events for later this year including performances from several musicians and comedians such as Van Morrison, Jimmy Carr, and Bill Bailey.

This is on top of one million euro diverted to the Local Enterprise Offices in the three counties to help businesses, as well as a special tourism fund - worth another million to Failte Ireland - to promote the three counties as a visitor destination - once the lockdown has passed. All of this comes in the wake of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment still being paid to hundreds of thousands of workers who have been unable to work due to the #coronavirus #pandemic - which started at a fixed \u20AC350 per week per person up to July, before reducing in some cases to \u20AC208 - and which is tipped to cost the State over \u20AC2 billion by the time it ends (if it ends) in April 2021. You almost get the sense compliance is being bought - in order to have everyone go along with the restrictions; you also have to wonder how long more can the Exchequer throw money at the population and keep the economy turning over at the same time.\n\n#moneymoneymoney #everywhere #euros #millions #billions #grants #vouchers #incentives #government #state #exchequer #laois #offaly #kildare #pandemicpayments #compliance\n\n#art #sketch #dailysketch #drawing #digitaldrawing #graphictablet #paintbucket #illustration #editorialsketch #cartoon","NumberOfLikes":5,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Joan Geraghty in Westport, Ireland.

When I realised I wasn\u2019t getting anywhere with her, I resulted to carrot and stick method. I told her that if she didn\u2019t cooperate in class the next day, no TV throughout that day. On the other hand, if she cooperated, she would have her TV time and also a slice of cake, which is her favourite snack by the way. Like it is said in my native language, I did not kill my mother, so no child should kill me.\n\nThe next day was a lot better and the day after. She began to settle into her adjusted routine.\n\nIn the first week of virtual learning, she took only year one subjects and that was easy to follow. Luckily, the classes were very flexible. She had just two zoom classes a day while other classes were slides with additional animated videos for each subject.\n\nAfter one week, her teacher reminded me that she ought to take year two classes too. That was extra workload. The school planned it in such a way that year one classes were not clashing with year two classes so that parents who had children in both classes and didn\u2019t have enough devices could accommodate all the kids.\n\nIn a day, year one class had four subjects, which also included class work and home work. Literacy was divided into comprehension, creative writing, grammar and spelling. This also applied to year two work.\n\nMy work as Nimi\u2019s teacher starts at 9am and ends at 1:30pm or 2pm. When school closes for the day, we rest a little bit then we continue with her homework. By the time we are done, I am completely drained. Teaching a special needs child who cannot sit on her, use her hands and has speech impairment is not a walk in the park.\n\nEnsuring she is able to see the laptop screen is one thing that she sits well is another. Then she may get cranky and you just have to let her be. Take a little rest from time to time. There are times she won\u2019t accept her caregiver to sit with her and I will have to carry her and also teach. Her caregiver was still new and I am very particular about who teaches her.....Contd in the comment section.","NumberOfLikes":16,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1597440054,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 14 23:20:54 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"So since Cillian is a Doberman, he\u2019s considered a velcro dog.
