May the presence of God\u2014this very moment\u2014bring peace to your troubled soul. When anxiety surges and emotions swell, may you discern the source and grab hold of the truth. Sometimes the best thing you can do is to step out of your current frame of mind and do something altogether different. Dance. Sing. Watch a funny movie. Go for a walk. Better yet, worship Jesus with reckless abandon. You're not at the mercy of those moments. You don't have to stay there. So rise up from there and remember who you are. You'll get through the surge, and you'll smile again. You'll get to the other side and feel \"normal\" again. So don't let those anxious moments swallow up your day. You have tools in your toolbox. You have the living, breathing Word of God. And you have the Holy Spirit within you to guide you through every twist and turn of your journey. You'll get through this. \n\nPhilippians 4:6-7 (NLT) ~ Don\u2019t worry about anything; instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need, and thank him for all he has done. Then you will experience God\u2019s peace, which exceeds anything we can understand.

Today, we are passing through an exceptionally difficult time due to the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.\nIn addition to this, further problems confront humanity such as extreme climate change. I would like to take this opportunity to express my admiration and gratitude to governments across the world, including the Government of India, for the steps they are taking to meet these challenges.\nAncient Indian tradition describes the creation, abiding and destruction of worlds over time. Among the causes of such destruction are armed conflict and disease, which seems to accord with what we are experiencing today. However, despite the enormous challenges we face, living beings, including humans, have shown a remarkable ability to survive.\nNo matter how difficult the situation may be, we should employ science and human ingenuity with determination and courage to overcome the problems that confront us. Faced with threats to our health and well-being, it is natural to feel anxiety and fear. Nevertheless, I take great solace in the following wise advice to examine the problems before us: If there is something to be done\u2014do it, without any need to worry; if there\u2019s nothing to be done, worrying about it further will not help.  Everyone at present is doing their best to contain the spread of the coronavirus.  For those with no stable income life is a daily struggle for survival. I earnestly appeal to all concerned to do everything possible to care for the vulnerable members of our communities.  I offer special gratitude to the medical staff\u2014doctors, nurses and other support personnel\u2014who are working on the frontline to save lives at great personal risk. Their service is indeed compassion in action.\nWith heartfelt feelings of concern for my brothers and sisters around the world who are passing through these difficult times, I pray for an early end to this pandemic so that your peace and happiness may soon be restored.\nWith my prayers,\nDalai Lama","NumberOfLikes":24,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Rosemarie Walmsley in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

And don\u2019t pull a \u201CKaren\u201D on me and tell me you\u2019ve got it all figured out - because we all know, you definitely don\u2019t ?.\n.\nI have had my share of rollercoaster moments that have really tested my limits. So much so I just had to laugh at myself for freaking out a few times, because really - as long as we have our health and a roof over our head - everything else will work out and we will all be stronger for it.�(At least this is what I\u2019ve convinced myself lol).\n.\nSo many unknowns for our children. Can we do distanced play dates? Can we use the playground? Remote learning or in person learning? At the moment - I think no matter what option you choose for your children the bottom line is they are LEARNING and they\u2019ll have fun and learn something new. Children are resilient and they will bounce back and get through this all just FINE. Most of the time I feel we as parents stress ourselves out more than the kids.\n.\n- Breathe Mama - \n.\nI came across this verse from @scarymommy and it\u2019s so true \u201COftentimes the many things we do as mothers goes unnoticed. The hundreds of tasks we plan and complete in a day, the scheduling and worrying that normally wouldn't occur to anyone else.�\n\nThe non stop noise and the the indescribable relentlessness, selflessness and isolating exhaustion.\u201D\n\nIt can certainly feel invisible and draining. But remember you\u2019re not alone - we\u2019re all one big HOT mess.

We decided to drop by for lunch, having admired the bright and breezy exterior decor for so long.\n.\nFor starters a selection of roasted goats cheese (as photographed), bacon toast and soup were amongst a relatively well rounded selection. The goats cheese was rather strong, but expected non the less.\n.\nFor mains: a salmon fillet, the rather \"healthy\" choice in comparison to the various other items on the menu. There was a rather tedious wait between courses but it was a relatively busy and we just used this as an opportunity to take in the pleasent, airy and incredibly well spaced surroundings.\n.\nAfters followed which included creme brulee, crepes with a choice of toppings and sticky toffee (as pictured) pudding. The options were fairly standard, and the best part was the creamy ice cream.\n.\nThe staff were incredibly attentive, polite and hard working. The kitchen was based upstairs and food was brought down to be served by staff gallantly carrying trays up and down a large flight of stairs. We were thoroughly impressed with the cleanliness and inviting approach with the restaurant. Although the food was pretty 'standard' (perhaps forgettable) we enjoyed the rather relaxed vibe from the restaurant. I'm glad to have been able to tick this off my restaurant bucket-list ?\n.\n.\n#bistro #bistropierre #food #socialdistancing #foodie #foodiephiedlove #lists #yes #pandemic #keepsafe #fish #fishandchips #eatingout #clean #eatclean #protein #musclecars #muscle #abs #caloriedeficit #gymtime #legdayworkout #cheatmeal #everyday #cheatweek #fam #familyholidays #tabledecor #ppe #sanitizer","NumberOfLikes":8,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597924819,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 20 14:00:19 CEST 2020","Location":"Bistrot Pierre"}]
