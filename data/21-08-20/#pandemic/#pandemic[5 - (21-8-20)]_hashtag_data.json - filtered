Then, some time around 2013, while reading the book The Fault in Our Stars I came across the quote,�\u201CMaybe 'okay' will be our 'always'.\u201D It made me realise how significant that one word must have been for people. I may be wrong, but it definitely has been for me. And over the years as my fascination with words, books and literature grew I came to the realisation that one single, simple word, any word, can take on a pretty grandiose meaning for people or, in this case, generation. It's also interesting to understand how different people can interpret one word in multiple ways. Though it was said in relation to a romantic relationship Snape harboured for Lily, it can take on multitudes of meaning especially in terms of remembering and memory which is in essence why Snape said it too. Any significant memory, which I know I'll never forget, I attach \"always\" to it. Today this came back to me because well, when I'm remembering 2020 and its atrocities�30 years down the line, and someone asks me \"After all this time?\" \nMy only response will be, \"Always.\" ?\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#quotes #harrypotter #words #memory #2020 #pandemic #randomthoughts #blackandwhite #lettering #always","NumberOfLikes":14,"Hashtags":["#quotes","#harrypotter","#words","#memory","#2020","#pandemic","#randomthoughts","#blackandwhite","#lettering","#always"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Ushashi L on August 20, 2020.","NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1597924745,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 20 13:59:05 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"king1lyrical","CaptionText":"It\u2019s That Time Again People - @king1lyrical X @pop.plug Get Respect Remix My 3rd Song With Pop Plug.

I have shown her that right now she is the little squirrel climbing the tree and that she will grow and get to the top in time but some branches may get in the way! ?If I teach my children anything about life, it\u2019s Don\u2019t Give Up\u203C?It\u2019s so easy to throw in the towel when things get tricky. Growth mindset is all about recognising that those bumps in the road are part of the learning process. It\u2019s normal and very much the terrain towards success. \n. . .\nHere\u2019s 25 Ways to Develop a Growth Mindset:\n1. Acknowledge and embrace imperfections. Hiding from your weaknesses means you\u2019ll never overcome them.\n2. View challenges as opportunities.\nHaving a growth mindset means relishing opportunities for self-improvement.\n3. Try different learning tactics.\nThere\u2019s no one-size-fits-all model for learning. What works for one person may not work for you.\n4. Follow the research on brain plasticity. The brain isn\u2019t fixed; the mind shouldn\u2019t be either.\n5. Replace the word \u201Cfailing\u201D with the word \u201Clearning.\u201D When you make a mistake or fall short of a goal, you haven\u2019t failed; you\u2019ve learned.\n6. Stop seeking approval. When you prioritise approval over learning, you sacrifice your own potential for growth.\n7. Value the process over the end result. Intelligent people enjoy the learning process, and don\u2019t mind when it continues beyond an expected time frame.\n8. Cultivate a sense of purpose.\nDweck\u2019s research also showed that students with a growth mindset had a greater sense of purpose. Keep the big picture in mind.\n9. Celebrate growth with others. If you truly appreciate growth, you\u2019ll want to share your progress with others.\n10. Emphasise growth over speed. Learning fast isn\u2019t the same as learning well, and learning well sometimes requires allowing time for mistakes.\n11. Reward actions, not traits. Tell children when they\u2019re doing something smart, not just being smart.\nCont.??","NumberOfLikes":8,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ???. ?????? ????? in Balmain, New South Wales, Australia.

The BCCI needed a new title sponsor for the tournament after its original title sponsor, Vivo, a Chinese smartphone manufacturer,�suspended the contract for this year�following a public backlash against Chinese companies amid the ongoing Sino-Indian border dispute. Interestingly though, Dream11, too, has Chinese connection.\n\n??\n The sponsorship amount and duration?\n\nThe IPL governing council chairman Brijesh Patel confirmed to�The Indian Express�that Dream11 is the title sponsor of the 2020 IPL and the sponsorship amount is Rs 222 crore. The duration of the sponsorship is until December 31, which means that although the IPL would be played in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) from September 19 to November 10, if for any reason the tournament needs further postponement\/deferment, Dream11 would still be its title sponsor until the end of this year.\n\n??\nWho were the other bidders?\n\nThe BCCI invited the Expression of Interest (EOI) to pick the IPL\u2019s title sponsor this year. According to Patel, BYJU\u2019S and Unacademy were the other bidders apart from Dream11.\n\nIn 2018, Vivo acquired the IPL title sponsorship for Rs 2,199 crore in a five-year deal. Accordingly, the company was paying the BCCI Rs 439.80 crore annually. Dream11 has been awarded the title sponsorship for Rs 222 crore, which means that the BCCI would be getting Rs 217.80 crore less from the IPL\u2019s title sponsorship this year.\n\n??\nBut Dream11, too, has Chinese connection?\n\nYes, Dream11 has Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd as one of its financial backers. Last year, it became India\u2019s first gaming startup to be valued at over $1 billion. And the BCCI is stressing on the fact that Dream11 is an Indian company.\n\n#business#india#ipl#dream11#Bcci#2020#pandemic#sponsorship","NumberOfLikes":1,"Hashtags":["#busines","#indi","#ip","#dream1","#Bcc","#202","#pandemi","#sponsorship"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Startup + Entrepreneurship on August 20, 2020.

I wanted to create a quote that would be uplifting and use 2 colors at least for variation unlike the other designs. I adore red and realised that it goes extremely well with the two basic colors of all my designs: black and white. The dual design of \"red\/black font\" and \"red\/white font\" was born.\nMost of my ideas were impromptu without realizing that they were derived from my inner subconscious.\n\nLike this design whose answer came to me today. \n\nYou may know from my previous post that I've been struggling with my quarantine mental health recently. It was bad to the point I wasn't tending to my basic needs.\n\nBut, two three days ago things started to turn around. I had a great heartfelt voice call at night with my best friend yesterday. Previously, I watched a beautiful epic romantic movie, \"Out of Africa\" that made me feel a lot, both good and bad. It was therapeutic and I felt in touch with my vulnerable humane side. \nThe day before, I'd gotten news that I would finally receive a prize for a competition I'd won a month ago. \n\nToday, after days of deliberation, I finally reached the point where I decided that it was high time to change things now that I felt better and stronger. And, I did. Finally, I am taking care of my basic needs.\n\nNow, I feel better and hopeful. I still fluctuate between good thoughts and bad thoughts but at least I'm at a better place currently.\n\nI can proudly say QUARANTINE - I MADE IT THROUGH. \n\nI made it through the dreadful days and the horrible overthinking. I made it through the tough times of seeing friends be lucky enough to able to go outside (with protection OF COURSE) while I couldn't. I made it through the days I screwed up in work and beat myself up over it. I made it through the bad days of quarantine and I know I'll be able to make it through more to come. It'll definitely be very very very hard, but I have a goal and purpose to meet.","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1597915933,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 20 11:32:13 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"drlepora7","CaptionText":"Do you want to be the BEST Nextgen Modern Leader?\nClick the link.\nhttps:\/\/www.drleporacoach.com\/free-master-class-coaching-course\/","NumberOfLikes":2,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597915603,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 20 11:26:43 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"markbrett1912","CaptionText":"By John Katsilometes Las Vegas Review-Journal\nAugust 19, 2020...Las Vegas entertainment community gathers in solidarity on Strip \u201CEric Johnson holds a sign during an event to raise awareness about the plight of the local entertainment community caused by the pandemic...We the Entertainment Community of Las Vegas \u2014 WE\/EC Vegas in shorthand \u2014 is showing its solidarity Wednesday night with a car parade and walking\/standing demonstration on the Las Vegas Strip. https:\/\/www.reviewjournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/14107839_web1_WEB-KATS-WEECEVENT-AUG19-20.\n.\n.\nMy wife Michelle @wojbcarpenters & I will never forget debuting our productions of \u201CCarpenters Remembered\u201D & \u201CCarpenters\u2019 Christmas\u201D there in Las Vegas...the entertainment capital of the world!

It was the longest time being away from my family and friends and that was difficult. My feelings of loss, bereavement, isolation, frustration, sadness, happiness, appreciation and gratitude was poured into this painting. You might question how can one feel all those things at once but I did. At times I felt like I was falling into the darkness of the abyss but having hope gave me light in the darkness, like the gold in the painting. In midst of all the chaos I found time to reflect and appreciate all the things I took for granted like my health and well-being and time with my loved ones. I held on to hope and used this time to find myself and channel my energy into personal development and growth.

Health authorities in NSW said there were three COVID-19 cases recorded in South-West Sydney yesterday and another two who were returned travellers in hotel quarantine. The new figures came after Deputy Premier John Barilaro signalled he would go it alone in calling for the Government to loosen restrictions on the state's southern border.\n??\n\u2022 Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has been taken to hospital in Siberia after suffering symptoms his spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, attributed to poisoning. Mr Navalny felt unwell on a flight back to Moscow from Tomsk, a city in Siberia, and his aircraft made an emergency landing, she said. Mr Navalny was unconscious and was placed on a ventilator in an intensive care unit. According to Ms Yarmysh, he must have consumed something from the tea he drank in the morning. Mr Navalny, a lawyer and anti-corruption activist, has served several stints in jail in recent years for organising anti-Kremlin protests.\n??\n\u2022 After almost three decades, Australia's longest-running legal saga is at an end, after the West Australian Supreme Court approved the final distribution of funds to creditors of Alan Bond's Bell Group. The WA Government and the Australian Tax Office (ATO) are among those who will share in the spoils. Bell Group \u2014 bought by Bond from another WA billionaire businessman Robert Holmes a Court \u2014 collapsed in 1991, and the banks who had helped prop it up reaped $280 million from the sale of its assets.

I created & gave away my drawings to passengers in the carriage around me, acts of kindness which in the process starting conversations which raised awareness and reduced stigma for these conditions. I\u2019m proud to be an ambassador for @thebigdraw. I created my free drawings on the tube & Overground in London, the New York Subway System, California\u2019s Amtrak, San Francisco trams, BART and MUNI, and Singapore's public transport system.

At first glance, it seems like a dream. No travelling, lounging in pyjamas and the comfort of home and family while working. \n\nOnce you take a step back, however, you start to realise that there are many problems that come with WFH. People's experiences show that employees start to develop fatigue after looking at their screens for so long. Meetings with a large number of participants are inconvenient and don't feel the same as meeting face to face. There is always the concern of privacy and productivity. While many companies in the IT sector found it easier to switch to WFH, there are several occupations where it is necessary to find a way around online platforms. \n\nThe sudden change is bound to come with stresses and a whole bounty of things no one could have expected. So our aim is to see what exactly these difficulties might be and what people can do to solve them.\n#workfromhome #wfh #pandemic #selfcare #stress #psychology","NumberOfLikes":16,"Hashtags":["#workfromhome","#wfh","#pandemic","#selfcare","#stress","#psychology"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by @couch_turned_office on August 19, 2020 tagging @insighte.care.

In April, they lost 17.7 million jobs. But by July, their losses had swelled to 18.9 million,\u201D CMIE boss Mahesh Vyas noted in a recent post.\n\n\u201CWhile salaried jobs are not lost easily, once lost they are also far more difficult to retrieve. Therefore, their ballooning numbers are a source of worry. Salaried jobs were nearly 19 million short of their average in 2019-20. They were 22% lower than their level in the last fiscal year,\u201D the post said.\n\nThis is in sharp contrast to informal and non-salaried jobs, which have shown improvement during the same period, increasing to 325.6 million in July from 317.6 million last year, an increase of 2.5%, the post noted.\n\nAt the beginning of the lockdown, informal jobs \u2013 particularly daily-wage labourers, hawkers and small traders \u2013 were worst hit in April.\n\nMore in link in bio.\n.\n.\n.\n\n#india #indianeconomy #economy #lockdown #covid19 #coronavirus #gocoronago #pandemic #indiafightscorona #maskoff #unemployment #jobs #salaried #salary #formal #dataisbeautiful #data #statistics #disappointing #reliance #recession #entrepreneurs #investors #investment #government #governance #finance","NumberOfLikes":1808,"Hashtags":["#india","#indianeconomy","#economy","#lockdown","#covid19","#coronavirus","#gocoronago","#pandemic","#indiafightscorona","#maskoff","#unemployment","#jobs","#salaried","#salary","#formal","#dataisbeautiful","#data","#statistics","#disappointing","#reliance","#recession","#entrepreneurs","#investors","#investment","#government","#governance","#finance"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The Wire on August 19, 2020.

Ironically, it also became the chant of millions on the streets of India against the project of Hindu nationalism.\nEven as Arundhati Roy began to ask what lay between these two calls for freedom-a chasm or a bridge?-the streets fell silent. Not only in India but all over the world. Covid-19 brought with it another, more terrible, understanding of Azadi, making a nonsense of international borders, incarcerating whole populations, and bringing the modern world to a halt like nothing else ever could.\nIn this series of electrifying essays, Arundhati Roy challenges us to reflect on the meaning of freedom in a world of growing authoritarianism.\nThe essays include meditations on language, public as well as private, and on the role of fiction and alternative imaginations in these disturbing times. The pandemic, Roy says, is a portal between one world and another. For all the illness and devastation it has left in its wake, it is an invitation to the human race, an opportunity, to imagine another world. \n\n#Starmark #ArundhatiRoy #@arundhati433 #@penguinindia  #Azadi #Freedom #Movement #Pandemic #Kashmir #NonFiction #bibliophile #bookworm","NumberOfLikes":17,"Hashtags":["#Starmark","#ArundhatiRoy","#@arundhati433","#@penguinindia","#Azadi","#Freedom","#Movement","#Pandemic","#Kashmir","#NonFiction","#bibliophile","#bookworm"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Starmark on August 19, 2020.
