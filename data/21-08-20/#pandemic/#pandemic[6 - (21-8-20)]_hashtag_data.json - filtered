However, crowded #flights make social distancing difficult. Plus air #travel involves spending time in security lines and #airport terminals, which can bring you in close contact with other people.\n\nThe CDC and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) have issued guidance to help airlines prevent the spread of the coronavirus. As a result, most major airlines in the U.S. require that crews and #passengers wear cloth face coverings. To see what specific airports and airlines are doing to protect passengers, check their websites.\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has increased cleaning and disinfecting equipment and surfaces at screening checkpoints. If you haven't flown since the #pandemic began, you'll notice TSA officers wearing #masks and gloves, and practicing social distancing.\n\nTravelers may wear masks during screening. However, TSA employees may ask travelers to adjust masks for identification purposes. Instead of handing boarding passes to TSA officers, travelers should place passes (paper or electronic) directly on the scanner and then hold them up for inspection.\n\nEach traveler may have one container of hand sanitizer up to 12 ounces (about 350 milliliters) in a carry-on bag. These containers will need to be taken out for screening.\nFood items should be transported in a plastic bag and placed in a bin for screening. Personal items such as keys, wallets and phones should be placed in carry-on bags instead of bins. This reduces the handling of these items during screening.\nBe sure to wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds directly before and after going through screening.\n#covid19 #vacation #airtravel #fly #baltimore #bwi #dca #iad #transportation #airportshuttle","NumberOfLikes":7,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Borden Transportation in BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI) with @bordentransportation, and @bordenconsultinginc.

Most people infected will experience a mild to moderate respiratory illness, whilst others will show no symptoms at all. However for some the effects are severe and longer lasting.\n\nOur aim in this yoga programme is to play some role in aiding the process of recovery. By only requiring the use of mostly basic props and furniture, we have tried to make the poses as accessible as possible for everyone.\n\nThe programme was compiled thanks to advice and guidance from Abhijata Iyengar, Lois Steinberg, Gulnaaz Dashti, Stephanie Quirk, the IY(UK) Therapy Committee, IY(UK) teachers who have experienced the virus themselves, and decades of work by BKS Iyengar and Dr Geeta S. Iyengar in medical classes at RIMYI in Pune.\n\nSee the link in our bio to access the video and booklet, which are both freely available. Please consider donating a contribution towards this and future Iyengar yoga therapy resources ?\n\nThanks to all involved in creating the programme and to @adrienne_karmaspaceyoga for designing the e-book\n\n#iyengaryoga #yogatherapy #covid19 #covid_19 #coronavirus #recovery #covidhelp #yogaforhealing #yoga #mypandemicsurvivalplan #sarscov2 #pandemic #pandemic2020 #staysafe #virus #postcovid #yogapractice #loveyoga #yogateachers  #iyengarmethod #yogadaily #practiceyoga #yogisofinstagram #yogajourney","NumberOfLikes":3,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by #learniyengar on August 19, 2020.

For a while, it seemed America wanted teachers to be frontline workers and I was NOT down with that. I love my students, I do so much to provide for my class, but now is the time to prioritize myself too. I was worried to say that for the longest time. I was concerned it sounded selfish and disconnected. However, if I\u2019ve learned anything thus far, teachers do not give themselves the self-care they need! It is only my second year teaching and I admit, it feels like starting the first year all over again. Our district decided on distance learning until Jan. 4, and I feel very relieved. I can teach from home and not risk my life. At the same time I am anxious, stressed, scared, uneasy, and stuck. Distance learning is HARD, and that\u2019s saying it lightly. It is not the same as being in-person with your students and watching them grow. Yet, it is crucial right now and exactly what is needed to slow this virus. \n.\nI\u2019m learning to embrace these feelings as okay and normal. Change is hard for me and the next couple weeks involve a LOT of it. Being a teacher, survivor, person with mental health, and teaching students with behavioral needs is a whole whirlwind, but SO rewarding. I am also reminded that in this pandemic, there is collective trauma happening and many of us have similar feelings. It\u2019s a reminder that I\u2019m definitely not alone. \nSo... Here\u2019s to new students, a new year, and a whole lot of learning for all of us. Gotta breathe and embrace as much as I can. If you know a teacher, be sure to give them a little extra love. We are definitely embarking on uncharted territory. ?\u200D?\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#teachersofinstagram #spedteacher #distancelearning #behavioralhealth #behaviorteacher #newschoolyear #letsdothis #pandemic #anxiety #ptsd #mentalhealth #covid19 #realtalk #teachersfollowteachers #positiveenergy #school #teaching #teachingfromhome","NumberOfLikes":25,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1597894958,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 20 05:42:38 CEST 2020","Location":"Portland, Oregon"},{"CaptionText":"Protest of the day (today: Aug 19,2020) Entertainment workers are over the rona. #weareentertainment #lasvegas #lasvegasstrip #SOUNDON #pandemic","NumberOfLikes":92,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":6,"Timestamp":1597894835,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 20 05:40:35 CEST 2020","Location":"Las Vegas Boulevard"},{"CaptionText":"????? ??? ?????? ?? ????? ??? ????? ????? ???? ?????? ????? ???? ? ??? ???? ?? ?? ????? ? ?? ???? ? ?? ??? ?? ??? ?????? ???? ??? ????? ?? ???? ??. ???? ???? ???? ????? ?????  ????? ???????? ? ????? ????. ???? ?????? ? ?? ?? ??? ???? ?? ?? ??? ?????. ????????? ???? ????? ?? ??? ??? ???? ?????? ?? ?? ??? ????? ?? ??? ??? ????? ?????? ?????? ????\n.\n.\n.\n??? ??? ????? ?? ??? ???? ???? ??? ?? ????? ????. ???? ????? ?? ??? ???? ??? ???? ?? ??? ????? ???? ??? ???? ?? ????. ???? ????? ??? ??? ???? ??? ??????. ??? ?????? ???? ?????? ????? ????? ??????? ??? ????? ????????? ????? ? ????? ???? ?????. ??? ?????? ???? ?? ???? ???? ?????? ?????? ????????? ???? ????. ??????? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ??????. ???? ????? ???? ????? ?? ?? ??? ?? ??????? ??????? ???? ???? ????? ???? ?????? ? ????? ??????? ???? ?????? ???? ????..\n.\n.\n??? ????? ???? ?????? ????? ??? ??? ???? ?? ????. ??? ???? ???? ??? ???? ???? ? ? ????? ?????? ?? ??? ??????? ?? ??? ????? ???? ????? ???????\n.\n.\n??? ?? ??? ?????? ?? ??? ???? ?\n\n.\n.\n#nature #naturelovers #naturelover #pandemic #???? #?????? #????? #??? #?????? #???? #positivevibes #travel #sheisnotlost #girlstraveler","NumberOfLikes":211,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Mer-Ce-deh in Tallahassee, Florida.

Due to the current climate\u2014the best chance to stay healthy is by helping your immune system keep working the best it can!�Many of you have concerns about what reopening schools will look like amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic. If that isn\u2019t enough to worry about, flu season is quick to follow.\nRead below for our top�proactive�suggestions to help you optimize your health! ??\n???\nThinking of getting the flu shot? Here\u2019s why you should.�While we know it is rarely perfect, the flu vaccine is safe, free (your tax dollars paid for it, so go get it!) and recommended for all Manitobans age 6 months and older.\n* The Flu Vaccine can STOP the spread of the virus (best case scenario \u2013 you don\u2019t get sick), or at least help your immune system with advance warning so that it can react quicker against the virus.\n* This means you may get less sick than you would have without the vaccine (shorter time, less likely to end up in hospital, less likely to die).\n* You can get your flu shot at your local pharmacy, public health clinics and your doctor.\n* Young children and older adults are at greatest risk for poor health outcomes but everyone is at risk.�\n* The flu shot will not protect against COVID-19 but the less your body is fighting other infections, the better off you will be if you are exposed to this or other viruses.\nIn addition to the Flu Vaccine, we recommend a strong focus on eating healthy, taking a multi vitamin as well as getting enough rest and exercise. If you're a smoker and able to quit smoking, now is the time. Think of the Flu Vaccine as the coach and your immune system needs to be healthy enough to follow the next play!","NumberOfLikes":13,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Cynthia Carr in Winnipeg, Manitoba.","NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597889299,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 20 04:08:19 CEST 2020","Location":"Winnipeg, Manitoba"},{"CaptionText":"Rewind 12 months ago.

This year, the Trust For Public Land rated Minneapolis as America\u2019s best city park system, in part because 98% of residents live within a 10-minute-walk of a park, like this one. Access to open natural spaces has been especially crucial during the COVID pandemic to allow for safe spaces outside our homes.\n\nBut as I\u2019ve learned recently, balancing nature with urbanity isn\u2019t just about city parks. It\u2019s also about \u201Ccity trees.\u201D This year I was introduced to @americanforests through my work with @eddiebauer and learned about their \u201CTree Equity\u201D program. Often in cities, trees are sparse in low-income neighborhoods and some neighborhoods of color. As American Forests points out:\n\n-Fewer trees mean more heat-related illnesses. Approximately 1,200 heat-related deaths and countless heat-related illnesses are prevented because of trees each year.\n-Communities with the highest tree cover needs tend to be those with the highest unemployment.\n-Increased emissions erode air quality. In 2018 alone, poor air quality was linked to nearly 10,000 additional deaths in the U.S.\n-Climate change fuels the spread of pests and diseases that kill or damage trees, as well as extreme weather events that uproot trees.\n\nAmerican Forests is currently developing a \u201CTree Equity Score\u201D of urban neighborhoods nationwide, so I\u2019m super interested to see where Minneapolis lands on that list compared to the @trustforpublicland ranking. I have explored every part of the city while training for my #RunAcrossMN and noticed the differences between neighborhoods, so am curious how we compare to others.\n\nFollow #TreeEquity and #Forests4Climate for updates on this project, along with jobs via the @americanforests initiatives.\n\nAnd next time you are running, biking, rollerblading, or whatever you\u2019re doing to get some fresh air during the pandemic, pay attention to the number of trees along your route.\n\n#FindYourselfOutside #EBContributor","NumberOfLikes":893,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Mikah Meyer in Boom Island Park with @trustforpublicland, @eddiebauer, @meetminneapolis, @americanforests, and @minneapolisparks.

According to the CDC, face masks are recommended as a simple barrier to help prevent respiratory droplets from traveling into the air and onto other people when the person wearing the mask coughs, sneezes, talks, or raises their voice. This is called source control. This recommendation is based on what we know about the role respiratory droplets play in the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19, paired with emerging evidence from clinical and laboratory studies that shows masks reduce the spray of droplets when worn over the nose and mouth. COVID-19 spreads mainly among people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet), so the use of masks is particularly important in settings where people are close to each other or where social distancing is difficult to maintain. However, many people still have doubts about the actual efficacy of wearing masks in the fight against COVID-19. Most who doubt are individual citizens, some are from the medical field and some are from the viral research field. They have their reasons, of which some of the often-mentioned ones will be discussed here.\n\nSee more : www.icloudhospital.com\n\n#wearamask #wearmaskornot #covid19 #corona #coronovirus #pandemic #pandemic2020 #virus #health #healthcare #cloudhospital","NumberOfLikes":6,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by CloudHospital on August 19, 2020.

We are doing it right for less! ?\n\n???????????\nEver since I met this man, all he's ever talked about is adding King Palm's to the property. Well, imagine our surprise when a neighbor called and stated there was one in a local Lowe's and discounted. Without hesitation, even being extremely #highriskcovid19, I looked at him and said \"You should go get it, let's all go!\" He was shocked I wanted to go. He wasn't aware I was secretly planning the purchase of Zinnia seeds for a new #microflowerfarm #project I've been planning. I'd also decided this trip WAS #essential. A necessity. I needed it. My #soul needed it.\n???????????\nFarming has now become my main #financial means. The #fitgirl now #farming! It was necessary for this man to get his King Palm, because the competitive #athlete in me didn't want anyone to score this win of a tree. I also wanted to see my King bring it back to life as it'd been sunburned as warned. This trip was also necessary, not because he wanted it - because his soul needed it. My soul also needed a bit of normalcy. My only normalcy through #Covid has been these two and my almost daily phone chats with my 22 year old @mysterbrandon. My 3 King's that have pulled me through this #pandemic.\n???????????\nThose who know me well know, I am (or was) ALWAYS on the go. I've worked 7 days a week for 15+ years. If I wasn't #training clients, I was #running #mountain #trails. Then my #life came to a screeching halt, like most, in March. Well I've had to trust and lean on my King Palm during a very burdened time. It wasn't easy for me making a shift to a slow way of life as I've done so fast. I have felt like a #football player hit hard and dazed. However, Matt has not only kept me striving ever upwards, he's kept me upright and strong, mentally, physically, and financially - just like a King Palm would.
