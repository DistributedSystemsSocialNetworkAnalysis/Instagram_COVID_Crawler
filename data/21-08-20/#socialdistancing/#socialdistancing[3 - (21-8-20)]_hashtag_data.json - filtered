This summer rent a houseboat on a lake, a sailboat on the coast, or a yacht in a bay. Spend your days swimming in the water, laying out in the sun, reading amidst the breeze, and enjoying a nightcap under the stars. Not only is it a unique vacation experience, but you're well away from others. Of if you prefer sleeping on solid ground, check out availability at one of MROP's resorts - many are near an ocean or a lake, and offer several watercraft available for rent!

When instead we ought to have been discussing alternate realities we wanted to build(as the promises of the nation).

The word \"Fentanyl\" only recently entered common usage, and yet it has become a looming presence in news reports and conversations across Canada. It is an opioid more powerful and pervasive--and deadly--than any previous street drug.\n\nOften those suffering are marginalized people. Consider that in 2003, the SARS epidemic killed 44 people in Canada and launched a massive mobilization of public funds and resources to contain the outbreak. Over 100 times that number have been killed between 2016 and 2017 during the opioid crisis in Canada. Yet, the response has been far from proportionate. In fact, our policies are making things worse.\n\nThe victims are many, and as we learn here, not only who we might expect. They are our neighbours: professionals, students, parents, and even health care workers. Despite the thousands of deaths, these victims remain largely invisible. But not anymore.\n\nBenjamin Perrin, a law and policy expert in Vancouver, BC--ground zero for the crisis--shines a light in this darkest of corners. What he finds challenges many assumptions about the people who use opioids, and the factors fuelling the crisis. Why do people use Fentanyl, where does it come from, and why can't we stop it? These questions, and many others being asked by all Canadians, are answered here in this urgent and humane look at the worst health crisis in recent history.\u201D Goodreads\n.\n.\n.\nReview in below comments.","NumberOfLikes":9,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by @gazebong on August 20, 2020 tagging @winnipegpubliclibrary, @penguinrandomca, @vikingbooks, @goodreads, @overdrive_libs, and @prhaudio.","NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1597963316,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 00:41:56 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#socialdistancing @longtabbrewing enjoying some pretty good beers #savetexasbreweries","NumberOfLikes":10,"Hashtags":["#socialdistancing","#savetexasbreweries"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597963352,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 00:42:32 CEST 2020","Location":"Longtab Brewing"},{"CaptionText":"Morning? at The Light Collection 1 for my first  training session of the day ?\n\nMuch more check it out now\nIm FreeLanceFitnessCoach MK.

Reservation apps are beneficial in multiple ways. \n\nFirst off, reservations allow for easier kitchen and staff management. When you know how many people you need to feed at a given time, you can better plan for your kitchen and waitstaff needs. This helps control traffic in and out of your restaurant when conducting outdoor\/patio dining?. \n\nSecond, reservations help elevate social distancing. Customers will no longer have to be waiting next to each other in a line or deal with unpredictable wait times. This can make customers feel more safe from catching any type of virus since they won't be waiting around anyone else until they are notified that their table is ready?. \n\nThird, there are numerous reservation apps that make taking customer reservations a breeze. Apps like these include Yelp, OpenTable, POS Notify, TheFork, and many more. Some apps are free and some come with a small cost. \n\nIf you aren't utilizing some sort of customer reservation method, it isn't too late to get started!.\n.\n.\n.\n#westcoastpos #customerreservation #reservation #reserve #restaurantreservation #socialdistancing #yelp #opentable #posnotify #outdoordining #patiodining #restauranttechnology #pointofsale #possystem #restaurantpos","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#westcoastpos","#customerreservation","#reservation","#reserve","#restaurantreservation","#socialdistancing","#yelp","#opentable","#posnotify","#outdoordining","#patiodining","#restauranttechnology","#pointofsale","#possystem","#restaurantpos"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by WestCoastPOS | Point of Sale on August 20, 2020.

Corporations can make a profit, be taxed, and can be held legally liable.\n\nCorporations offer the strongest protection to its owners from personal liability, but the cost to form a corporation is higher than other structures. Corporations also require more extensive record-keeping, operational processes, and reporting.\n\nUnlike sole proprietors, partnerships, and LLCs, corporations pay income tax on their profits. In some cases, corporate profits are taxed twice \u2014 first, when the company makes a profit, and again when dividends are paid to shareholders on their personal tax returns.\n\nCorporations have a completely independent life separate from its shareholders. If a shareholder leaves the company or sells his or her shares, the C corp can continue doing business relatively undisturbed.\n\nCorporations have an advantage when it comes to raising capital because they can raise funds through the sale of stock, which can also be a benefit in attracting employees.\n\nCorporations can be a good choice for medium- or higher-risk businesses, businesses that need to raise money, and businesses that plan to \u201Cgo public\u201D or eventually be sold.\n\nCompare the general traits of these business structures, but remember that ownership rules, liability, taxes, and filing requirements for each business structure can vary by state.\n\n#onlinebusiness #helpothers #millionairementror #businessowner #entrepreneurial #startups #entrepreneurspirit #homebusiness #startupbusiness #hardworker #successmindset #businesspassion\n#dreamers #selfgrowth #alwayslearning #ppploan #stayhome #socialdistancing #sba #sbaloans #pandemic  #WorkingFromHome #Lockdown #StaySafeStayHome #Covid_19SA #Coronavirus  #Covid19 #MyPandemicSurvivalPlan #FlattenTheCurve #businessopportunity","NumberOfLikes":2,"Hashtags":["#onlinebusiness","#helpothers","#millionairementror","#businessowner","#entrepreneurial","#startups","#entrepreneurspirit","#homebusiness","#startupbusiness","#hardworker","#successmindset","#businesspassion","#dreamers","#selfgrowth","#alwayslearning","#ppploan","#stayhome","#socialdistancing","#sba","#sbaloans","#pandemic","#WorkingFromHome","#Lockdown","#StaySafeStayHome","#Covid_19SA","#Coronavirus","#Covid19","#MyPandemicSurvivalPlan","#FlattenTheCurve","#businessopportunity"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by HG Solutions on August 20, 2020.

They were so good following the COVID guidelines. We had to book in advance and it gave us 3 hours to explore. We were able to go around as much as we wanted during that time. Unfortunately the outdoor play area was not open and they no longer had butterflies in the rainforest. We still had a fantastic time. Over 11s are to wear masks in the rainforest area. It was fairly warm but not uncomfortable at all. Was lovely to be able to explore together and it not be busy. Last time we went  before this there was a lot of waiting behind people but because of the covid guidelines we had so much time and space to explore at our own pace. We also took advantage of the kids pack. One of the activities was  rainforest bingo. We ticked off each creature and plant when we saw them. Was also lucky to find one of the sloths hiding in the greenery above us. There was hand sanitiser available all around and arrows labelled a route for us to follow to ensure social distancing was followed as best we could. Really recommend you take a visit. Even Elsie enjoyed it. I say that. She slept for most of it ?
