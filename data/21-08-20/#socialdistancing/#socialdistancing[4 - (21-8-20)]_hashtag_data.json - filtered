This is why on The Hub, you will not see any reviews on site itself. We will be encouraging customers to visit Indie Deck Review and utilize the work that has already been done by their team.\n.\nMany of our products will have been reviewed by IDR so we will be including those links in the description where possible.\n.\nI'm also excited that Amanda and her team will be posting their services in order to provide guidance for other creators and artists. While the basic review will still be free....they can also assist with writing, proof reading, in-depth reviews, consults, promotions �etc.\n.\nIf you haven't checked out their account or the site, please do so. They post reviews, crowd funding projects, new releases and more!\n.\nThis joining of our visions has been such a great experience and I have learned so much from Amanda...including different types of decks, correct terminology, real world representation etc. There is just so much to know!\n.\nThank you again for the support!!

Here we hold a half kneel position with a USB banded press-out. The goal is to resist rotation while holding a low level lunge position. This helps to strengthen and condition the anti- rotators of the core and hips by simply resisting the pull of the band.\n.\nStep 2: Dynamic. With this USB chop to lift. We now add a rotational movement with the chop that adds more difficulty in the rotational plane and lunge position, with the same benefit but with more of a challenge due to the added movement.\n. \nStep 3: Integrated. With the USB Reverse Lunge to Chop to Overhead Lift. We now integrate a rotational movement to an actual lunge. Again we are strengthening and conditioning the anti-rotators of the core and hips, both required to optimize your lunge.\n.\nStep 4: Ballistic: We now progress to the final movement, the Ultimate Sandbag Max Lunge. This is the most challenging and most functional. We now are creating and resisting power in the rotary and anti- rotary plane. This is an expression of how fast you can use the strength developed from the first three steps, function and transfer to the real world.\n.\nThis sequence allows optional performance and function and because of the quality developed, it creates a metabolic effect that stimulates more fat loss.\n.\n\n#fit2thecore #strongwoman #moms \n#momswholift #women #fatloss #dads #dadswholift #mom #strongmoms #fatloss #socialdistancing #dvrt #ultimatesandbagtraining #mobility #busymom #busydad #busywoman #busywomen #female #femaleprofessionals","NumberOfLikes":13,"Hashtags":["#fit2thecore","#strongwoman","#moms","#momswholift","#women","#fatloss","#dads","#dadswholift","#mom","#strongmoms","#fatloss","#socialdistancing","#dvrt","#ultimatesandbagtraining","#mobility","#busymom","#busydad","#busywoman","#busywomen","#female","#femaleprofessionals"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597949484,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 20 20:51:24 CEST 2020","Location":"Alamo, California"},{"Owner":"sugarmummy5632","CaptionText":"#sugarfree \n#sugarweddings \n#sugary \n#loveyourself \n#sugarpaste \n#sugarfree \n#sugarbabies \n#socialdistancing \n#wwe \n#sugarwars \n#summer2020 \n#sugardaddyneeded \n#sugarlife","NumberOfLikes":4,"Hashtags":["#sugarfree","#sugarweddings","#sugary","#loveyourself","#sugarpaste","#sugarfree","#sugarbabies","#socialdistancing","#wwe","#sugarwars","#summer2020","#sugardaddyneeded","#sugarlife"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @sugarmummy5632 on August 20, 2020.
