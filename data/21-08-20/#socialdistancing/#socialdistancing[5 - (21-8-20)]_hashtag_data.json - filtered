Westcliffe is a very small town nestled against the mountains with a population with about 700 people. What makes this place unique is its 1 of only 9 certified dark skies in the world. So when I say you can see the stars you can SEE the stars. I\u2019ve been trying to get people to visit this town with me for YEARS. Even while already there a quick trip wasn\u2019t in the cards . I finally had a crew that was down for the trip and the wait was well worth it I can promise you that. So if you ever want to feel like a tiny speck of dust, get lost in the vastness that is our Galaxy and be in awe 10\/10 I recommend you pay a visit to the small town of Westcliffe. The only downfall is we didn\u2019t get to capture our own images with the equipment we took. Not for a lack of trying though. So here is a pic from the porch of our cabin that I grabbed from the Airbnb listing. Yes it looks like that. The longer you let your eyes adjust the more vibrant the stars and details become. Definitely was the recharge and break from life\u2019s drama I needed. ?? #socialdistancing","NumberOfLikes":110,"Hashtags":["#socialdistancing"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by DJ Playboy in Westcliffe, Colorado.

Please note: Social distancing and masks will be mandatory at this time in line with state guidelines and health officials. Patrons can also set up a private viewing anytime in the next two weeks to see the show in person during our regular hours. The show will also be made available online through still images and a video walk-through of the gallery on our website as well as on the mood room IG and FB pages.

The masks in Venice, Italy, like these, have been modified to be more exaggerated, with a longer break than the originals. Mask-making is a fundamental art form in Venitian culture.

Unfortunately this does not change the level of risk and our ability to minimise this and therefore we will have to keep the piers closed for the time being.\n\nWe will keep this under review and, as soon as it is safe to re-open the pier for public use, then we will do so.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#PortofTyne #coronavirus #covid19 #covidsecure #NorthPier #SouthPier #TynemouthPier #SouthShieldsPier #TynemouthLighthouse #lighthouse #SocialDistancing #PiersClosure #SouthTyneside #NorthTyneside #Tynemouth #SouthShields #NorthEastEngland #blueskies","NumberOfLikes":28,"Hashtags":["#PortofTyne","#coronavirus","#covid19","#covidsecure","#NorthPier","#SouthPier","#TynemouthPier","#SouthShieldsPier","#TynemouthLighthouse","#lighthouse","#SocialDistancing","#PiersClosure","#SouthTyneside","#NorthTyneside","#Tynemouth","#SouthShields","#NorthEastEngland","#blueskies"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Port of Tyne in Tynemouth Pier.

Jangan tidur setelah subuh, Karena menutup banyak pintu rejeki bahkan membuat badan menjadi lemas. Kalau misalnya kita terlalu penat, tunggulah pukul 07.00 pagi keatas nah boleh istirahat disaat itu...\n\n2. Biasakan untuk mandi dan bersihkan diri, Mandi sebelum dan setelah subuh akan membantu tubuh menjadi segar dan sehat. Dan juga membuat kita lebih awet muda. \nTidak percaya? Coba buktikan sendiri...\n\n3. Sarapan, biasakan makan diwaktu pagi walaupun hanya sedikit. Karena membuat sel-sel otak, sistem pencernaan serta sistem imun di tubuh kita bekerja dengan baik, Makan roti seiirispun tak apa. Minum susu atau kopi juga mantap. Usahakan makan dan minum walau sedikit...\n\n4. Ini yang paling penting, Baca Al-Quran, Zikir, Sholawat, Mau melakukannya sendiripun tak apa atau mendengarkan murrot atau ceramah dari youtube juga tidak masalah. Asalkan kita niat memberikan \"makan\" hati kita. Hati kita akan jadi kuat dan tidak lemah...\n\n1 jam kita lakukan semua ini, In sya Allah hidup kita lebih bermakna, Dan kita mampu melangkah dan menjalani hari kita lebih baik dan bertenaga...\n\nDari Abu Mas\u2019ud Uqbah bin Amir Al Anshari radhiyallahu \u2018anhu, ia berkata bahwa Rosululloh shallallahu \u2018alaihi wa sallam bersabda,\n\n???? ????? ????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????????\n\n\u201CBarangsiapa yang menunjuki kepada kebaikan maka dia akan mendapatkan pahala seperti pahala orang yang mengerjakannya.\u201D (HR.
