Channelising all the festive banter and food talk in the various lives as well as my Instagram feed into this full on Naivedya thaali was immensely satisfying. Also channelised the #marathimulgi in me for this shudh bramhani offering. I know I haven't followed the rules of uzvi bazu but there's a little bit of my soul in there. @skoranne supervising the proceedings via her book #Pangat was my constant companion too.

I obliged immediately and was in tears after two hours when I finished it.

Two of my favourite novels of all time are \u2018To the Lighthouse\u2019 - sublime, elegiac; and \u2018Orlando\u2019 - hilarious, audacious, wise. But it\u2019s Virginia Woolf\u2019s diaries I return to again and again as to an old friend for comfort and delight, dipping in and out and never needing to read in chronological order. The way she wrestles with her work, her moods, her tricky balance between social obligations and solitary vocation; the cyclical nature of all things. \n\nTo watch a mind watching itself here is magic. \n\nThis ancient book is particularly precious to me because I\u2019m such a sentimental sap. @markustone found it in a secondhand bookstore in Clunes five ago and said, \u2018Hey, how about this? You like her don\u2019t you?\u2019 \nAnd I pounced upon it immediately, having never read her diaries before. It\u2019s old and battered, and because I\u2019ve loved it so well the cover was coming off. And now he has mended it and covered it with contact and it\u2019s rescued! True love, despite the fact he\u2019s never really cared to read much of her work himself ?. \n\nI love how In this excerpt photographed VW is thoroughly sick of herself, and even of that beautiful book Orlando; how she detests her own \u2018volubility\u2019.

This lockdown has gotten the best and the worst out of me.\n\nOn one hand, it has taught me the importance of keeping oneself busy, indulging in new hobbies, and the importance of friendships. At the same time, it has multiple times made me feel caged, suffocated, brought out the worst anxieties in me, and something I'd never ever experienced before - anger\/rage attacks. \n\nI find myself losing control of myself at the smallest of things, feel such a strong bout of anger that I just want to throw things and scream at the top of my voice. Usually happens in interactions with my closest people. And I often end up pushing them away by this behaviour. \n\nI'm often told that I'm overreacting, that this is my strategy to shut them up, or a way to blackmail them to get things done my way. And that angers me even more.\n\nI've always been a short tempered, impatient and impulsive person, but I didn't know that it could come out in ways like these. It also leads to feelings of guilt and shame for lashing out on people that I love the most and making them go through hell. But I don't know how to help it.\n\nI'm trying though. I'm taking baby steps. Like taking deep breaths as soon as I see my temper rising, meditating, and exercising. It isn't easy but I'll get there.\n\nI'm putting this out here solely because I'm sure many of you are facing similar situations, where people around you are unable to understand what you're going through. This is to tell you that it's okay if people don't get you. It doesn't matter. What matters is for you to realise and accept that there is something that you need to do to break the cycle, and change those unhealthy behaviours.\n\nIt's not going to be easy. And it's not going to happen overnight. But it'll happen. The only person who needs to have faith in you is YOU. And all you gotta do is take baby steps, and you'll get there. \n\nWhenever I feel caged, I go to my terrace, put on some Frank Sinatra tunes, and enjoy the sunset. I see numerous birds flying around in the sky like they have no worries. And sometimes, I wish I was one. \n\nWhat do you do when you feel suffocated?

This couldn\u2019t have been fiction, for the rawness of characters, experiences, the wallops of sensibilities, dubious repentance, felt like a documented re-telling of a livid, lived episode. \n\nThis is a letter from a son to his mother, content of which is written with a hope to be read someday, understood someday, felt someday. His family is a survivor of the war in Vietnam, distorted fragments of which is seen in what follows their survival. For a story this short, the topics branched bears quite some weight.\n\nOcean Vuong explores language on both a micro and macro level. A sense of poetry flows down in the writing (not surprising considering Ocean Voung is widely popular for his poems!), streaming across subjects of sexuality, race, gender, masculinity, grief and language. \n\nPlease give this a read. This is simple beauty of words, fear and ache, memory and survival, existence. \n\nCurrent goodreads rating: 4.05, and a delightful 10 for me! ?\n#onearthwerebrieflygorgeous #oceanvuong #asianwriters #vietnamwar #motherandsonbond #lockdowndiaries #americandream #warfiction #warfictionbooks #existentialism #existentialcrisis #queerpride #queerbooks #conscioussexuality #masculinity #goodreads #goodreadschallenge2020","NumberOfLikes":27,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by \u2022 The Lavelle Library \u2022 on August 21, 2020 tagging @ocean_vuong.","NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1598033490,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 20:11:30 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"\u201CIn times of great stress or adversity, it\u2019s always best to keep busy, to plow your anger and your energy into something positive.\u201D\u2013 Lee Iacocca\n\n#fashiondiaries #passiondiaries #lockdowndiaries #fashiondesigner #gowns #gowndesigner #custommade #babydresses #covidgoaway #nastyvirus","NumberOfLikes":12,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Andrea Pasco in Cityland Townhouse Oranbo, Pasig City.","NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1598032304,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 19:51:44 CEST 2020","Location":"Cityland Townhouse Oranbo, Pasig City"},{"CaptionText":"Di?a ??7?\u20E31?\u20E37?\u20E38?\u20E39?\u20E3 de la cuarentena: caged bird ?\n.\n.\n.\n#lockdown #lockdown2020  #cuarentena #stayathome #encerrados #trapped #cage #caged #sunlight #sun \n#selfie  #blackhairgirl #lockdowndiaries  #pretty #love #guapas #urbanphotography  #latina #beautiful #mexicana #bestoftheday #scoutme  #instalike #brunette #instagood #quaranqueen #longhair #picoftheday? #urban #cagedbird","NumberOfLikes":45,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Tiranosaurio Jr. on August 21, 2020.

I took this as an opportunity to work on my strength & experience different forms of fitness.I have a fixed plan when I am training for events,but this time gave me a chance to try new ways to improve my fitness. I used my time for indoor rides, strength training , military fit training, mobility work & started practicing yoga which has helped me become stronger. Before the lockdown, I was facing some knee pain so I worked on strengthening & rehab.\nNow I am back to outdoor running & rides and I continue to follow my routine from lockdown which includes strength & yoga sessions.\n\nThere were days when it was challenging to get myself to workout but then I thought to myself that this is a good time to work on my overall fitness & it's going to help me when things are back to normal :) \" - @fitness.trail \n.\nHave a similar story that you want to share?

Many of us have felt a lot of pressure to make the most of the time, to do the things we have never had time to do. I know very few people who were truly happy with what they achieved during lockdown. Now it\u2019s easing, the guilt & blame for not writing the book, redecorating the house, knitting a combine harvester, is huge. Society puts so much pressure on us to achieve, & to keep raising the bar, it can feel so overwhelming & make us feel at the bottom of the heap.\n\nLockdown was unlike anything any of us had ever experienced, everything was different, unknown, scary & very limiting in so many ways. Personally, just getting through it was achievement enough, managing to have some semblance of normal life was a major achievement. Now we are faced with an easing, but also a constant change of rules & doing things. Many people are feeling a bit stuck, not really able to get going, feel motivated & are struggling to focus.\n\nWe really should be allowed to take into account how much harder it is to do normal everyday tasks. Meeting up with friends... a minefield! Are we supposed to? Are we being irresponsible? Are bubbles still a thing, how do I manage that? Am I going to get told off, fined a ton of money, catch the virus? It wasn\u2019t like this before, now we have a lot of things to navigate.\n\nWe should start by letting ourselves off the hook a little, & celebrate getting any task done, if we do manage to do something productive, congratulate ourselves & make it as big as we can.\n\nIf we can allow it to be the case, that it\u2019s much harder now doing anything out there, maybe we can shorten our to do lists a bit & do a little dance every time we change the bed or send an email.\n\nI\u2019m doing a little dance as soon as I\u2019ve finished writing this. Having set out twice to go to the shops & have to come back because I forgot my face mask, things take longer & are more frustrating. Celebrate your wins, no matter how big or small!\n\nHas anyone else been struggling to stay motivated?","NumberOfLikes":22,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Mental Health Providers in London, United Kingdom.

So couldn\u2019t post anything .

Yesterday evening was very tensed & worrisome ( happens: not every day is the same) so thought of retiring to bed early & have a sound sleep . Today\u2019s breakfast was  my husband\u2019s favourite; Koki (popular sindhi breakfast) & hot sweet tea , followed by sindhi lunch of mili dal, rice, gobhi aloo fry & brinjal fry( again a  popular sindhi lunch) . U ppl had to see my daughter\u2019s face while having lunch ??????..She\u2019s loves  Chinese cuisine??& me a doting mommy couldn\u2019t see her grrrrinng ? . For dinner I prepared Veg manchurian & hakka noodles( everyone must be knowing it\u2019s preparation), not uploading the pics of cutting, chopping & saut�ing because Instagram allows only ten pics at a time with each  post( ??) . Feel free to dm me in case anyone wants to know the recipes. Daughter was super happy having the dinner ?, Husband likes only noodles ( he is not very fond of manchurian; that too dry one) but had to make manchurian because me & daughter love this combo..& since we are not eating outside food , the craving is even much more. The work & pain was all worth when daughter planted a kiss on my cheek after having dinner ??.

After 4 gruelling years of studying her craft, my sister @aana.design graduated from Edinburgh college of art with a BA honours in jewellery and silversmithing. Sadly due to the #covid19 lockdown she never made it to her graduation ceremony or her new designers opportunities in London. After submitting her work to the online graduate show she was shortlisted for the global design graduate showcase awards but her success relies on public votes. She got to this point through her hard work, determination and talent. My bias aside, she is one badass jeweller, pure hearted and deserves to go far. I\u2019m asking you to please support her now by taking less than 60 seconds to vote for her in this competition. Click on the link in my bio, then click on \u201Cvote for Stevie\u201D. This link will take you directly to the voting page. Click on \u201Cvote for this project\u201D and that\u2019s it done. No need to enter your details or anything! Simple and sweet.

With elderly parents & a child under nine months, I felt helpless in not being some kind of human shield so they can remain unharmed. Though seeing all the suffering around, I am achingly aware of my own privilege. There seems to be a strange relationship with time. It feels more visceral than ever before but also blurred, with days merging into each other. Most of all, there is a sense of losing time.\n\nAs a response to what was happening around me & within, I started creating digital collages, one every day for about 15 days almost like traversing the stages of grief \u2013 & unwittingly the sense, mood & state of mind somewhere started to shift. These collages became an articulation of my own process of healing, both practice & an approach. What started with denial, & an awareness of the fragility of reality began to steer towards surrender- a sort of acceptance of the uncertainty. It has been difficult to let go of control but that is something I have just started to sit with & not be so afraid of. \n\nHowever na�ve it might seem right now, eventually, I\u2019d like to reach a point of hope, something that Neil Gaiman writes so beautifully about:\n\u201CThere are so many fragile things\u2026Stories, like people & butterflies & songbirds' eggs & human hearts & dreams, are also fragile things, made up of nothing stronger or more lasting than twenty-six letters & a handful of punctuation marks. Or they are words on the air, composed of sounds & ideas-abstract, invisible, gone once they've been spoken - & what could be more frail than that? But some stories, small, simple ones about setting out on adventures or people doing wonders, tales of miracles & monsters, have outlasted all the people who told them, & some of them have outlasted the lands in which they were created.\u201D \n\u201COur stories will outlive us.\u201D\n\n@vasuvious is a self-trained digital artist.

It is prepared from rice using the dum method of cooking. \n\nTo make the best out of this recipe, chicken needs a proper marination which mainly helps to tenderize it, resulting in juicy, flavourful and soft chicken. It can be marinated the previous night and refrigerated to make the best flavourful Hyderabadi biriyani ?\n\nI must mention that chicken biryani is a lengthy process that needs some experience. But, you will surely master how to make perfect biryani after a couple of trials. Even though I make biryani very often, sometimes I falter. I either overcook the rice or over-fry the onions. (in the images you will see that the fried onions are darker and not golden brown?) \n\nIt happens but there is always another day and another chance to try.

Not something I was wishing for but just something necessary for all. \nThis embroidery piece here is my assignment. As a part of the project we were supposed to connect to any kind of art rooted in our family. My mother tells me a lot of stories about how her grandmother made her frocks and ponchos. Not very often, but I have seen my grandmother making woolen gloves, socks and sometimes she also makes carpet. I do not know how to make clothes but I tried my hands with wool embroidery and made this small piece. I learnt to make those buds from YouTube and other patterns are mere result of going with the flow.\nMade this back in May wala lockdown, didn't have proper needle and all, the struggle was real. ? Also instead of doing it on fabric I decided to upcycle 'plastic ko bora'.\nHad pricked my fingers so many times and let's just not talk about the untangling threads. ? Well overall felt good to see the textures at the end. When I showed it to my grandma she liked it, so it's a win - win ?\n\nHow's it guys, honest opinion la? Should I make more during Lockdown 2.0? ?\n\nP. S.

In 1657, Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj annexed this fort along with Mahuli, Lohgad, Visapur, Songad, Tala and Karnala forts in Konkan. After entering through the door, turn left. After walking a short distance, you come across a water tank and a cave. The path leading up to the side of the cave leads directly to the entrance of the fort. There is a water tank on the right as you enter through the door. On the left you can see the ramparts. Going up from here, there is a temple of Mahadev in front. There is a big moat behind the temple. After traverse it, we reach the place of the flagpole.

To call it a \u201Cwriter\u2019s block\u201D would be reductive; it is existential crisis, as we know it. In that sense, the lockdown has been a blessing, allowing me to express myself in a different way (for what is art if not a form of expression?). It has also served as a steady reminder, that I am more than the words I speak\/write. And so, despite well-meaning and sardonic comments alike on how I\u2019ve been \u201Ccooking a lot these days,\u201D I keep going on, simply because it is another conduit for the imaginings and imaginations within me. Using leftover crispy smashed potatoes from last night\u2019s dinner as the base for a quick papeta par edu-like dish for lunch, kind of gives me the same joy I would derive from restructuring a sentence to make more sense, or express better the things I am trying to say.
