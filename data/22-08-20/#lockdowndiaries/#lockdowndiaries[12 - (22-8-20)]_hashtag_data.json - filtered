Link to the song is in my bio. \n\nWhen the #lockdown had first started in India, was unsure on what to do next.. The #commercial impact apart, there was a likely #creative impact too.. So decided to just work out a way to make a song end-to-end at home itself with whatever resources that were available.. Taking a simple progression & a simple thought ahead \" I'll be there you \" was born.. Little did I expect the feedback that was to follow and now that Songdew came forward to take it up for a digital platforms release, it is one of the most fulfilling moments to have my first effort in production reach this far.. \n\nAcknowledging the importance of the moment, I did get the song re-mastered at @graysparkaudio so that it's fit for release on #streamingplatforms so thanks to @ronakrunwal for giving it the finishing touch. \n\nSorry for the long post..

This, i am doing since two years, but this thing has  become more fun for me during this lockdown, with no tuitions and work, this thing is serving as an amusing game or timepass,you can say. Every evening after having tea, i sit down with my notebooks accompanied with dictionary and make friendship with new words. \nIt is helping me to overcome my boredom, you see. :) \nReally, books are our truest friend, they can help us in so many ways.\nI don't know if this makes sense to anyone, but i am kinda addicted to this thing now.\n.\nI conceived this idea of documenting all the mundane things around me which keep me alive and help me to be contented with my day to day life.\nThese covid days are gloomy, grey and chaotic.

Here are a few things you can stop doing right now to help protect our planet??\n1. Shopping Fast Fashion - Fashion is the world\u2019s second most polluting industry all thanks to fast fashion\u2019s cheap and unscrupulous processes. Buy less and choose better. Follow the #30wears rule. \n\n2. Traditional calendars - Don\u2019t you think calendars are among the most wasteful single-use products? This year I shifted to a plantable calendar bought from @ecoindian  and FYI I\u2019m growing tomatoes, marigold and tulsi this year ?\n\n3. Tumble drying your clothes - \nAn average drying-machine cycle uses just over 4kWh of energy and produces around 1.8kg CO2. If all households with a tumble dryer dried one load of washing outside each week, instead of by machine, they would save over a million tonnes of CO2 in a year. \nIn short, tumble dry sucks so pls dry your clothes in the sun?\n\n4. Animal tested skincare - There is just no excuse for using products that have been tested on animals. And it\u2019s unfortunate that a lot of big brands still do animal testing but the good news is that there are SO MANY new, small and local brands that are cruelty free, organic and a lot of other awesome things. \n\n5. Don\u2019t be a spectator. Take action - Sustainability is a way of life that appreciates all forms of life and provides the pathways for collective prosperity. The time to watch from the sidelines is long gone. You are a key part of this global revolution. Realise your responsibility and act on it. \n\nThat\u2019s it for now! I hope these points get you thinking and that you can start making more informed and responsible lifestyle choices?\n\nStay strong, stay safe ?\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n#sustainablefashion #sustainableliving #consciousliving #naturelover #traveldiaries #stylediaries #lifestyle #goodvibesonly #instadaily #lifestyleblogger #ootdfashion #healthylifestyle #quarantinelife #lockdowndiaries #goodvibesonly? #igfashion","NumberOfLikes":350,"Hashtags":["#30wears","#sustainablefashion","#sustainableliving","#consciousliving","#naturelover","#traveldiaries","#stylediaries","#lifestyle","#goodvibesonly","#instadaily","#lifestyleblogger","#ootdfashion","#healthylifestyle","#quarantinelife","#lockdowndiaries","#goodvibesonly?","#igfashion"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Sanah Mehra in Planet Earth with @sanahsharmaofficial.

Our approach to learning can be summed up as \u201CRead great books, and lots of them.\u201D Between my four school-age kids, we used all these books today. We take a Charlotte Mason approach to learning, where we spread a feast of subjects for the student, letting them sample a little each day on multiple topics. Most of the books here are spread out over a term, some over the year. Each child has many more for the year than what I\u2019ve pictured, and I haven\u2019t included our English curriculum or the maths I use with my younger two students. We use the Catholic Charlotte Mason curriculum, Mater Amabilis, as the source of most of our book choices, with a few modifications for our family.

So got the husband @thebrowneyedguy to watch haircut tutorials on YouTube and then try it out on me. We didn\u2019t even have sharp scissors that work properly so he used his electric razor. I\u2019m so impressed with the result. It\u2019s not level, but it\u2019s pretty good for a first try at hair cutting. We\u2019re calling it the Mowgli cut. Do you like it? I love it! \n\n#lockdowndiaries #lockdownwithbae #trysomethingnew #newlook #sofresh #bradmondonyc #mowgli @bradmondonyc","NumberOfLikes":90,"Hashtags":["#lockdowndiaries","#lockdownwithbae","#trysomethingnew","#newlook","#sofresh","#bradmondonyc","#mowgli"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":20,"Timestamp":1595442241,"LocalDate":"Wed Jul 22 20:24:01 CEST 2020","Location":"NIbm road kondwha"},{"Owner":"robertdraws","CaptionText":"I was thinking this week that for me one of the hard things about the pandemic has also been one that's difficult about depression\u2014 it's very tempting to imagine a kind of narrative arc to it where it's really hard, but then everything gets better, and then that doesn't happen and that makes things harder than they were.\n\nI know I thought that lockdown easing would be nice. And it has been nice! But it's also involved things like visiting shops I've not been to for months and seeing them full of cordons and plastic shields; seeing the difference for the first time is always more difficult than watching things gradually change. Things like being surrounded by families in the park who are trying to pretend that they're having fun. They were looking forward to having fun, their eyes all say. They don't know what to do now it's miserable here as well.\n\nI know a lot of people have found this time hard, much harder than they thought they would. And they don't know how to say it's been hard because it wasn't supposed to be hard, and being unhappy is always harder when you're somewhere that's meant to be nice. At times like this I often think I need to tell myself a new story that can cope with how messy my actual life and feelings are. I'm not sure I've thought of one quite yet. But I think it's important to admit that I'm trying to find one, rather than to pretend the one I had is working especially well.\n\n#depression #lockdowndiaries #pessimism #depressiondrawing #pandemicart #depressionart #depressionposts","NumberOfLikes":22,"Hashtags":["#depression","#lockdowndiaries","#pessimism","#depressiondrawing","#pandemicart","#depressionart","#depressionposts"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Robert Shepherd in Edinburgh, United Kingdom.
