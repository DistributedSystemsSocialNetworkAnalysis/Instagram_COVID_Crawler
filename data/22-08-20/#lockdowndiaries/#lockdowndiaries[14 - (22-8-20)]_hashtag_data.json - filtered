While most recipes that I post, are simple and easy to make, I am making room to post more basic cooking tips and recipes for those who just need to fry an egg and make some Dal to be content and survive this: Welcome to the Self Quarantine Starter Kit ?\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nRecipe in Story Highlights under Dal. ?\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#dal #daal #curry #currylover #currynight #currys #indianfood #indianfoodbloggers #indianfoodie #indianfoodlovers #indianfoodtales #indianfoods #indiancuisine #pulses #lentil #lentilsoup #lentils #lentilstew #lentilcurry #indiancooking #indiancuisines #lockdownrecipes #lockdowncooking #lockdowndiaries #survival #survivalkit #pandemiccooking #selfquarantine? #selfquarantine #mypandemicsurvivalplan","NumberOfLikes":51,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":8,"Timestamp":1595231799,"LocalDate":"Mon Jul 20 09:56:39 CEST 2020","Location":"Keep It Simple,Stupid."},{"CaptionText":"Private teachers nowadays..???\n#lockdown #lockdown2020 #lockdowndiaries #lockdownlife #teacher #teachersofinstagram #teaching #teachingfromhome #onlineclassesmemes #onlineclasses","NumberOfLikes":33,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by karan purohit on July 20, 2020.

Alberobello literally translates to \u2018Beautiful Tree\u2019. The Trulli or the beautiful houses with the conical roofs have an interesting story. History has it that back in the 15th century, every settlement was subjected to a tribute that had to be paid to the kingdom of Naples. The Counts who were the owners of the territory of Alberobello, merrily passed that on to the residents, of course. To work around this, the peasants decided to build their dwellings dry, without using mortar, so that they could be configured as precarious buildings and easily demolished. So technically, they were not a settlement:)\nHaving to use only stones, the peasants found in the round form with the self-supporting domed roof the simplest configuration. The roofs were embellished with decorative pinnacles representing the signature of the architect \u2018Master Trullaro\u2019. I like the idea of a bunch of peasants sitting around with the latest tax decree in their hands, thinking of how to get around it and coming up with the Trulli. Ladies and Gentlemen, you\u2019re looking at one of earliest recorded successful attempts at tax evasion. Full marks for getting around the system, and looking great while you\u2019re at it! Oh and the peasants last laugh is now a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Anxiety is common with the possibility of getting affected, but what\u2019s more for people at home is the frustration that is building up into their minds, slowly. Anger, agitation, frustration, and all other related forms can be seen on a rise. Be it the disappointed fury that appears when you see someone evidently breaking the lockdown rules, or the worried frustration when people don\u2019t adhere to the social distancing rules in the outside world \u2013 anger is everywhere. There\u2019s also angry sadness over the uncertainty of our futures \u2013 and our present. According to Dr Donna Grant, Consultant Psychiatrist at Priory Hospital Chelmsford, the reason we might be feeling more tetchy than normal could be to do with the sense of loss we\u2019re feeling at the moment. She explained, \u201CPeople may be experiencing a loss of routine, a loss of contact with friends, work colleagues and family, as well as a loss of loved ones through bereavement \u2013 all of which can make us feel more irritable and angry.\u201D The only way to tackle this is to invest it into something productive, to turn the chaos into kindness.\n_\nVisit us at www.cowin.live\n_\n\n#cowin #global #covid19 #who #pandemic #lockdown #globalpandemic #coronavirus #HealthForAll #stayhome #staysafe #socialdistancing #safetymeasures #awareness #lockdowndiaries #quatantine #homebound #unitednations #technology #tech #TechnologyForGood #techstartup #techsolution #instatech #appdesign #healthcare #quarintinelife #canada #globaleconomy #indianeconomy","NumberOfLikes":11,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Collective Win on July 19, 2020.

This might be a hard adjustment for us, particularly when we interact with others. Why?\n~\nWe don\u2019t like talking with our mouth covered. Social norms can make this feel like we\u2019re being rude. People might pull their mask down to talk and then pull it back up again rather than experience that discomfort.\n~\nOur faces make a huge range of expressions, and around 70% (different studies will give you a different stat, but it\u2019s pretty high) of communication is non-verbal.

If you always wear a hat when you go out and then leave it behind, you\u2019ll feel its absence.\n~\nWearing a mask may not come easily, so start practicing around your home now.

He is known as one of Hollywood\u2019s strong figures and one of the highest grossing actors. Johnson talked about the challenges he\u2019s faced in maintaining his mental health. He mentioned how \u201CStruggle and pain is real,\u201D and how depressed and devastated he felt during those times. There were days when he was \u201Ccrying constantly\u201D. A series of unfortunate events had led to the occurrence of the depression ever since he was 15. From his parents struggling to ear a living, to his mother\u2019s suicide attempt, to his injuries that made him drop out of college and let go of his dream of scholarship. Johnson faced all these events. However, he managed to pick himself up. He found his inner strength and managed to survive. His experience inspired many to overcome their situations in life and to strive towards an optimistic future. Johnson said this in an interview that he and his mother \u201Cboth healed, but we\u2019ve always got to do our best to pay attention when other people are in pain. We have to help them through it and remind them they are not alone.\u201D\n_\nVisit us at www.cowin.live\n_\n\n#cowin #global #covid19 #who #pandemic #lockdown #globalpandemic #coronavirus #HealthForAll #stayhome #staysafe #socialdistancing #safetymeasures #awareness #lockdowndiaries #quatantine #homebound #unitednations #technology #tech #TechnologyForGood #techstartup #techsolution #instatech #appdesign #healthcare #quarintinelife #canada #globaleconomy #indianeconomy","NumberOfLikes":8,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Collective Win on July 19, 2020 tagging @therock.

No one knows. The title of official ice cream inventor has never been awarded. What we do know is, as far back as 200 B.C., people have enjoyed variations of frozen treats. Alexander the Great loved snow flavoured with honey and nectar, biblical references have been made to King Solomon\u2019s desire of iced drinks, and Nero Claudius Caesar was known to send servants to the mountains for snow to then be flavoured with fruits and juices. However, it is the Chinese who are most often credited with the invention of today\u2019s ice cream. They figured out that packing snow into a bowl of rice and milk made a tasty treat. Then a thousand years later, Marco Polo returned home from a trip to the Far East with a recipe similar to modern day sherbet. The craze quickly spread throughout Europe\u2019s upper class, and royalty during the 1500s.\n.\n.\n\nIndia, on the other hand, boasts of an impressive history of ice cream as well. In the sixteenth century, Mughal rulers were known to send relays of horsemen to collect and transport ice from Hindu Kush to Delhi, in order to make fruit sorbets. Kulfi, referred to as the \u201Ctraditional ice cream of India\u201D, also originated in the sixteenth century, during the Mughal reign.\n\nAt present, India stands as the world\u2019s fastest growing ice cream market. As per reports, the ice cream sales in India have increased by 13 per cent per year over the last 7 years.\n.\nHappy world Ice Cream day ? \n.\n#icecream #chocolateicecream #almondicecream #roastedalmondicecream #lockdown #homemade  #homechef #chocolatealmondicecream #qurantinecooking #lockdowncooking #lockdowndiaries #chocolatesauce #yummy #yummyinthetummy #dessert #desserts #summertime #coolcoolicecream #worldicecreamday #happyworldicecreamday","NumberOfLikes":27,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by All things food in Delhi - NCR with @theterracekitchen.

Thought I might give you a blow by blow of a DIY project that I actually managed to complete - the curtain rods. Its all on stories but if you missed it, here's the low down.\nI really loved the West Elm curtain poles, but at �89(!!) for one, and I needed two, there was no way I could get them. So I bought a very cheap, but mostly similar looking pole from @dunelmuk and a pot of gold furniture paint from @makeitrustoleum. Painted the finnial and the attachment to the wall (not that you can see it!) with about three coats and they look amazing. So happy with them!

Or life throws tantrums at you? I immediately go back to my forever watchlist!\n\n? I'd start with the series that's my all the me favourite and even while I'm writing this Instagram post, Miranda Hobbes is staring at me from laptop screen. I mean how could someone exist and not love this?\n\n?The second one would be quite obvious after this, both the shows ran at the same era and both shows have a plot entirely based on friendship. I can tell now that I am over F.R.I.E.N.D.S., but I kind of  waiting till my next me tal breakdown to take place, and bang! I'd be binge-watching the show for nights!\n\n? I don't love Sex and the City movies as much as the series, but still they're my instant mood lifters! Both movies 1 and 2 are my \n\"fashion extravaganza\" escape forever!\n\n?10 things I hate about you, I entirely watch it from the love and memories of Heath Ledger. Plus, the movie is a very good refreshment!\n\n? I've watched Eat,Prey, Love over and over again, at the lowest point of times. Julia Roberts is the reason and soul searching is the cause for this choice.\n\n? People who've already familiar with what 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' a masterpiece is have never got over it! Nor did I! I occasionally watch it when I get very emotional at times. And somehow it still manages to mesmerize me like it did at the very first time!\n\n? Forrest Gump has the very same reason like the previous one! I never got over it! And I don't think I ever will!\n\n? When I want to believe that, 'Love conquers  us all\", I immediately get back to 'The Holiday', obvious reasons are the ensemble cast and of course a younger Jude Law, and in fact the love stories that I solely want to believe in. ?\n\n? Anne with an E is the youngest watch to be in the list. But I'd stand by my choice, I have never came across such a show that feels exactly I'm going from one page of a book to another, while painting a beautiful picture myself.\n\nWhat show\/movie you never got over with?

I know people are going to look at me whatever I do. Back in Devon where I\u2019m from I\u2019ve had stuff thrown at me down the street. Here, people are so positive. It\u2019s incredible to live in a place where people can be free. And yet it\u2019s hard to believe that it\u2019s so radical - in 2020 - to be yourself. But that\u2019s what it is and that\u2019s why I moved here,\u201D he said. \nMatthew works on new product launches in branding and social media for Irregular Choice, the iconic shoe and fashion brand founded in Brighton. \u201CIt has that unique quality that everyone loves.\u201D\nHe says he has loved fashion since he was a child and was the costume designer for all his school plays. \u201CI used to play with dolls to escape and then I fell in love with clothes.\u201D\nGrowing up, Matthew needed 12 surgeries - the first when he was a baby and the last just two years ago. He says the most difficult was having his jaw broken and realigned which meant he couldn\u2019t eat solid food for three months. He has also had to cope with the psychological impact of the operations.\n\u201CIt\u2019s been crazy, my face keeps changing.\u201D\nMatthew says he has always worn both men\u2019s and women\u2019s clothes. Several years ago, one Halloween whilst studying footwear design at Leicester University, he decided to go out in drag. He then started performing under the pseudonym Dame Deadly, dressing up as Cruella de Vil and other characters.\nMatthew - who describes himself as the sparkly sheep of the family - says his brother, mother and step-dad all work for the NHS. He has been worried about them during the pandemic and has missed them. His flatmate moved home during lockdown, so he spent a lot of time alone at home, working and sewing and experimenting with clothes. Recently, when his mum was finally allowed to visit, she was so pleased to see him looking happy.\n\u201CShe said I looked awake again.\u201D\nMatthew can\u2019t imagine moving back to Devon where he says he was bullied relentlessly as a child.\n\u201CBut they\u2019re all working in Tesco now and I\u2019m branding beautiful shoes in Brighton,\u201D he said.\n#brighton","NumberOfLikes":265,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Brighton Peeps in Hove Seafront with @irregularchoice, @justinedesmondphoto, @damedeadly, and @daisyoclee.
