The music is blaring in our ears, the energy is high, someone is working out next to you, or in the screen or video and it's easy to want to go harder and faster, and quite frankly most of the time that ignite the inner most desire to finish first or at least not last. And that is what pushes us to focus on the count and not the form. \nThe key to every workout we do is to make our body  strong and and get a good physique. But do not Sacrifice on the form as it can punish you in a bad way and injure you severely.\n\nSo please please please,  FORM over SPEED and COUNT.\n\n#lockdowndiaries\n#thursdaymotivation\n#formoverspeed\n#formovercount\n#workouttips\n#workoutmotivation\n#tipfortheday\n#knowledgeispower\n#healtheducation\n#learning\n#coaching\n#fitpreneur\n#lovewhatido\n#fitcoach_sid","NumberOfLikes":12,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597306283,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 13 10:11:23 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Have you signed up for our lockdown challenge ? ??\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#lockdownchallenge #lockdown #covid #stayhome #lockdownlife #quarantine #staysafe #challenge #coronavirus #quarantinelife #lockdownindia #corona #quarantinechallenge #socialdistancing #india #lockdownart #lockdowndiaries #art #instagood #instagram #stayathome #naturalhair #stayhomechallenge #stayhomestaysafe #photography #fitness #curlyhair #lockdownmemes #curlyhairstyles #bhfyp","NumberOfLikes":33,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":14,"Timestamp":1597306185,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 13 10:09:45 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Today's delicacies...

I have thought about this scene several times since. Grafton street is usually bursting with atmosphere, with musicians, singers, artists, tourists, shoppers and the general hustle and bustle of a capital city. All of them gone now. The ladies that sell the flowers ? have also departed. Usually at the top of Grafton street there is a queue of carriage horses waiting to transport tourists around the city, there was only one carriage. Shops have closed, and won\u2019t be reopening.\nI didn\u2019t know whether to post this or not and I had to think about it. I started my insta page as I wanted to post up beat images of simple things in life that get me through and make me happy and also maybe things that I had neglected to appreciate pre corona. I do think that it is important that people remember that ones\u2019 insta page may not be a true representation of the \u2018owner\u2019, it is only a segment of their lives. My aim was to create a page that appreciates the small things and helps me forget about the devastation the corona virus has caused. There are times when I think of how drastically life has changed and life pre corona... One thing I really miss is the soothing embrace of a good auld ? hug (nothing beats that), the craic that was to be had in the pubs and going to a gig and dancing or standing in the audience squeezed in a sea of people. Ah the good old days.......

Yes,that's true to some extent but today I am going to point out some positive sides of this lockdown. Firstly, we can spend time with our families and loved ones. Secondly,although we regret that we can't eat street foods and order from restaurants, we are trying to learn cooking and  cook delicious meals for ourselves and our family. Then in this drudgery of life, our hobbies are always neglected by the busy schedule we always have to follow. Now,we can relive our hobbies and watch our favourite shows. \n\nNow, we also understand the importance of little things in our lives which we had almost taken for granted. People working in the corporate sector now have some relief too. Students don't have to wake up early in the morning to rush for schools and colleges. Road accidents have reduced too. Though there are some blood boiling rape cases,still girls are a little safe from eve teasing. Let us all count the blessings instead of grumbling constantly. \n\nLike ?? if you agree.

My idea of photography is to capture the specific moment to go back to them and relive it. Of course, as I share these images as my artwork, there is no way for the viewers to realize the essence of the moment that was for me. Therefore, I find myself often coupling my photographs with poetry or meaningful quotes. I feel this adds another layer to the images and give an opportunity to the viewer to be transported to their own moments of enrapture. My art demands not merely the skill of photography, but also the awareness of myself and the moments that would be worthy to be captured.\n\nSince the COVID-19 lockdown, stuck in my house, I have failed to come up with moments that hold my attention and emotions. The landscape has always brought out the best in me. I have felt alive in the magnanimity of nature at once. The awareness of my insignificance has inculcated humility in me. Being stuck at home now is not the best feeling. My avenue of expression has been hampered significantly. Even though I did not think of myself as an artist clicking these pictures, these have been the medium of my expression all this while. Currently, it is definitely a struggle to go through the rut of my regular office work and house chores, without having an out-let through such pictures.\n\n@anujkuriachan  is a 28-year-old IT professional who wants to capture nature\u2019s magnanimity through his photography. He is also an aspiring poet. He has his roots in Kerala but was born and raised in Delhi and has lived in Bangalore, Bhilai, and Kolkata. He shares his images of the clouds from pre-lockdown days. During the lockdown, captured from his terrace, the images translates into his wish for an escape.\nIf you or your artist-friends have a story to share, connect with us.\n.\n.\n.\n#ArtistsLockedIn\n#ArtistsoftheWorld #artistsupportartists #ArtistsofDelhi\n#artistsinquarantine #artistsinpandemic #artistsinlockdown #ArtistsDiary #artistsfromunderground #ArtistsinFocus #Lockdowndiaries #photography  #photosofinstagram #himalayas #cloudsofinstagram #cloudscape","NumberOfLikes":24,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1597231863,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 12 13:31:03 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#Repost\nArt by  @slice_of_ar\n@download.ins\n---\nBappa aarhe hai\nToh khushiyan lekar hi ayenge?\n\nTheme: Ganesha\n\nWanna get featured?\nDo follow us and tag @_self.lush___ \nComment below yours.\n\n?DO NOT COPY WITHOUT PERMISSION ?\n\n?If you recreate my artwork give credits and do mention me?\n\n#mandala #mandalaart #ganeshamandalas #blackandwhiteart #mandalasharing #mandaloftheday #godmandala #multa_artista #madrasartchannel #simiartist #hobbiesbyheart #selflush #snehart20 #lockdowndiaries #mandalauniverse #letsgrowtogether #freeartfeaturingpage #zenartfeatures #crazyforsharingmandalas #soulfulartist #artbetweenthelines #arttoonnn #thecreativeladder #mandalatutoriallovesmywork\n@free.artfeaturingpage @multa_artista @madrasartchannel @hobbiesbyheart @_self.lush___ @artmypassion20 @lockd0wn.diaries @mandala.universe @zenart.features @artinfluencer_rahul @artattract_india @crazyforsharingmandalas @soulful.artists @lets.grow.together._ @raveenasaraf @art_between_the_lines @arttoonnn @the_creative_ladder @mandalatutorial","NumberOfLikes":23,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by HEY FOLKS! on August 12, 2020 tagging @slice_of_ar.","NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1597231012,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 12 13:16:52 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Amidst everything going on these days, taking your mind off things (for some self-care) and doing the things you love is always a welcome distraction.

These days, seeing the store-bought vegetables that are either rotten or stale, I wonder whether I should quit the job and start farming instead. To get fresh and non-toxic vegetables, one needs to put in their own efforts. Along with it, watching @manju.warrier's movie 'how old are you?', made a strong will in me to start growing veggies even if it's small level. Three months hence, to see one of my cute tomatoes turn red, there's immense happiness.

When I was around three or four years old, I was awestruck by this mud curving of a small blue-skinned baby, smeared with Makhan all over the body. I didn\u2019t know who he was, so I asked my grandparents. My grandmother narrated the story to me and I felt an attachment with the blue baby then and there. It grew stronger over the years and I always felt that I have an invisible friend in the form of Krishna to guide me.\n.\nJanmashtami for me, and for many others, is a celebration with friends and family and there\u2019s no Janmashtami without a sumptuous lunch spread, after all its his birthday. This year due to obvious reasons I couldn\u2019t invite anyone to celebrate Krishna\u2019s birthday with me.
