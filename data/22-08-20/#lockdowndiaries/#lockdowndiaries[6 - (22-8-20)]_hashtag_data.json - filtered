I was like anything but corona.\n\nMy dad took her  for CT scan and after seeing the report it was one more step towards the grave. We all were shocked hearing about her reports.\n\nAnd then, we took the decision to shift her to a hospital . She was  in ICU for almost 5 days and when she was tested for corona , yet the results were the same. The day she was admitted, she was kept in covid ward under observation. And she started to feel better and there was recovery and that moment I realised that God does exist. Meanwhile, rest of the family was quarantined  as we were also asked to get our test done.\n[CONTINUED IN CAPTION]\n..\n#coronavirus #corona #coronavirusmemes #coronapatients #coronapatient #covid19 #covid_19 #covid #cov?d19 #covi?d19 #pandemic2020 #pandemic #pandemiclife #pandemicorona #qurantinemood #lockdown #lockdowndiaries #coronavï¿½rus #coronagoaway #coronago #2020 #2020isworst #year2020 #coronatime #coronavirï¿½s #coronaindia #covid2020 #qurantinecentre #hospitals","NumberOfLikes":142,"Hashtags":["#audiencewrites","#coronavirus","#corona","#coronavirusmemes","#coronapatients","#coronapatient","#covid19","#covid_19","#covid","#cov?d19","#covi?d19","#pandemic2020","#pandemic","#pandemiclife","#pandemicorona","#qurantinemood","#lockdown","#lockdowndiaries","#coronavï¿½rus","#coronagoaway","#coronago","#2020","#2020isworst","#year2020","#coronatime","#coronavirï¿½s","#coronaindia","#covid2020","#qurantinecentre","#hospitals"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ???????|????????|????????????? on August 07, 2020.

That's the  thing that attracted a non-saree person like me to buy one for myself.\n.\n.\n@sadhguru @smritiiraniofficial @aashkagoradia\n@mia_makingindiaawesome\n.\n.\n#makingindiaawesome? #makingindiaawesome #kanjivaram #kanjivaramsilksaree #kanchipuramsilksaree #kanchipuram #supportlocalbrand #indianculture #sareesofinstagram #handloomsarees #handloomsaree #weavesofindia #iamanawesomeinfluencer #girlbosslifestyle #indianfashionbloggers #indianfashioninfluencer #indianluxuryblogger #desilook #mumbaiinfluencer #traveltheworld? #travelindia?? #lockdowndiaries #greensaree #yellowsaree #cottonsilk #ishafoundation #sadguru #indianlook #photoofthefay","NumberOfLikes":314,"Hashtags":["#savetheweave","#makingindiaawesome?","#makingindiaawesome","#kanjivaram","#kanjivaramsilksaree","#kanchipuramsilksaree","#kanchipuram","#supportlocalbrand","#indianculture","#sareesofinstagram","#handloomsarees","#handloomsaree","#weavesofindia","#iamanawesomeinfluencer","#girlbosslifestyle","#indianfashionbloggers","#indianfashioninfluencer","#indianluxuryblogger","#desilook","#mumbaiinfluencer","#traveltheworld?","#travelindia??","#lockdowndiaries","#greensaree","#yellowsaree","#cottonsilk","#ishafoundation","#sadguru","#indianlook","#photoofthefay"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":30,"Timestamp":1596813508,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 07 17:18:28 CEST 2020","Location":"India"},{"Owner":"mahimavarmabestmehendiarts","CaptionText":"#lockdownbride #lockdownindia #lockdownmakeup #lockdowndiaries #lockdownbrides #lockdownbride2020 #lockdown2020 #lockdownlife #lockdownmehendi #lockdownmehndi #lockdownhenna #lockdownart #lockdownshaadi #lockdownshaadi2020 #lockdownshaadi?? #lockdownmakeover #lockdownmakeuplook #bestmehendiartsbyvijayavarma #mehendibyvijayavarma #mehendibymahimavarma #bestmehendiartsbyvijayavarma","NumberOfLikes":9,"Hashtags":["#lockdownbride","#lockdownindia","#lockdownmakeup","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdownbrides","#lockdownbride2020","#lockdown2020","#lockdownlife","#lockdownmehendi","#lockdownmehndi","#lockdownhenna","#lockdownart","#lockdownshaadi","#lockdownshaadi2020","#lockdownshaadi??","#lockdownmakeover","#lockdownmakeuplook","#bestmehendiartsbyvijayavarma","#mehendibyvijayavarma","#mehendibymahimavarma","#bestmehendiartsbyvijayavarma"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Best Mehendi Mahima Varma in Wagholi, Pune with @poorvagokhale, and @pooju1810.

On one side we have the demographic dividend of 65% youth population eager to take up challenges and work. This phase will not last forever, soon we will become the country full of old and frail mouths to feed. On the other side, the wave of nationalism and pressure of reviving Indic civilization demands a movement that demands years of struggle, sacrifice and correct attitude. It's a junction where we have to choose or balance between these two paths. Denial is not a solution, Anger and hostility is not a solution. At the end of this churning we will emerge stronger, united and more capable of leading the world. But, are we ready? Are we seeing the big picture? It's the game of thrones but in civilizational concept.

Supernatural events keep happening until two priests join forces to defeat evil forces.\n\nThis series deserved way more recognition than it did. It is one of the best tv shows in the horror genre I have ever watched. There were a lot of typical scare tactics, but was nicely riddled with fresh original scenes which was a pleasant surprise. A must watch for all the Exorcism Fans.

It is the belief that each of us is more likely to experience good outcomes and less likely to experience bad outcomes.\nThe key to optimism bias is that we disregard the reality of an overall situation, because we think we are excluded from the potential negative effects.\nIt's just a psychological trap, nothing else.\n:\nRemember a quote from Joseph Stalin, \nA million deaths is a statistic, But one death is a tragedy.\n:\nIt's like if we read the news that 10,000 people died, it doesn't affect us that way, as a single death of someone we know, does. Because when it's a single death, we get to attach the name, story and narrative of that person and feel emotional about it, but a million deaths is indifferent to our psyche. This is another psychological trap.\n:\nSo, the bottom-line is, that no matter how social norms are being relaxed, stay alert, cautious and extra vigilant, as if it's still an EMERGENCY,\nbecause it still is...!!! \nStay safe and go outside only if it is must. \nFollow all the precautions without fail.\nTake extreme Care.\nGood Day! \nWhatsApp forward from one of my friends! \n.\n#staysafeeveryone #stayhealthy #staystrong #wearthedamnmask #gocoronago #coronabedamned #weareinthistogether #wewillgetthroughthis #maskindia #wearamask? #lockdowndiaries #lockdown2020 #bevigilant #besafe #besafeeveryone #socialdistancing #socialdistancing2020 #besociallyresponsible #besociallysmart #besociallydriven #besociallyaware","NumberOfLikes":40,"Hashtags":["#staysafeeveryone","#stayhealthy","#staystrong","#wearthedamnmask","#gocoronago","#coronabedamned","#weareinthistogether","#wewillgetthroughthis","#maskindia","#wearamask?","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdown2020","#bevigilant","#besafe","#besafeeveryone","#socialdistancing","#socialdistancing2020","#besociallyresponsible","#besociallysmart","#besociallydriven","#besociallyaware"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ?ï¿½?\u2022???

I\u2019m troubled by the state of our society, by the pandemic and the lockdowns, thousands of jobs in my city gone, the loss of life in Lebanon, the news that a lovely woman I know has cancer, and a beautiful family that I follow on here have lost their home. There\u2019s so much heaviness, and we are all physically isolated from one another. We weren\u2019t meant to live this way. \n.\nWhen I\u2019m struggling with life I try to take a few moments to sit out on our back steps by myself with a coffee. It\u2019s so good to get some fresh air, and getting out of my house gives me a new perspective, literally and figuratively.  A little time for self-care and our family rosary really help too. \n.\nThe longer this lockdown goes on, the more I see the importance of a strong daily rhythm. When life is confusing and uncertain, it is good to get up and do our daily work, to keep our hands busy. Unable to move freely, I am drawing inspiration from the monastic life, from those cloistered religious who choose to remain in one place, and must live an ordered day within their walls with contentment and love. \n.\nFor the first time in my life I am consistently getting up early. I have surprised myself by enjoying it, and I\u2019m craving even earlier starts. For a confirmed night owl, this could only have been a grace given to me by God. \n.\nI managed to make another contribution towards my #everybitcountschallenge again and made these Vinegared Red Onions from the Ball Preserving Blue Book. I have eight jars to add to my pantry. I have no idea what these will taste like, but isn\u2019t the colour pretty? I didn\u2019t actually grow the onions myself, but if I had, this is where I\u2019d have grown them. ?","NumberOfLikes":169,"Hashtags":["#everybitcountschallenge"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":24,"Timestamp":1596712770,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 06 13:19:30 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"jellyspill","CaptionText":"Treated myself to some comfy slips!
