(FB PAGE : Binal's collection of Short Stories and Quotes)\n\nOnce upon a time, there lived a tailor and her son. One day, due to school holiday, the son visited his mother tailor's work-place. \nBeing too young, his mother made him sit on a stool nearby, at a distance from where they could both see each other. Son saw that his mother would use scissors to cut the clothes, and then would keep aside the scissors besides her feet. Then she would sew clothes with the needle and thread, and after sewing would keep the needles on the scarf worn on the head. \nAfter looking on this sequel for half a dozen times, the son went over to his mother, and said \"May i ask you a question mother?\" Mother replied 'Yes son, what do you want to ask?'\nSon - \"Mother, i am seeing you since a long time. When you cut the clothes, after that you tuck the scissors below your feet; and after you sew the clothes, you keep the needles on your head. Why so?\" \nThe answer which his mother gave,  seemed like she gave an entire life's lesson to her son in two lines. \nMother answered lovingly, \"Son, the scissors work is to cut, and needles work is to sew; And a cutters' place is always down(below), but a sewers place is always at the top. This is the reason that i keep the needles on my scarf and scissors below the feet.\" \n\nMoral:\nIf in Life one wants to reach to the Top, Then one should be Like a Needle and SEW, and not be a Scissor (cutter).\n\nDo like, share and comment this story.\nVisit this section, for more such stories and Quotes at \nFacebook.com\/storiesandquotes1\nAnd\nHappy Reading ?\n\nFollow me @artbyforam for more of such arts?\n.\nDM for Order!\n\n#pencilsketch #realisticdrawing #sketch #sketchartist #pencildrawing #art #artist #artwork #artistsoninstagram #artistsofinstagram #artoftheday #artofinstagram #sketchbook #sketching #sketches #sketchbookdrawing #sketchoftheday #sketchdaily #sketchaday #sketchart #sketchers #pencil #pencilart #pencils #potrait #lockdowndiaries #darshanraval #bluefamily #Darshaners #singlepencilsketch","NumberOfLikes":31,"Hashtags":["#pencilsketch","#realisticdrawing","#sketch","#sketchartist","#pencildrawing","#art","#artist","#artwork","#artistsoninstagram","#artistsofinstagram","#artoftheday","#artofinstagram","#sketchbook","#sketching","#sketches","#sketchbookdrawing","#sketchoftheday","#sketchdaily","#sketchaday","#sketchart","#sketchers","#pencil","#pencilart","#pencils","#potrait","#lockdowndiaries","#darshanraval","#bluefamily","#Darshaners","#singlepencilsketch"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1596119988,"LocalDate":"Thu Jul 30 16:39:48 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"nilufar__16","CaptionText":"#thursday  #thursdaymotivation #lockdowndiaries #lockdownsessions","NumberOfLikes":19,"Hashtags":["#thursday","#thursdaymotivation","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdownsessions"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Nilufar Matin in Gauhati.
