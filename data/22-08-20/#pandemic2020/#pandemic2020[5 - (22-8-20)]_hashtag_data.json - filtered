There was a time when travelling was considered to be a leisure activity which was much needed to escape the monotony of life. Travelling no more is a carefree activity, I remember there was a time when I used to sleep under the trees on bare grass; when I used to travel in congested subways, waiting in the long queues, eating from the road site stalls, hugging and shaking hands with the fellows. Now doing all this requires conscious effort. Accept it or not we all at some point will be & already are being affected by it. Masks & sanitizers are the new essentials for travelling which one may not think of forgetting while leaving home. Planning one\u2019s trip, keeping in mind social distancing, won\u2019t be as easy as it seems. Every cloud has a silver lining, so I am waiting for a time to come when holding the door knob of malls and shopping centers without worrying for the sanitizer will be the new cool.
