When thinking about this, two words came to mind...Time and Adjustment. \n\nI started thinking how much pressure we can put on ourselves to be perfect in every role we play, whether that be mum, dad, child, employee, and then feel guilty for not feeling quite up to what we think is \"standard\".\n\nTime - We sometimes don't give ourselves the time to learn, to make mistakes, for bonds to form and for our strength to rebuild. With the passing of these months I have learnt so much, about my baby, about me, about motherhood and that everything changes all of the time! This has influenced my mindset and my confidence in my abilities as a Mum. \n\nOver this time I have also Adjusted to the role of Mum; new routines, household chores, functioning on less sleep, learning new skills and knowledge, whether that be play, baby sleep or weaning, and being able to make time for friends and family. Don't get me wrong, i don't succeed at all of this all of the time, but I think it is getting alot better.\n\nLooking back I may not have given myself a fair chance at the beginning and I see that now. We all need to give ourselves the chance to grow in whatever roles we have and know it can be peaks and troths all the way (especially with sleep 🙈!). \n\nThis taught me to remember to be patient with myself, stay more in the present moment and I know it sounds cliched, but take each day as it comes and do what I can, and again know that's enough. So essentially the same message as previously, that what you're doing is enough and to give ourselves a chance.\n\nxx\n\n#mumblog #instamum #lockdown #pregnany #firsttimemum #lockdownmummy #momsofinstagram #change","NumberOfLikes":2,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @lockdownmummywrites on August 22, 2020.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598131301,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 23:21:41 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Proper moody ass 😜🖕\n\n#moody #trouble #hair #makeup #bored #lockdown #life #love","NumberOfLikes":16,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @kt1234321 on August 22, 2020.

Previously a debtors and cashbook clerk for a magazine publisher, she is a perfect fit for our admin team. Gen reckons her lovely co-workers and the fact that the work is so varied - there\u2019s always something new happening - makes her job enjoyable. She does not have a favorite product, but she loves our entire range of blue glazes. Gen spends her free time with her 10 year old daughter, nieces and nephew. When time allows, she enjoys reading too! #cherise #skinnyjeans #stellarstaff #lockdown #lockdown2020 #handmade #ceramics #keramik #ceramicas #ceramique #ceramicart #ceramicsofinstagram #ceramicartist #ceramicartists #ceramicartistsofinstagram #claylife #studiolife #capetown #madeincapetown #madeinsa #madeinsouthafrica #madeinafrica #supportsmallbusiness #supportlocal #supportlocalbusiness #supportlocalartists","NumberOfLikes":30,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Bespoke Handmade Ceramics in Cape Town, Western Cape.

Three days before my 50th birthday and I definitely feel older and wiser five months in!  We\u2019ve had the joy of seeing first hand the \u2018learning\u2019 characters of our three stars - their resilience and determination. We\u2019ve watched and supported their anxieties and uncertainties and fielded our own. We\u2019ve home-schooled, counselled and worked from home and I\u2019ve learnt more about our wider family, our Altfield family too. Colleagues who have stepped up to the plate to go above and beyond to make sure samples go out, orders and quotes are put together, clients are supported, suppliers are updated and morale is as high as it can be.  Colleagues who have accepted furlough and taken it in their stride, keeping in touch with each other and making sure everyone is ok. We are facing some sad farewells and are going to miss our teammates hugely. With all the massive positives, the true spirit of Altfield coming to the fore, we will not let anything spoil the view.  This incredible rainbow in the somewhat threatening sky this afternoon just summed up how I feel ..: just as the children have shown us how to keep ones head down and carry on, we will too.  After all, knowing in your heart that you have done your best - and done your best by others as well - is all that really matters at the end of the day. \n\nHere\u2019s to the rest of the year ahead of us!\n#lockdown #fivemonths #coronavirus #work #familylife #workinglife #workinghard #reflecting #rainbows #friends #colleagues  #aboveandbeyond #grateful #thanks #loyalty #honourable #honesty #truegrit #determinatiion #love #dotherightthing #somanythankyous #blessedandgrateful","NumberOfLikes":20,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Emma Lack on August 22, 2020.

OH INNOCENT PAST ME. \n\nSidenote : I want to give a big warm shout-out to all the Toddler Parents who have made it this far without murdering their offspring and\/or each other 🙌🏻\n\nAnyway. This beautiful book, Fika by @annabrones and @johannakindvall had been on my wishlist for ages, and it arrived about a week into lockdown. I had chosen it because of my obsession with cinnamon rolls and my inability to get them right, and the recipe in this book is perfect. And delicious. And I baked it a lot.\n\nBut unexpectedly,  the best thing I discovered about this book is that it is written specifically with the goal of preparing the recipes as simply as possible, without a stand mixer or much in the way of fancy tools. A number of the recipes essentially entail stirring things together, making it an excellent source of recipes to cook with toddlers who like to help in the kitchen. My daughter absolutely loves cooking (in fact one of her earliest words was \"whisk\" 😆) and this gave us a few projects during those interminable days during lockdown where she needed to be entertained quietly and indoors. \n\nThe first recipe we tried from this book was the Fyriskaka, an apple cake spiced with cinnamon and cardamom. I baked that again today, because I had the house to myself while Husband and Toddler went to the park. It is lovely and I recommend it, whether you have a toddler to entertain or not. \n\n(However I think there is a global conspiracy involving food stylists and  cakes that involve concentric circles of Apple slices - if you can get your Apple slices to stay in concentric circles before during and after baking, you are practising witchcraft of some kind 🧙🏻\u200D♀️)\n\n#baking #homebaking  #lockdown #coronabaking  #leconfinement #cake #applecake #fyriskaka #fika #swedish #cuisinesuedoise #toddler #toddlerapproved #cinnamon #cardamom #witchcraft #irishcooking #cuisineirlandaise #urrugne #faitmaison #patisserie #gateau #pomme #momlife","NumberOfLikes":12,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1598126159,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 21:55:59 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"My hair routine\n\n#drorganic #hairroutine #badhairday #routine #arganoil #hairserum #lockdown","NumberOfLikes":1,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598126019,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 21:53:39 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Crazy to get film back that I\u2019ve had on the go since before the start of lockdown.
