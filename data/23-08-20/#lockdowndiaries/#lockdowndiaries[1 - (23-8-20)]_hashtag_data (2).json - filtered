This year due to Pandemic the Ganesh Chaturthi celebration remains a bit low in profile. \nAs a kid I always use to celebrate this festival with so much enthusiasm. \n.\n.\nThis year's festival is special to me because for the very first time I made Bappa's favourite Ukadiche Modak. They weren't as perfect as it's done by using a mould but I enjoyed while making. I made these with shradha in my mind for Bappa. I don't think the shape and size matters infront of the shraddha which makes prasad heaven. \n.\n.\nWe know that Ganpati Bappa is like a friend so he will accept my modaks...\n(Oh my friend Ganesha tu rehena sath humesha)\n.\n.\nI really want to visit Maharashtra at time of Ganesh Utsav to see the happiness that joy in people.\n.\n.\nIn Odisha we celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi a bit different. Like we offer God Boondi Laddoo and  Chudaghasa ( means Chivda powdered with sugar and bit of cardamom) prasad mixed with boondi , sev and fruits. It's different from Modak.\nBut this time I offered Bappa his favourite Modak which made me happy from inside.\n.\n.\nHappy Ganesh Chaturthi to everyone üôè\n.\n.\nFollow @crazy_cravingzz  for more such amazing recipes..\n.\n.\n#lockdowndiaries #modak #ukadichemodak #ganpati #bappa #special #shreeganesh #ganeshutsav #indianfoods #maharastrianfood #mumbai #chefsofinstagram #bloggers #eeeeeats #fasting #indianbloggercommunity #foodphotographer #foodstylists #instagram #foodpost  #homecooking #foodlover #followforfollowbacks #f52gramsfoodpics #foodies #foodlovers  #maharashtra_ig_","NumberOfLikes":91,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":43,"Timestamp":1598162604,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 08:03:24 CEST 2020","Location":"Berhampur, Orissa"},{"CaptionText":"Well. ‚ù§Ô∏è\n.\n.\n#home #lockdowndiaries #instagood #instahome #happiness #love #kidsofinstgram #intsakids #ootd #stylegram #instastyle #fashiongram #outfitoftheday","NumberOfLikes":3,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Alex Navarra on August 22, 2020.

Salads, tomatoes, radish greens, guavas, herbs, mirchis, even a couple of tiny but determined baingan plants valiantly pushing through.... I'm honestly struck by how easy it's been, and how very very rewarding!

It feels so long ago that I took this snap of our bear exploring our garden at dusk, still too hot to wear anything but a nappy. üåû\nI love autumn - it's so beautiful, the season of hygge - I love the crunchy leaves and cool air and evenings getting cosy with the wood burner. But this year is so strange - full of unfinished business. We've not been able to plan so much with our summer or book to take Eden on a city break for the first time. Usually I'd be cruising the Halloween section at TKMaxx already (for full time house decor obviously üéÉ), but instead we're still avoiding town. It's not to complain - everything can wait and we've been perfectly happy slowing down that pace and making our own fun (even if the social restrictions were hard on everybody). But it's just odd to think about what's happened and what may continue to happen, and this strange \"new normal\" we're raising our children in. üçÅ\nIn fact, this year seems to have flown by SO fast - is that just the strangeness of 2020 or is it simply due to having a 15 month old?! üçÇ","NumberOfLikes":45,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Little Pack of Vegans on August 21, 2020.

We\u2019ve come back from Oxford at the time and decided to have dinner before heading back home.\n\nWent down Kings Cross and saw the canal side (Coal Drops Yard way) packed with people without social distancing and face coverings. It seemed just like an ordinary Friday, as if the pandemic was already long forgotten. \n\nSuddenly felt a bit panicky and almost didn\u2019t want to go through with dinner. I just wanted to go home. But the hunger games were tight, and the though of having to cook after a long journey had more appeal than baloney. So we ended up in one of my favourites of the Caprice Holdings franchises, @granarysquarebrasserie. At least, I thought, the food will be good.\n\nThe tables were fairly distanced and they had amazing hand sanitiser spray on each one. Service worked seamlessly although I wish staff would wear face shields. The place was busy but it wasn\u2019t so overwhelming.\n\nFor an hour and a half, the experience was a welcome respite - cocooned in our corner booth, we were safe from what was outside.\n\nIf anything, one of my takeaways from the pandemic is that it\u2019s changed my perception of socialising. As an extrovert, it shocked me how much I just wanted to stay local, or remote. I know we\u2019ve already been out to eat at local places, but it still felt surreal to be out in London again. I get weird anxious feelings about being in \u201Cbusy\u201D places (and that\u2019s usually the \u201Cquiet\u201D standard in normal times).\n\nI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll go away sooner than later. But does anyone else feel like this, too? Or do you guys feel it really is time to pick up and carry on?\n\n#cocktailhour #happyfriday #gandt #granarysquare #londoners #kingscross #lockdowndiaries #everysquareastory","NumberOfLikes":59,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":9,"Timestamp":1597991404,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 08:30:04 CEST 2020","Location":"Granary Square Brasserie"},{"CaptionText":"This made my dayü•∞\nSketch review by happy client\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#feedback #happycustomer #happycustomers #happycustomersmakemehappy #happyclients #happyclient #review #reviews #customersatisfaction #customerreviews #cutomersatisfactionguaranteed #crafts #crafting #lockdown2020 #lockdown #lockdownactivities #qurantinelife #lockdowndiaries #selfquarantine #rakhigifts #rakhi2020 #rakshabandhan #instagood #instadaily #instagram #dailyart #explosionbox #scrapbooking #scrapbook  #shru_art_craft_gallery","NumberOfLikes":336,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":44,"Timestamp":1597990529,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 08:15:29 CEST 2020","Location":"Jalgaon Smart City"},{"CaptionText":"Our creme cleansing shampoo from our papaya range foams less and is creamier and thicker in consistency\n_______________________________\n#repost @chantey_speelman\n#curlchemistry #curlchemistryprices #lockdown #lockdownstash #lockdowndiaries #lockdownsales #lockdowndeliveries #cutlchemistryonline #shopcurlchemistry #howtobuycurlchemistry #onlineshopping #naturalhair101 #shampoo #sulphatefreeshampoo #hairproducts #naturalhairproducts #southafricannaturals #southafricanhairproducts #proudlysouthafrican #localbusiness #localislekker","NumberOfLikes":234,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Curl Chemistry on August 20, 2020 tagging @chantey_speelman, and @curlchemistry.

Many of us have felt a lot of pressure to make the most of the time, to do the things we have never had time to do. I know very few people who were truly happy with what they achieved during lockdown. Now it\u2019s easing, the guilt & blame for not writing the book, redecorating the house, knitting a combine harvester, is huge. Society puts so much pressure on us to achieve, & to keep raising the bar, it can feel so overwhelming & make us feel at the bottom of the heap.\n\nLockdown was unlike anything any of us had ever experienced, everything was different, unknown, scary & very limiting in so many ways. Personally, just getting through it was achievement enough, managing to have some semblance of normal life was a major achievement. Now we are faced with an easing, but also a constant change of rules & doing things. Many people are feeling a bit stuck, not really able to get going, feel motivated & are struggling to focus.\n\nWe really should be allowed to take into account how much harder it is to do normal everyday tasks. Meeting up with friends... a minefield! Are we supposed to? Are we being irresponsible? Are bubbles still a thing, how do I manage that? Am I going to get told off, fined a ton of money, catch the virus? It wasn\u2019t like this before, now we have a lot of things to navigate.\n\nWe should start by letting ourselves off the hook a little, & celebrate getting any task done, if we do manage to do something productive, congratulate ourselves & make it as big as we can.\n\nIf we can allow it to be the case, that it\u2019s much harder now doing anything out there, maybe we can shorten our to do lists a bit & do a little dance every time we change the bed or send an email.\n\nI\u2019m doing a little dance as soon as I\u2019ve finished writing this. Having set out twice to go to the shops & have to come back because I forgot my face mask, things take longer & are more frustrating. Celebrate your wins, no matter how big or small!\n\nHas anyone else been struggling to stay motivated?","NumberOfLikes":22,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Mental Health Providers in London, United Kingdom.

Many have started picking up their cameras to document some of these small, seemingly insignificant and significant moments of everyday life under lockdown.\n\nThe exhibition will be open from 11am-7pm 7 days a week.

That\u2019s when the city sighs, whispers, and sometimes, lets you in on its secrets. You get to see the die hard jogger, the dawn shift construction workers already at the only cafe that\u2019s open, the lone bus driver who nods at you, sometimes a bakery with warm rolls...and if you are really lucky...an early morning meeting of the dog walkers club, with the dogs, of course:) That morning in Edinburgh, I walked the Royal Mile at dawn. My teeth chattering in the cold, the gloves feeling like cellophane and my Jack Wolfskin the only reason I am alive to write this. I saw a sign heading off to a close or a Kloos, as the Scots say, to the right of the Royal Mile. I wanted to walk straight on to the castle, but I\u2019m so glad I took the detour. That was the view down the long dark corridor. The rewards truly are off the beaten path. But it was the sign that led to it, that I simply couldn\u2019t resist. The Scots sure know how to reel you in. #edinburgh #edinburghscotland #edinburghcollagecollective #theroyalmile #royalmile #dawn #dawnpatrol #coldmorning #coldmornings #scotland #scottish #scots #bagpipes #igscotland #igersscotland #thegoodlife #discover #lockdowndiaries #nostalgia #photooftheday #reminiscing #memories #workandplay #iwasthere #nowiamhere","NumberOfLikes":28,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1597939471,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 20 18:04:31 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"What did you wanted to be?\nI wanted to be a Veterinarianüòä\n.\n.\n#whatdoyouwant #ambition #aspiration #doctor #police #teacher #pilot #vet #animals #love #comicstrip #comics #webcomic #autodesksketchbook #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":34,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1597939284,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 20 18:01:24 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"üíúüíúMessed up with my oil pastels cos its been a while since im in touch with my fav colours(maybe 1 year at the least)üíúüíú.\n.\n.\n.\n.#solsjournal #oilpastels  #sunset #paintings #myjournal #lockdowndiaries #boredboredbored #lovecolors #mizopainting","NumberOfLikes":4,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by sommi hmar on August 20, 2020.

It is prepared from rice using the dum method of cooking. \n\nTo make the best out of this recipe, chicken needs a proper marination which mainly helps to tenderize it, resulting in juicy, flavourful and soft chicken. It can be marinated the previous night and refrigerated to make the best flavourful Hyderabadi biriyani ü§§\n\nI must mention that chicken biryani is a lengthy process that needs some experience. But, you will surely master how to make perfect biryani after a couple of trials. Even though I make biryani very often, sometimes I falter. I either overcook the rice or over-fry the onions.

He chooses to be a sheepdog and signs up to become a Navy SEAL. He meets and marries Taya (#SiennaMiller), and after the 9\/11 attacks, he's sent to Iraq. His mission is to protect his fellow SEALs, but his skill with a rifle is so awesome that he eventually breaks the record for the most confirmed kills in military history. Chris goes on to become a legend in Iraq and keeps signing up for more tours of duty, much to the despair of Taya and their children. When Chris finally decides to come home for good, he finds he can't get the war out of his head -- until he discovers that helping other veterans and victims of PTSD brings him solace.\n______________________________\nTotally, It's a perfect balance - - The meaty action is show in a way you can always see what is happening, something unusual and refreshing in modern films. Although it's a true story, so you might think easy to tell, it takes an artist to tell it in a way that you are by his side throughout the film. It's not made to be over the top, blow your mind entertainment, it's much deeper.
