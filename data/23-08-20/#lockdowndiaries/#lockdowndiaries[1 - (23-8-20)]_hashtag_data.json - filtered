I was going through my photos and came across this one. It was taken when QLD was also in a lockdown few months ago. We had some great family time then, we did a lot of craft, painting, clearing the garden and the house, riding bikes, but it was also challenging at times. I know it is not much, but if you need a chat you can always sent me a DM ❤️. There are some new restrictions which have come in place for QLD, so will see what happens next. \n.\n.\n.\nWe did this hand painting using water based paints and a cotton tip.

From trying to experience as many cultures as possible to looking inwards, remembering forgotten projects and reviving them. \nHaving understood the value of homegrown organic produce a couple of years ago, I was keen to get a little patch going, except for the problem of who would look after it when we traveled. \nBut then came the lockdown -- giving me all the time in the world, and nowhere to go as far as one could see. \nSo I started planting. \nThis little tree, part of a larger \"kitchen garden\" that has miraculously survived despite me, is giving us the most fragrant organic limes I have ever experienced. \nNature showed us her very best; everything that was sowed, took root and thrived without a single chemical being applied. Salads, tomatoes, radish greens, guavas, herbs, mirchis, even a couple of tiny but determined baingan plants valiantly pushing through.... I'm honestly struck by how easy it's been, and how very very rewarding! We now not only have little bits and bobs that make their way into our plates, but also a tiny green patch in the concrete jungle of Gurgaon, for when nerves need calming and minds need centering. #gratitude\n\nOh, and thank you @divaliciousdoc\nFor tagging me #newnormal \n\nHere's hoping to see more perspectives on the New Normal and what it has brought with it:  Tagging @sonataparashar @roytellstales @firepowernaik\n@rilanty\n@shredmatic\n@winter_wanderer\n@shrenikavlani @deeptidhoot \n\n.\n.\n#organicfarming #eatorganic #farmtotable #lockdowndiaries #enjoythelittlethings #deliciousfeeling #makethemostofit","NumberOfLikes":40,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Insiyah Vahanvaty on August 22, 2020.

But this time it wasn't easy. Initially it was going okay and slowly the monotony creeped in. \nThe usual everyday chores seemed super boring and exhausting as well. Without having a help the chores were divided between me and hubby and we still are continuing!!\nThe changes were inevitable. The pandemic, the lockdown has helped me to recentre my being. Helped me to focus, concentrate. Yes there are days when I do not feel okay. I get severely anxious. Yes I do. But unlike before now I can control. I believe in my patience. I strongly feel time will heal everything. \nOn the brighter side, I started spending time on my hobbies more. And I found out I have not one but many hobbies to indulge in!!\nCooking is my all time breather but I have rediscovred my love for painting, gardening. \nSo the lockdown has been quite a challenge but also a boon in disguise !!🤞🏻\nTo sum it up my life in Pandemic has been difficult but learnt few important life lessons.

But this year is so strange - full of unfinished business. We've not been able to plan so much with our summer or book to take Eden on a city break for the first time. Usually I'd be cruising the Halloween section at TKMaxx already (for full time house decor obviously 🎃), but instead we're still avoiding town. It's not to complain - everything can wait and we've been perfectly happy slowing down that pace and making our own fun (even if the social restrictions were hard on everybody). But it's just odd to think about what's happened and what may continue to happen, and this strange \"new normal\" we're raising our children in. 🍁\nIn fact, this year seems to have flown by SO fast - is that just the strangeness of 2020 or is it simply due to having a 15 month old?! 🍂","NumberOfLikes":41,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Little Pack of Vegans on August 21, 2020.

A garden where I can grow lavender and rhubarb and so much more. To once again be able to play a piano, my own piano, learning new songs for no other purpose than my love for the instrument. To establish my own little office, no longer working from an awkward combination of couch\/bed\/coffee table and more. I'll cover the walls with beautiful illustrations created by many of the insanely talented artists here on Instagram. I'll have a yellow rosebush outside our home, similar to this one, slowly trailing up the buildings fasade as the years tick by. \n\nIt's a dream I've been building brick by brick every day throughout lockdown.

After 4 gruelling years of studying her craft, my sister @aana.design graduated from Edinburgh college of art with a BA honours in jewellery and silversmithing. Sadly due to the #covid19 lockdown she never made it to her graduation ceremony or her new designers opportunities in London. After submitting her work to the online graduate show she was shortlisted for the global design graduate showcase awards but her success relies on public votes. She got to this point through her hard work, determination and talent. My bias aside, she is one badass jeweller, pure hearted and deserves to go far. I\u2019m asking you to please support her now by taking less than 60 seconds to vote for her in this competition. Click on the link in my bio, then click on \u201Cvote for Stevie\u201D. This link will take you directly to the voting page. Click on \u201Cvote for this project\u201D and that\u2019s it done. No need to enter your details or anything! Simple and sweet.
