Learn more about this great arist hereüëá\n.\nQ: The most important lesson I've learned as a musician:\nA: To listen. The people you meet as a musician don't really care where you come from because it truly makes no difference. Playing chamber music means that you have to be able to listen, be sensitive, adjust, be able to discuss and help each other to reach the best level possible and do the best we can to make the experience enjoyable for the audience and for us, the musicians. \n.\nQ: These three things got me through the lockdown:\nThe lockdown was a great time to reflect on our lives. I used this time to do more yoga and meditation, which in my opinion kept me sane in these stressful times. I practiced more and tried to develop my ability to use mental practice and planing better, and lastly, I kept in touch with the people I love the most.\n.\n@katrin.spiegel will play at #youngeuroclassic2020 on August 3, serving you some #mozart amongst others.

The pre-recorded interviews take place via Zoom and are posted every Tuesday afternoon. You can find them all on the Different Strokes website, Facebook page and YouTube channel - but over the next couple of weeks, a snippet of each already posted to the DS channels are going to be introduced to our wonderful Instagram audience, to give everyone a taster of personal affiliation with each survivor.\u2063\n\u2063\nLockdown interview number five features stroke survivors Sheelagh and Belinda. Sheelagh is our Administrator at Different Strokes. She had her stroke in 2018 at the age of 51. Belinda had her stroke in 2015 at the age of 47. Belinda spoke to Sheelagh about her Neurofatigue, her process to recovery, the impact lockdown has had on that and how she\u2019s had to adapt with having her Mum in the house when she still needs time alone to manage her condition. She also talks about the little things like how her shopping delivery has become a highlight, how she\u2019s keeping occupied with crafting and colouring and the Different Strokes Facebook group being a game changer for her mentality and wellbeing.\u2063\n\u2063\n Catch the full interview at:\u2063\nüîó https:\/\/differentstrokes.co.uk\/stroke-survivor-experiences-during-lockdown\/\u2063\n‚ñ∂Ô∏è https:\/\/youtu.be\/nNBMW414umk\u2063\nüëçüèº https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/differentstrokescharity\/\u2063\n\u2063\n#stroke #strokesurvivor #strokesurvivors #youngstrokesurvivor #strokesurvivorsneverquit #strokerecovery #strokeawareness #lifeafterstroke #strokestories #strokerehabilitation #strokecare #strokelife #strokewarrior #braininjury #braininjurysurvivor #lockdownlife #lockdowndiaries #stayingconnected #zoommeeting #quarantinelife #quarantinedays #quarantinestories #covid19 #covid2020 #charityorganization #neurofatigue #communitygroup #communitymatters #disability #disabilityservices","NumberOfLikes":25,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1595930195,"LocalDate":"Tue Jul 28 11:56:35 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Pockets of green spaces in my mini haus üå± The #selloum plant on the left was bought from a #neighborhood seller while the #snakeplant on the right was a gift from my beautiful niece Eyre üíï#sanamabuhay #greening #newbie #plantita #mommyj #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":15,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Mommy J in Para√±aque.

Until the past week or so I really couldn\u2019t find balance throughout lockdown. As a hyper sensitive empath the hurt and death of other people hangs around me, the not knowing and not being able to do things I love makes me feel flat. The fact I\u2019ve lost so much weight and muscle from lack of my beloved barbells makes me almost angry after working so hard.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t have the added worry of being vulnerable, being Black and\/or Disabled (and therefore more likely to suffer from C19), I\u2019m not at risk of losing my job and if I did I\u2019d have the funds to secure us for a while. I have a supportive partner and access to free healthcare. \n\nThat\u2019s not to say my problems should be compared. I think we often miss the point when we think of other peoples suffering in comparison it to our own. Every single persons varying struggles are valid. But if we fail to acknowledge that of others too then we fail those people.\n\nLet\u2019s do better to consider ourselves and the people around us, even though restrictions are lifting around the world, millions of people are still at risk. \n\nLet me know some good things you\u2019ve been up to during lockdown? \n___\nAlt text: a white arm wearing a silver bangle reaches the flowing leaves of a Willow tree.","NumberOfLikes":49,"AccessibilityCaption":"a white hand wearing a silver bangle reaches the flowing leaves of a Willow tree.","NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1595881418,"LocalDate":"Mon Jul 27 22:23:38 CEST 2020","Location":"Islington"},{"CaptionText":"Another one of my faves @karlmorris_photography ‚ù§Ô∏è@cavemantraining #gymsharkwomen #puma #lockdowndiaries #fitnessmotivation #fitnessjourney #fitnessgirl #gymmotivation #fitnessgoals #fitnessgirl #airforce1 #nikewomen #gymshoot #karlmorris_photography #cavemantraining #eatwell #eatwellfeelgood #strongwomen #workoutinstyle #bodyconfidencemovement","NumberOfLikes":44,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Do_eat_glow in CAVEMAN TRAINING with @cavemantraining, @gymshark, @gymsharkwomen, @pumawomen, and @karlmorris_photography.

We need to understand that COVID 19 is defined as a \u201CWicked Problem\u201D. Wicked Problems have no clear, cut solutions. The solution depends on how the problem has been defined. Therefore the Pandemic has bred a lot of uncertainty not amongst the population but also amongst those COVID Warriors who have set out to solve it or deal with it. ‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nIf you need information, please get your own information from reliable sources. Social Media Forwards may not be authentic as we can see from the amount of Fake news being circulated.‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nConspiracy theorists also get pretty active for reasons we will discuss in an upcoming blog on COVID 19. Fake News and Conspiracy Theories are stressful and promote fear-mongering. Spare about 15 mins a day to catch up on the news of the day and resist the urge to constantly monitor the news. It will bring about fatigue.
