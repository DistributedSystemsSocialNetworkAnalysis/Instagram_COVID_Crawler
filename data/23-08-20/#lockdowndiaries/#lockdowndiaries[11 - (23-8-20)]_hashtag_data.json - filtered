And in fact the satisfaction I am getting out of a clean sink is like none other these days.  And it\u2019s not because of fear of infection.. maybe because with so much happening outside that I cannot control, this gives me a sense of control.

Like most of you, I\u2019m so flamin\u2019 confused about what we can and can\u2019t do. COVID logic has well and truly set in! But what is absolutely clear, is the importance of wearing a mask or face covering.\n.\n.\nTo help you understand when, where and why, I pulled together the below from a variety of reputable sources. \n.\n. \n⭐️From 24th July, it\u2019s mandatory (the law) to wear a mask or face covering in shops, supermarkets and on public transport in England (rules may differ in other parts of the UK)\n⭐️ This also covers NHS settings, banks, building societies and the post office \n⭐️ Basic rule of thumb; if you\u2019re indoors and in public, you need a face covering\n⭐️ There are exemptions to this, such as restaurants, bars, cafes, visitor attractions, entertainment (e.g. cinema) and sports venues (e.g. gyms)\n⭐️ You can also remove your mask or face covering to eat or drink if you\u2019re in a designated food area, like a food court\n⭐️ Your mask must cover your mouth and nose, be fitted at the side and be comfortable to breath in\n⭐️It is not compulsory for under 11s to wear masks \n⭐️ It\u2019s not recommended that under 3s wear masks or face coverings for health and safety reasons\n⭐️ It\u2019s also advised (although NOT mandatory) to wear face coverings in enclosed public spaces where social distancing is difficult or you\u2019re meeting with people you don\u2019t normally socialise with \n⭐️Masks are largely to protect others, rather than the wearer, as they cover the nose and mouth area, the confirmed sources of main transmission of the virus that causes COVID \n.\n.\nSo in a nutshell, wear a mask or face covering when you\u2019re out and about to protect others. Be a good human and this will be over a heck of a lot quicker!!\n.\n.\nFor more in-depth info, please visit the below sources:\n.\n.\nSources: @nhswebsite @ukgovofficial @simplepolitics","NumberOfLikes":222,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Kelly ⭐️ work\/life juggler ⭐️ on July 26, 2020 tagging @accessorize, and @mimiandlula.

Only weeks after the U.K. included Spain on a list of countries safe for summer holidays, the government reversed course and announced late Saturday it would impose a 14-day quarantine on anyone arriving from Spain. The move came after cases in the country jumped, particularly in the Catalonia region, where authorities are racing to stamp out new outbreaks. Norway on Friday announced a 10-day quarantine for people returning from Spain, and France issued new travel warnings for the Catalonia region, which is home to Barcelona and popular beaches.

Spain\u2019s health ministry reported more than 920 new cases on both Thursday and Friday, the highest numbers since early May, when the government began easing one of Europe\u2019s strictest lockdowns.\n.\n.\nDo follow and share @the_recent.column for latest updates.\n.\n.\n#spain #spainstagram #spaingram #instaspain #recentnews #recentcolumn #worldgram #worldnewsdaily #worldnews #europe #european #pandemic2020 #covid19 #covidnews #florida #norway #barcelonaspain #barcelona #france #uk #french #catalonia #cataloniaroyaltulum #lockdown #lockdown2020 #lockdownlife #lockdowndiaries #tourism #spain_photographs #spain_passion","NumberOfLikes":9,"Hashtags":["#spain","#spainstagram","#spaingram","#instaspain","#recentnews","#recentcolumn","#worldgram","#worldnewsdaily","#worldnews","#europe","#european","#pandemic2020","#covid19","#covidnews","#florida","#norway","#barcelonaspain","#barcelona","#france","#uk","#french","#catalonia","#cataloniaroyaltulum","#lockdown","#lockdown2020","#lockdownlife","#lockdowndiaries","#tourism","#spain_photographs","#spain_passion"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The_Recent.Column on July 26, 2020.

A trench has been built surrounding the fort and is now covered with vegetation. A part of the trench opposite the entrance has been filled to make a road in-way. The two bastions alongside the entrance have been refurbished. The fort has two fortification walls. The outer wall has 18 bastions while the inner one has 8 bastions. The 12 ft base of fortified walls and bastions are built of black rock and the upper remaining part is made of bricks. As we enter the citadel from the inner fortified wall there is a dense vegetation cover and many structural remains have been hidden in here. There is step well.

But it made good table talk and something to giggle about over lunch! \n\nMy dad has also put our long awaited lounge mirror up for us which is now bringing the room together so thank you dad~ {see stories for its new home}\n\nHope you have all enjoyed your Saturday! \n\n#familytime #nextofficial #nexthome #mirror #comingtogetherslowly #lockdowndiaries #grandparents #mytinymoments #comxfamsum \n#documentyourdays #magicofchildhood #ourcandidlife #ourtinymoments #capture_your_stories #discoverunder5k #Happy_life_captures #unitedinstaparents #delight_in_childhood #sainsburysbaby #tuclothing #summervibes #mumssupportingmums\n#makingmemories #lifewithlittles\n#ourclickdays #snapfromtheheart #makingmemories #parentsquad #mammabear","NumberOfLikes":257,"Hashtags":["#familytime","#nextofficial","#nexthome","#mirror","#comingtogetherslowly","#lockdowndiaries","#grandparents","#mytinymoments","#comxfamsum","#documentyourdays","#magicofchildhood","#ourcandidlife","#ourtinymoments","#capture_your_stories","#discoverunder5k","#Happy_life_captures","#unitedinstaparents","#delight_in_childhood","#sainsburysbaby","#tuclothing","#summervibes","#mumssupportingmums","#makingmemories","#lifewithlittles","#ourclickdays","#snapfromtheheart","#makingmemories","#parentsquad","#mammabear"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by 𝘑 𝘦 𝘴 𝘴 𝘪 𝘤 𝘢 in Stoke-on-Trent.

In 1672, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj captured it from Adilshah. The first to be seen on this fort is the Hemadpanthi temple of Bhairavnath with a different style. There are overlays, arches and lanterns around the temple. There is a flagpole and a cannon on the bastion in front of the temple. As you walk along the path behind the temple, you will see a magnificent mansion built of laterite stone. There are remnants of main court on the fort. As you walk along the footpath near the fort, you come across the magnificent Dudhsagar Lake. The water in it has become milky in color due to the properties of the soil. There is a beautiful armed idol of Adishakti Bhavani Mata in the ruined Bhavani Mandir near the lake. If you continue on the straight path to the east, there is remnant of an entrance of the fort. There are 2 dry wells and two lakes.\n\n@virajt_dd11 @girlonthemountains @rupali_kamtekar @aniketkhedekar_ @shodhashodh @jayedeepjagtap1 and Me 😉","NumberOfLikes":79,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1595692517,"LocalDate":"Sat Jul 25 17:55:17 CEST 2020","Location":"Bhudargad Fort"},{"Owner":"the_pictoguise","CaptionText":"#rainlily #yellowrainlily #mansoon #flowers #blooms  #uttrakhand_dairies #phonograph #phoneographic #phonewallpapers  #mobilephotography #instaphotos #instaphotography #the_pictoguise #bas_yoon_hi  #oppoa52020 #whiteflowers #realcolors #nofilters #summer #lockdowndiaries  #etsy #shutterstock #alamy #fotomoto #crestock #500px #naturepicturelibrary #istockphoto #midenpictures #canstockphoto","NumberOfLikes":23,"Hashtags":["#rainlily","#yellowrainlily","#mansoon","#flowers","#blooms","#uttrakhand_dairies","#phonograph","#phoneographic","#phonewallpapers","#mobilephotography","#instaphotos","#instaphotography","#the_pictoguise","#bas_yoon_hi","#oppoa52020","#whiteflowers","#realcolors","#nofilters","#summer","#lockdowndiaries","#etsy","#shutterstock","#alamy","#fotomoto","#crestock","#500px","#naturepicturelibrary","#istockphoto","#midenpictures","#canstockphoto"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The_Pictoguise in Uttarakhand.

Don't make the mixture too thin. It should coat the potatoes well.\n\nNow deep fry them. Don't make it brown as you have to fry them for a second time to make it crispy. Once 1st round of deep frying is down let the potatoes rest for 5 mins then deepfry again till golden brown.\n\nNow for the sauce mixture, mix all the ingredients in a bowl, add some water and keep aside.\n\nIn the pan add some oil, chopped garlic, onion and bell peppers. Saute well and add the sauce mixture. Check if you require some salt as soya sauce has a lot of salt content in it already.\nOnce the mixture starts to thicken, add the potatoes and give it a light mix.

I\u2019ve missed you all but it\u2019s been a crazy week and we had to much to do, I couldn\u2019t spare a minute for Instagram. Apologies but I know you understand.\n\nSo two quick things I wanted to tell you...\nFirstly here in the UK we have all got to wear our masks inside for various places starting today. Well this morning I went to get petrol(gas for my American friends) where I had my very first interaction with people that morning. It was not a good one. I was heart broken to see a poor shop assistant pleeding with a man to put a face covering on. No one deserves to be spoken to like that poor woman was. She was just doing her job and trying to keep herself safe as well as customers who may be vulnerable. So today we wanted to give you a kind and friendly reminder to please cover your face and wash your hands!\n\nNo one wants to wear these stupid masks and no one wants to be in the midst of a pandemic but here we are! So let\u2019s all remember to be kind, sympathetic and understanding! If you really don\u2019t want to wear a mask then that is totally fine, there are plenty of great options that mean you don\u2019t have to go into the shops. The man at the petrol station today could have paid at the pump and avoided ever entering the store. If you need shopping, get home delivery! There is no reason to treat others badly just get a mask or don\u2019t go in!\n\nRant over! 😂\n\nMy next thing that I wanted to say is that we have a very special house guest staying for two weeks! (Check out our stories!) She\u2019s staying at the wonky dog hotel while her family are on vacation! Her mom and I discussed it a long time ago, neither of us wanted her staying in kennels so it just made sense that she came back for a visit! We are reintroducing everyone tonight but we\u2019ve been home for an hour and it\u2019s already like she never left!\n.\n.\n.\n#weareinthistogether #wearamask #wearyourmask #😷 #wearadamnmask #bemoremaggie #coronavirusmemes #coronavirus #coronamemes #lockdowndiaries #loc","NumberOfLikes":18,"Hashtags":["#Repost","#weareinthistogether","#wearamask","#wearyourmask","#😷","#wearadamnmask","#bemoremaggie","#coronavirusmemes","#coronavirus","#coronamemes","#lockdowndiaries","#loc"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by HuellitasGochas on July 25, 2020.
