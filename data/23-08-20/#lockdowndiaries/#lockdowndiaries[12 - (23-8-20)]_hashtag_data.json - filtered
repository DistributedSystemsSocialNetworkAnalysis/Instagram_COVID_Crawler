I realise we are entering the peak of the pandemic and that our community transmission is not under control. Therefore  closing schools is in line with the  @who guidelines. Still it doesn't sit well with my heart.\n.\nMany of these children have just gotten back into the routine of school and have finally gotten the hang of the new strict COVID procedures and taking them out now has such far reaching consequences. Not just academically but emotionally as well. \nThe fact that it is only public schools is also a little disheartening because for so many school is their safe haven especially now with so many parents back at work.\n.\nThe closures place many children in unsafe child care positions and its not easy for everyone to hire extra help especially when every cent is already accounted for. I feel like this is one of those anti poor policies that did not take into account the demographics of students in public schools.\n.\nI have no answers tonight and it doesn't seem anyone else does. So for tonight I urge you all to say a little prayer for all the children that are about to lose the safety of school for the next 4 weeks.\n.\n.\n.\n#TorensMama #pretoriamom #pretoriablogger #southafricanblogger #lockdowndiaries #schoolclosures","NumberOfLikes":46,"Hashtags":["#TorensMama","#pretoriamom","#pretoriablogger","#southafricanblogger","#lockdowndiaries","#schoolclosures"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Karen Rivet-Ratshivhombela on July 24, 2020.

Link to the song is in my bio. \n\nWhen the #lockdown had first started in India, was unsure on what to do next.. The #commercial impact apart, there was a likely #creative impact too.. So decided to just work out a way to make a song end-to-end at home itself with whatever resources that were available.. Taking a simple progression & a simple thought ahead \" I'll be there you \" was born.. Little did I expect the feedback that was to follow and now that Songdew came forward to take it up for a digital platforms release, it is one of the most fulfilling moments to have my first effort in production reach this far.. \n\nAcknowledging the importance of the moment, I did get the song re-mastered at @graysparkaudio so that it's fit for release on #streamingplatforms so thanks to @ronakrunwal for giving it the finishing touch. \n\nSorry for the long post..

It is important to speak out loud. Before anything, we are an individuals who must have knowledge to fight for their own rights. One of the most obnoxious is the domestic violence. I don't know why people afraid of speaking about this. Just for the sake of so called \"Chaar Log\". No, they don't matter more than you. Afraid of how society will treat. It's important to talk. Talk about anything bad happening with you. If someone try to keep your mouth shut with popular sayings like \"Arre Har Ghar Me Aisa Hota Hai\" That's where the problem began. \"AGAR AISA HOTA HAI, TO NAHI HONA CHAHIYE\". One more important thing to talk about is violence or mental health of boys. There are lots of cases when domestic violence happened with boys. But they afraid to talk about because of so called society norms of toxic masculinity. There is nothing wrong if you cry in public.\n \"Tmhare mardangi me koi aanch nhi aayegi\"\nThere are lots of cases when no FIR drafted for the molestation or Brutality on boys. It is important to bring all those things in notice now. Its time to normalize a girl being tough and a guy being soft. There is nothing bad in that. Bad situation arises when you play with someone's emotions,  bully someone, becoming reason for someone's mental trauma. Let me ask you one question:\nThose so called masculinity flag bearers who molest a guy because of their sexuality or any possible cause. Don't you think they are not aware of their own sexuality?? Why in any reason a straight people having anything with same sex? Think about it..\nP. S: Creativity is something that fascinates me alot. This picture is my first make up trial.

Later when i am free , i open the notebooks and look for the meanings of the jotted words from dictionary. This, i am doing since two years, but this thing has  become more fun for me during this lockdown, with no tuitions and work, this thing is serving as an amusing game or timepass,you can say. Every evening after having tea, i sit down with my notebooks accompanied with dictionary and make friendship with new words. \nIt is helping me to overcome my boredom, you see. :) \nReally, books are our truest friend, they can help us in so many ways.\nI don't know if this makes sense to anyone, but i am kinda addicted to this thing now.\n.\nI conceived this idea of documenting all the mundane things around me which keep me alive and help me to be contented with my day to day life.\nThese covid days are gloomy, grey and chaotic.

Shopping Fast Fashion - Fashion is the world\u2019s second most polluting industry all thanks to fast fashion\u2019s cheap and unscrupulous processes. Buy less and choose better. Follow the #30wears rule. \n\n2. Traditional calendars - Don\u2019t you think calendars are among the most wasteful single-use products? This year I shifted to a plantable calendar bought from @ecoindian  and FYI I\u2019m growing tomatoes, marigold and tulsi this year 🌿\n\n3. Tumble drying your clothes - \nAn average drying-machine cycle uses just over 4kWh of energy and produces around 1.8kg CO2. If all households with a tumble dryer dried one load of washing outside each week, instead of by machine, they would save over a million tonnes of CO2 in a year. \nIn short, tumble dry sucks so pls dry your clothes in the sun🌞\n\n4. Animal tested skincare - There is just no excuse for using products that have been tested on animals. And it\u2019s unfortunate that a lot of big brands still do animal testing but the good news is that there are SO MANY new, small and local brands that are cruelty free, organic and a lot of other awesome things. \n\n5. Don\u2019t be a spectator. Take action - Sustainability is a way of life that appreciates all forms of life and provides the pathways for collective prosperity. The time to watch from the sidelines is long gone. You are a key part of this global revolution. Realise your responsibility and act on it. \n\nThat\u2019s it for now! I hope these points get you thinking and that you can start making more informed and responsible lifestyle choices💫\n\nStay strong, stay safe 🌸\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n#sustainablefashion #sustainableliving #consciousliving #naturelover #traveldiaries #stylediaries #lifestyle #goodvibesonly #instadaily #lifestyleblogger #ootdfashion #healthylifestyle #quarantinelife #lockdowndiaries #goodvibesonly✨ #igfashion","NumberOfLikes":351,"Hashtags":["#30wears","#sustainablefashion","#sustainableliving","#consciousliving","#naturelover","#traveldiaries","#stylediaries","#lifestyle","#goodvibesonly","#instadaily","#lifestyleblogger","#ootdfashion","#healthylifestyle","#quarantinelife","#lockdowndiaries","#goodvibesonly✨","#igfashion"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Sanah Mehra in Planet Earth with @sanahsharmaofficial.

Ever felt as if no one understands\/feels you?\nA. This book does. \n\nThis book is addressed to a stranger (the reader) about whom the writer doesn't know but feels. It includes 30 poems and letters on various topics such as pain, anxiety, heartache, health, positivity, second chances, failure, kindness, happiness and many more. The book represents a 30 day journey for self-discovery. I thought to give it a read as it was lockdown and everything was dark, this book proved to be that little beacon of light. The language is easy and there is no age bar. The book is absolute perfect for the new readers as well as non-readers as well. Maybe at times, it would happen that the book feels long, less engaging or less connect as compared to fiction books. I would recommend to read the book at least once to everyone as it is important for self. Precisely, one unique book of it's own kind which everyone can have. \n\nRating: 3.8\/5.0\n.\n#dovishsoul #dovishpoety #bookreview #dearstranger #ashishbagrecha #bookstagram #bookaholic #lockdowndiaries #lettertostrangers #30days30letters #poetsofinstagram #readersofinstagram #we_write","NumberOfLikes":74,"Hashtags":["#dovishsoul","#dovishpoety","#bookreview","#dearstranger","#ashishbagrecha","#bookstagram","#bookaholic","#lockdowndiaries","#lettertostrangers","#30days30letters","#poetsofinstagram","#readersofinstagram","#we_write"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Jill Somani on July 23, 2020 tagging @ashish.bagrecha.

Our approach to learning can be summed up as \u201CRead great books, and lots of them.\u201D Between my four school-age kids, we used all these books today. We take a Charlotte Mason approach to learning, where we spread a feast of subjects for the student, letting them sample a little each day on multiple topics. Most of the books here are spread out over a term, some over the year. Each child has many more for the year than what I\u2019ve pictured, and I haven\u2019t included our English curriculum or the maths I use with my younger two students. We use the Catholic Charlotte Mason curriculum, Mater Amabilis, as the source of most of our book choices, with a few modifications for our family.
