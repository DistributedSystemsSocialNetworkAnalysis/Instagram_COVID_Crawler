The pre-recorded interviews take place via Zoom and are posted every Tuesday afternoon. You can find them all on the Different Strokes website, Facebook page and YouTube channel - but over the next couple of weeks, a snippet of each already posted to the DS channels are going to be introduced to our wonderful Instagram audience, to give everyone a taster of personal affiliation with each survivor.\u2063\n\u2063\nLockdown interview number two features stroke survivors Sheelagh and Pamela. Sheelagh is our Administrator at Different Strokes. She had her stroke in 2018 at the age of 51. Pamela is a regular attendee of the DS Carlisle support group and had her stroke 4 and a half years ago. Pamela spoke to Sheelagh about disruption to her rehab progress, missing face to face contact but appreciating the ropes of technology, and using this time to achieve goals and paint her stroke experience as a positive advantage.

During the early days of quarantine, a time when most people in our neighborhood were still very much scared to go out, a husband and wife tandem started selling food here in our place, which they sell thru the Facebook Messenger group chat created specifically to let homeowners sell their goods.\n▪️\nOne of the many dishes I bought from them was this tub of Pansit Palabok, for only 60 pesos (a little over 1usd). It was a different kind of Pansit Palabok - it wasn\u2019t saucy at all, but cooked a la Pansit Bihon Guisado - but it sure tasted great. \n▪️\nUnfortunately, when the quarantine got a little flexible and people started going out (we still don\u2019t have public transportation in the area), they started losing customers and when the husband returned to work, the wife had a difficulty cooking and delivering goods by herself, that they stopped selling.\n▪️\nI hope they\u2019d return, even during weekends. Every food I bought from them tasted good, never had any complaints, and their business grew significantly in that short amount of time. At first they didn\u2019t care much about presentation until one person expressed her dismay, which made them change their whole way of doing the business. Sure there are some food sellers that are still thriving, and some new players entered the game offering more choices, but I miss eating their food.\n▪️\nAs for me, it did come across my mind to sell food, too... but I am alone. Just doing everything all by myself - going to the market, preparing, cooking, packing, delivering... all using my two legs and hands (as we don\u2019t have any vehicle), plus answering to inquires, seemed a little too much for me to bear. If my mom and sister were here, we\u2019d push for it. \n______________\n#pansitpalabok #pancitpalabok #pansit #pancit #lockdowndiaries #fooddelivery #food #foodphotography #foodstagram #foodstagramph #filipinofood #filipinocuisine #lutongpinoy #lutongbahay #foodtrip #seemslegeat #eatpilipinas #kainpilipinas #pagkaingpinoy #kainpinoy #foodinspiration","NumberOfLikes":45,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Jenny Jayne in Caloocan.

I specially had to leave a load of dirty dishes this weekend so that we can check if it's fixed. That's our story and we're sticking to it. \n- This morning Pieter took his laptop to the I-Store to have it fixed and we were delighted when he returned with it, it didn't have to go in. If only there was an I-Store for dishwashers.\n- We had a specialist cleaning team come clean the entire office, 2 professionals showed up, strangely enough the one professional was in a baby carrier strapped onto the other professional. \n- Pieter worked very hard to catch up on his productivity having missed some time driving to the I-Store. Co-worker Marli took pity on him and helped him with his call with the CEO. \n- Pieter also spent a lot of effort prepping bread dough for us that had to be sprayed with water and turned every hour. Then Kevin showed up and grabbed the wrong bottle when he tried to help Pieter, Kevin sprayed our bread with the bottle of disinfectant in stead if the water bottle next to it.

For someone that finds so much happiness in making women look and feel beautiful, I realized I didn\u2019t even feel my best. I was always that girl that wore baggy clothing to cover up my body. It was my comfort blanket, it covered my insecurities and it worked for a bit. I used to LOVE wearing sarees, it was one of my favourite attires, BUT that changed. All of last year, wearing a saree to weddings (including my own wedding) was honestly one of the scariest things for me. I felt BEYOND insecure. \n\nThankfully, that feeling started to change recently. A couple months ago, I decided I\u2019ll make the change for myself and started intermittent fasting AND a vegetarian ketogenic diet (which is much harder than a regular ketogenic diet). I consume less carbs and barely no sugar. I have been very strict, except when my sister in law bakes cupcakes (only time it\u2019s worth it) 😊\n\nWhen I started the diet, I was my heaviest. Now, I can proudly say I\u2019ve lost 25 lbs in the last couple months and  I\u2019m a size and a half down 🤭 a lot more work to go but the goal is to lose another 25 and then start incorporating carbs back into my diet. Point is, do whatever it takes to keep your mental heath stable. My whole life, I\u2019ve let all the negative comments from those RUDE ASS AUNTIES\/UNCLES let me believe I was fat or ugly. Little did I know, I was always the size I wanted to be. I just didn\u2019t know. You get to choose what keeps you happy. I don\u2019t know how others feel, but this lockdown changed my view of EVERYTHING. \n.\n.\n.\nTOP: @tiabhuva \n.\n.\n.\n#aboutme #lockdowndiaries #weightloss #ketoweightloss","NumberOfLikes":404,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by H A I R.

But now it\u2019s one of my favorite parts of my day! Despite the benefits of getting out in the sunshine and fresh air, I\u2019ve noticed my body responds much better to gentle and frequent movement (rather than trying to cram a day\u2019s worth of movement into one HIIT session).⠀\n⠀\n🍳 I used to skip breakfast and wait until I was absolutely starving before I\u2019d eat something, which then made it harder to make healthy choices at lunch. Not having a commute has left me with more time in the mornings so I\u2019ve begun making breakfast every day, whether it\u2019s just a smoothie or something more substantial. Starting my day with a meal that includes protein, produce, fiber, and fat (PPFF) has  been a game changer for my mood and energy levels by keeping my blood sugar stable and keeping me full for hours.⠀\n⠀\n😷 Living through a pandemic has given many of us a newfound respect for our health! I used to suffer through a cold and ignore my body\u2019s signals when it told me to slow down, but now I am super tuned in 📡 to what my body needs. I\u2019ve become much more intentional about taking care of my health, both mentally and physically, and it\u2019s definitely a habit I plan to take with me into the future. ⠀\n⠀\nWhat are some habits you want keep post-lockdown?

Finally Stepped out of my house after almost 3 months. First Stop:- M.A.C.! @maccosmeticsindia My Shopoholic soul needed some retail therapy. Bought 2 Lipsticks\/ Liquid Lip Colours from Their Newly Launched Powder Kiss Liquid Lipstick Formulas. Wearing \u2018Sorry Not Sorry\u2019.. A Gorgeous Soft Coral\/Orangy shade. \n\nI also experimented blending this shade with M.A.C\u2019s Classic Matte Lipstick in the colour \u2018Yash\u2019. The result was a Lighter, Muted peach version of this colour. \nBasically have tried all tips and tricks to check its versatility. Since It\u2019s on the expensive side, & Due to the current COVID scenario, you cannot try it on in the stores. So if you\u2019re unsure how this formulation will look on your complexions, then I suggest you wait. (Speaking From Personal Experience:- As mentioned Above.., I Bought The Classic Matte Lipstick in \u2018Yash\u2019 online. It\u2019s A gorgeous nude that completely washed out my complexion. It looks lovely on Indian skin tones though. Mine unfortunately is extremely fair with a prominent pink undertone so it didn\u2019t suit me. Hence, I\u2019m now left with no other choice besides using it as a Blending medium for my other darker shaded lipsticks). Hope this review helps all my kindred spirited lipstick addict friends here.
