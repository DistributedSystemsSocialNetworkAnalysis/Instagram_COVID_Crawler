It is also important, from time to time, to recreate your process or find new ways to approach it. While slowly engaging with it over time may be optimal, a workshop space wherein a master-trainer brings to the floor the extract of decades of their practice allows swift takeaways in a succinct intensive program.\nNavrasa Sadhana workshop pushed me out of the state of limbo that I had gone into during the initial months of the lockdown. The workshop was organized by Natana Kairali  conducted virtually under the avid guidance of Koddiyattam Master Venu G. The participants constituted fifteen dancers and theatre artists from across the world. In this new online format I craved for the physical ambience, Venu G.\u2019s physical presence, and the live reverberation of the mizhavu during the course of the workshop. However, in attending it virtually from my own personal space, I created the physical world of the workshop around me and discovered that Navrasa Sadhana did not have to exist in a Koothambalam, the ideal performance space for Koodiyattam, but it co-existed with me for me to inhabit it. I could enter this world whenever I wished and it is always accessible to me.\nThe Sadhana is not meditative in the conventional sense. There is too much movement: chaos, noise, jumping, screaming, howling, roaring, killing, and even being killed. But those are only initial stimulants which nudge you to move beyond your body-identity. Exploring each sthayi bhaav through the course, as I delved deeper, the stimulants propelled me further, but gradually, the heroes, the situations, the plot and the battlefield began to fade. All that remained were the traces of an encounter with the emotion in abstract. Navarasa Sadhana is then not mere \u2018practice\u2019, it is indeed sadhana involving all your senses and emotions, and makes you want to travel to that world over and over again, immerse in it, and then emerge out of it changed, cleansed, catharsis-ed...\n(Sharing few glimpses of the workshop with fellow artists.)","NumberOfLikes":17,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1595237626,"LocalDate":"Mon Jul 20 11:33:46 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"3rookiecooks","CaptionText":"Catch the oppor-TUNA-ty, don\u2019t let it swim away🐟 🇯🇵 #rookiescooktheworld \n\n\u20226-minutes Seared Tuna Steak\u2022\nPescatarian\u2022Easy-Peazy\u2022Asian-Fusion \n\nRecipe from: Bowl of Delicious https:\/\/www.bowlofdelicious.com\/six-minute-seared-ahi-tuna-steaks\/ @bowlofdelicious \n\nVal\u2019s rating:\nEasiness to make: 🏅🏅 🏅 🏅 🏅\nYumminess:👌👌👌👌👌\n\nMy alterations 🥣\n1.

She loved the way the room looked 😊😊. \nAll these decorations were purchased from @amazondotin \n.\nI'm generally torn when I have to choose between using and avoiding balloons since they aren't environment friendly, but if a child has been in lockdown for 4 months and this can bring a wider smile to their face, it gets difficult not to give in..\n.\nHer gorgeous and scrumptious birthday cake was from my go to @matissecakedesign and it tasted like heaven. \n.\nI know kids love their regular birthday parties, but virtual birthdays are just so stress free a easy to manage. I hope I don't get used to them 🤪.\nWhat do you think? Should virtual birthday parties become a norm? 😁\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#lockdownbirthday #birthdaygirl #lockdowndiaries #7thbirthday #littlebiggirl #letthembelittle #lockdownwithkids #lockdownparenting #makingmemories #stayhome #staysafe #staypositive #parenthood_moments #mylittlepony #mlp","NumberOfLikes":105,"Hashtags":["#lockdownbirthday","#birthdaygirl","#lockdowndiaries","#7thbirthday","#littlebiggirl","#letthembelittle","#lockdownwithkids","#lockdownparenting","#makingmemories","#stayhome","#staysafe","#staypositive","#parenthood_moments","#mylittlepony","#mlp"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":37,"Timestamp":1595236415,"LocalDate":"Mon Jul 20 11:13:35 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"upalkarmakar","CaptionText":"#mondaymotivation\n#lockdown\n#lockdowndiaries\n\nSo proud to see these guys move on!\n\nI hope I am sending the message that it is possible for anyone who is willing start their journey and do the right things.

Alberobello literally translates to \u2018Beautiful Tree\u2019. The Trulli or the beautiful houses with the conical roofs have an interesting story. History has it that back in the 15th century, every settlement was subjected to a tribute that had to be paid to the kingdom of Naples. The Counts who were the owners of the territory of Alberobello, merrily passed that on to the residents, of course. To work around this, the peasants decided to build their dwellings dry, without using mortar, so that they could be configured as precarious buildings and easily demolished. So technically, they were not a settlement:)\nHaving to use only stones, the peasants found in the round form with the self-supporting domed roof the simplest configuration. The roofs were embellished with decorative pinnacles representing the signature of the architect \u2018Master Trullaro\u2019. I like the idea of a bunch of peasants sitting around with the latest tax decree in their hands, thinking of how to get around it and coming up with the Trulli. Ladies and Gentlemen, you\u2019re looking at one of earliest recorded successful attempts at tax evasion. Full marks for getting around the system, and looking great while you\u2019re at it! Oh and the peasants last laugh is now a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site.

No one knows. The title of official ice cream inventor has never been awarded. What we do know is, as far back as 200 B.C., people have enjoyed variations of frozen treats. Alexander the Great loved snow flavoured with honey and nectar, biblical references have been made to King Solomon\u2019s desire of iced drinks, and Nero Claudius Caesar was known to send servants to the mountains for snow to then be flavoured with fruits and juices. However, it is the Chinese who are most often credited with the invention of today\u2019s ice cream. They figured out that packing snow into a bowl of rice and milk made a tasty treat. Then a thousand years later, Marco Polo returned home from a trip to the Far East with a recipe similar to modern day sherbet. The craze quickly spread throughout Europe\u2019s upper class, and royalty during the 1500s.\n.\n.\n\nIndia, on the other hand, boasts of an impressive history of ice cream as well. In the sixteenth century, Mughal rulers were known to send relays of horsemen to collect and transport ice from Hindu Kush to Delhi, in order to make fruit sorbets. Kulfi, referred to as the \u201Ctraditional ice cream of India\u201D, also originated in the sixteenth century, during the Mughal reign.\n\nAt present, India stands as the world\u2019s fastest growing ice cream market. As per reports, the ice cream sales in India have increased by 13 per cent per year over the last 7 years.\n.\nHappy world Ice Cream day 🍦 \n.\n#icecream #chocolateicecream #almondicecream #roastedalmondicecream #lockdown #homemade  #homechef #chocolatealmondicecream #qurantinecooking #lockdowncooking #lockdowndiaries #chocolatesauce #yummy #yummyinthetummy #dessert #desserts #summertime #coolcoolicecream #worldicecreamday #happyworldicecreamday","NumberOfLikes":27,"Hashtags":["#icecream","#chocolateicecream","#almondicecream","#roastedalmondicecream","#lockdown","#homemade","#homechef","#chocolatealmondicecream","#qurantinecooking","#lockdowncooking","#lockdowndiaries","#chocolatesauce","#yummy","#yummyinthetummy","#dessert","#desserts","#summertime","#coolcoolicecream","#worldicecreamday","#happyworldicecreamday"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by All things food in Delhi - NCR with @theterracekitchen.

If you may have observed my profile, in most of my pictures I can be found serious. Only two or three pictures are there in which a thin and feeble arch on my face could be observed. I was never like that. As everything has reason, this has too. When I look myself in the mirror, the figure in the mirror world taunts me without saying, \"why so serious?\", and I, helpless, give no answer, because I know smile is a natural thing, and it couldn't be produced artificially or deliberately. People often, when see me serious-faced, suggest me to light up my face with a smile, and I feign a curve, which looks horrible, as though I have inserted two fingers at the ends of my lips and extended them upward, drawing an arc. I don't want to smile, even then I do it. I hurt myself . . . just for them, for their satisfaction. They act as if how much they care about me, but in reality they show-off that fake caring just to convince themselves that they are kind, even though they aren't. I have always done the thing which they wanted, not what I wanted. That's how my smile was snatched and disappeared; like genie. \nNow when I don't do what they say, they proclaim me an arrogant and selfish. They believe that self-love is a sign of arrogance and selfishness. That's the face of our society.\nIn this cruel world, which does not regret for ruining your childhood, no one is yours except your mother (probably father as well).\n\n#pravinpoetry #joker #hate #love #lockdowndiaries #motivationalquotes #sadquotes #lifelessons #hope #sacrifice #quotes #hindi #kind #honest #depression #mentalhealth #smile #happinessquotes #happylife #blacklivesmatter #mankind #universe #galaxy #marvel #poetry #inspiration #instapoetry #greatvibes #desire #death","NumberOfLikes":17,"Hashtags":["#pravinpoetry","#joker","#hate","#love","#lockdowndiaries","#motivationalquotes","#sadquotes","#lifelessons","#hope","#sacrifice","#quotes","#hindi","#kind","#honest","#depression","#mentalhealth","#smile","#happinessquotes","#happylife","#blacklivesmatter","#mankind","#universe","#galaxy","#marvel","#poetry","#inspiration","#instapoetry","#greatvibes","#desire","#death"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Pravin Gupta on July 19, 2020.

Or life throws tantrums at you? I immediately go back to my forever watchlist!\n\n✨ I'd start with the series that's my all the me favourite and even while I'm writing this Instagram post, Miranda Hobbes is staring at me from laptop screen. I mean how could someone exist and not love this?\n\n✨The second one would be quite obvious after this, both the shows ran at the same era and both shows have a plot entirely based on friendship. I can tell now that I am over F.R.I.E.N.D.S., but I kind of  waiting till my next me tal breakdown to take place, and bang! I'd be binge-watching the show for nights!\n\n✨ I don't love Sex and the City movies as much as the series, but still they're my instant mood lifters! Both movies 1 and 2 are my \n\"fashion extravaganza\" escape forever!\n\n✨10 things I hate about you, I entirely watch it from the love and memories of Heath Ledger. Plus, the movie is a very good refreshment!\n\n✨ I've watched Eat,Prey, Love over and over again, at the lowest point of times. Julia Roberts is the reason and soul searching is the cause for this choice.\n\n✨ People who've already familiar with what 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' a masterpiece is have never got over it! Nor did I! I occasionally watch it when I get very emotional at times. And somehow it still manages to mesmerize me like it did at the very first time!\n\n✨ Forrest Gump has the very same reason like the previous one! I never got over it! And I don't think I ever will!\n\n✨ When I want to believe that, 'Love conquers  us all\", I immediately get back to 'The Holiday', obvious reasons are the ensemble cast and of course a younger Jude Law, and in fact the love stories that I solely want to believe in. 🥺\n\n✨ Anne with an E is the youngest watch to be in the list. But I'd stand by my choice, I have never came across such a show that feels exactly I'm going from one page of a book to another, while painting a beautiful picture myself.\n\nWhat show\/movie you never got over with?
