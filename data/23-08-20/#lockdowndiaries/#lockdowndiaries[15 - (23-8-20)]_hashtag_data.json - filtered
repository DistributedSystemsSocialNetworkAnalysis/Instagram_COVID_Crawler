I am a product of it and now I work actively to make it better. However, my heart goes out to the little ones who are struggling to fit into the requirements of rote learning even in progressive boards. I cannot even begin to think about the plight of students in state and other boards. \n \nA 5 year old is expected to write paragraphs and learn long spellings. A kid who is fairly smart when it comes to making sense of the world around her, telling stories and art & craft breaks down completely when she is made to write. Then she is told she is not writing \u2018beautifully\u2019 or her spellings are wrong. A mother who recognizes her child\u2019s very many gifts gives into the peer pressure and scolds her for \u2018not trying enough\u2019. Even as these words leave her mouth she knows how unfair she is being and chides herself ever so often to let the little one be. \n.\nWhy can\u2019t we make unstructured play a part of the learning process even when kids proceed to senior classes? How can a student grow up suddenly in a matter of weeks just because they have moved from \u201Cpre-school\u201D to \u201Cprimary\u201D school? Why are we so hell bent on factory producing the skill sets of our kids? How difficult is it to bring personalized education in the classroom? \n \nAs a parent and an educator I ponder on these points quite often. Many times I give in to the pressure and expect my kid to toe the line. Other times sense prevails and I let her be.  Schools are not going to change anytime soon as much as we hope. What we can change is our attitude towards learning.\n \nAfter all Gen- Alpha (as kids of millennial parents are referred to) will go on to do jobs that don\u2019t even exist yet and with AI in it's full bloom. Why then do we continue to teach them the way we taught a decade ago?\n.\n.\nIy is wearing zero power computer glasses\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#tobecontinued #weekendrant #littleone #indianeducationsystem #primaryeducation #ahmedabad #ahmedabadblogger #homeschooling #lockdowndiaries #learningbydoing #screentime #onlineschool","NumberOfLikes":1252,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Juhi Bansal in Ahmedabad, India with @kidsstoppress, @worldofmoms, @momspresso, @tweakindia, and @workingmomsofahmedabad.

Let the steak rest for half of the cooking time before you eat it\n\nFun fact 🎁\nThe filet mignon is from the small end of the tenderloin area of the animal, which is non-weight bearing and not toughened by exercise, resulting in extremely tender meat.

Although, truth be told, we haven\u2019t done any formal learning at all since the schools closed in March.  This was a conscious decision. \n\nIn March my children were 6 and a half (in year 2), 4 and a half (doing 2 days a week at nursery) and 6 months.  My husband works full time and I am on maternity leave.  Practically, with that age combination, it would have been very difficult and stressful to attempt much sit down style learning.  But more than that, I believe children in England start school too young, that school is too formal and adult led too quickly, and that the year 2 SATS are a terrible idea.  We embraced the opportunity to prioritise the things we think are important in childhood.  Our home education has consisted of walking, reading, watching films and free play. \n\nMy children have gone through real waves of emotion.  Much of the early months was really positive.  My husband\u2019s work took a long time to sort out remote access so we were able to spend a lot of time together.  We were bereaved twice in these first weeks of the pandemic and so sad not to see my parents particularly as my dad is very poorly.  The time together enabled us to support the children and deeply explore our family philosophy and values.\n\nRecent weeks have been harder.  The 6 year old is missing some of the freedom and independence he had, and the 4 year old misses the opportunity to play without being dictated to by his brother.  I fell down a rabbit hole of anxiety although with the help of medication, the perinatal mental health team and family support I have pulled myself out.  Some people have asked whether we will be sending the boys back to school and the answer is yes.  The 6 year old really misses his school friends and the 4 year old is desperate to start school.  It\u2019s a rite of passage that we have talked about so much over the years and now is not the time to take that away from him.  I want to go back to work and give my left brain some of the action.  But I am nervous about what school in a pandemic will look like (continued in comments)...","NumberOfLikes":22,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Tessa 💚 she\/her on July 18, 2020.

In our individual lives and across the world. \n\nSome of us with privilege are finally waking up to it. Tentatively, but still, so.\n\nSome of us face our demons during lockdown - whether that\u2019s too much time with ourselves, our families or a resetting of identity as we grieve what is lost.\n\nSome of us had to focus on just waking up each day and continuing.\n\nLook at us, in all our ugliness and our beauty. How many of us, despite being afraid, reach for the opportunity to grow. Like plants leaning into sunshine. Like caterpillars into butterflies 🦋 \n\nIn all the chaos there can be pockets of growth and change, little sprouts of hope. Clarity and balance so we can make conscious change.\n\nWhere have you grown? What\u2019s different about you since this all began? I\u2019d love to know. I\u2019m much more committed to rituals of self-care than ever. It took a while to choose this path, but I love it now.\n\nIf you need more mental balance in the chaos, join me online with @tringyogastudio on Sunday (tomorrow) 7pm UK time for a FREE meditation - we will practice kirtan kriya for that clarity so you can take conscious choices in the whirlwind of the world today.

The wide expanse that opened out before the heights on which the Russian batteries stood guarding the bridge, was at times veiled by a diaphanous curtain of slanting rain, and then, suddenly spread out in the sunlight, far-distant objects could be clearly seen glittering as though freshly varnished. Down below, the little town could be seen with its white, red-roofed houses, its cathedral, and its bridge, on both sides of which streamed jostling masses of Russian troops. At the bend of the Danube, vessels, an island, and a castle with a park surrounded by the waters of the confluence of the Enns and the Danube, became visible, and the rocky left bank of the Danube covered with pine forests, with a mystic background of green tree-tops and bluish gorges. The turrets of a convent stood out beyond a wild virgin pine-forest, and far away on the other side of the Enns the enemy\u2019s horse patrols could be discerned.\"\nWar and Peace, Tolstoy.\n\n####\n\nPeace is ambiguous, peace is fleeting, peace is elusive.\nAmidst the chaos, I dared to start this epic (yeah, being highly optimistic, you say), and it's been a while. Things do not move. Planning is pointless, when your plan is not time's plan. So plan all you want but, things remain static. You try your best to find a seclusive moment, and just when you get the time, you realize - its not the chores or the people or the events that are distracting you, its rather you, yourself. No pressure, but that seems to be the crux of it.\n\nLong story short, I wanted to read, but wanted to sketch this beautifully narrated scene. Of course, what came to my mind is different than what I painted, but in either case, this was done. \n\nUsed two of the pigment pens (or whatever these are called), with my son's ink (looks like cobalt blue) and a pinch of burnt sienna, that I decided to include at the last moment.\n\n#peace #monochrome #monologue #tolstoy #warandpeace #danube #blue #burntsienna #2020 #artistsoninstagram #artlovers #lockdowndiaries #monochromestudies","NumberOfLikes":141,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":16,"Timestamp":1595049334,"LocalDate":"Sat Jul 18 07:15:34 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Tag your loved ones in the comment section below.....whom you miss the most in the lockdown😜😊❤️\n..........Follow ✍🏻✍🏻 @navishalla \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#quotesbaper #loveforever #hindipoetry #hindiquote #statusquo #punjabishayri #punjabi #writing #diaryfree #papercut #shayar #shayaries #instaqram #quotesdaily #happyquotes #love #in #the #air #lockdownlife #lockdowndiaries #chandigarh #gurdaspur #punjab #written #blogger #ｔｈｏｕｇｈｔｓ #soch #qoutesoftheday","NumberOfLikes":400,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Navi shalla in Pathankot.

Depression is more than just a low mood \u2013 it's a serious condition that affects your physical and mental health. It is a common illness worldwide, with more than 264 million people affected. It causes people to suffer greatly and function poorly at work, at school and in the family. At its worst, depression can lead to suicide. Close to 800 000 people die due to suicide every year. Suicide is the second leading cause of death in 15-29-year-olds. While we don\u2019t know exactly what causes depression, a number of things are often linked to its development. Depression usually results from a combination of recent events and other longer-term or personal factors, rather than one immediate issue or event.
