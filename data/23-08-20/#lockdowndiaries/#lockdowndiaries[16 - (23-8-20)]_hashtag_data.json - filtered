When it all began, our country wasn\u2019t that effected and much like others, we took that as a comforting factor and hoped that things will be better soon. \n\nToday, the situation has worsened. We feel anxiety everyday at uncertainty of the future. We feel sad at the pathetic state of world affairs. We feel angry at the arrogance of folks who consider themselves invincible. We miss our family and friends. It hurts that despite being in the same city, we cannot meet our loved ones.\n\nIf you\u2019re reading this, we know you too have felt the same or are still feeling it everyday. But you know what, you\u2019re here right now on this platform and so are we. We\u2019re still looking to connect with each other. Despite our emotional struggles, there\u2019s a time in the day when you, us and many others are either creating great content and\/or appreciating each other. We overcome our feelings of anxiety and sadness, and create\/share a lot of positivity. That my friends is what HOPE does to us.\n\nA hope that this time will pass soon. \nA hope that our lives will be better than what\u2019s now and especially what was before.\nA hope that this world will soon be the place it was meant to be - a happy place to live in. \n\nPic: Gili Trawangan, Indonesia\nShot on : Nikon 3500\n#indonesia #thatindiancouple #lockdowndiaries #beautifuldestinations #travelphotography #islandlife #travelbloggers #coupletravels #traveltogether #exploreindonesia #worldtravel #indiantravellers #indiantravelblogger #travelingcouples #beachvibes #islandvibes #indonesiabucketlist #travelgoals #giliislands #travelogue #southeastasia #cntravel #freedom #lovefortravel #travelthroughtheworld #balilife #nikonphotography #photography #travellersofindia","NumberOfLikes":748,"Hashtags":["#indonesia","#thatindiancouple","#lockdowndiaries","#beautifuldestinations","#travelphotography","#islandlife","#travelbloggers","#coupletravels","#traveltogether","#exploreindonesia","#worldtravel","#indiantravellers","#indiantravelblogger","#travelingcouples","#beachvibes","#islandvibes","#indonesiabucketlist","#travelgoals","#giliislands","#travelogue","#southeastasia","#cntravel","#freedom","#lovefortravel","#travelthroughtheworld","#balilife","#nikonphotography","#photography","#travellersofindia"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Tamshuk & Ruzin in Gili Trawangan with @natgeotravel, @cntraveler, @indtravel, @travelandleisure, @beautifuldestinations, @ruzinvakharia, @lonelyplanetindia, @travelandleisureindia, @natgeoyourshot, @nikonindiaofficial, @nikonasia, @delux.e24, @trave.lthe_world, and @nomadtravelcommunity.

When everything around us was - the way we preferred it to be. I had joined a new company, I also moved to a new place. Everything was new and often there were circumstances - absolutely, not in my favour. Amidst the chaos and the uneasiness, that was often accompanied by a tinge of melancholy, I kept my hope alive. I didn't want to dislike the new neighbourhood, I didn't want my new job to be a mess, I didn't want to dislike the new park with no squirrels around.. Days and weeks went by, and then a frequent carpool ride from office to back home in the evenings, led me to make new friends, and of them, I made a special friend. We started hanging out frequently, sharing our stories, pouring our pain, our heartaches and heartbreaks over food.  Sometimes they were dumplings, sometimes a pizza, and sometimes they were garlic noodles, but, often it was coffee and cake at this one place at 100feet road which we both loved. We shared countless stories, heartaches, giggles and laughter together.. Time spent together was precious and often accompanied by some lovely coffee and some good food here. @srinivaspillai I miss our long conversations and good food too... 😊😊 Can't wait for things to return the way they were...Sigh!

I actually recorded this video about two months ago, but couldn\u2019t deal with the editing process as I had other pressing matters to attend to haha! This is not to say this was not important, I just had to rearrange my priorities that\u2019s all 😌. \n\nMain points to take from this recording:\n\nBe comfortable with being uncomfortable. Don\u2019t avoid uncomfortable situations or conversations just to maintain your comfort. It\u2019s only the people who are willing to be uncomfortable that will go far in life. Comfort breeds complacency! \n\nAlways ask questions, even when it seems dumb or unwise! Asking questions (especially the right ones) helps you gain insight and understanding, and when you have that, anything you do you will always do it better, and with confidence because you comprehend the task in hand. Never shy away from being inquisitive.\n\nStop wasting your time chasing field mice, or else you will starve - but rather, have the patience, strength and endurance to hunt after antelope! A lion that feeds on field mice will soon starve to death, but a lion that hunts after antelope provides a feast for itself and the pride. Chase after bigger things and don\u2019t waste your energy and time on insignificant things.\n\nThere is a bonus point in there too, so I\u2019ll let you watch the video to see what the bonus point is 😉.\n\n#ToolsofTitans #TimFerris #BuildingMyselfUp #LockdownDiaries #Reading #FavouriteBooks #SelfEducation #WisdomInBooks #Wisdom #Books #Education #Success #Winning #Library #BookCollection","NumberOfLikes":33,"Hashtags":["#ToolsofTitans","#TimFerris","#BuildingMyselfUp","#LockdownDiaries","#Reading","#FavouriteBooks","#SelfEducation","#WisdomInBooks","#Wisdom","#Books","#Education","#Success","#Winning","#Library","#BookCollection"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1594815025,"LocalDate":"Wed Jul 15 14:10:25 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"For as long as you cultivate the one that is unconditional, the size of the circle doesn't matter. \n\n🌻Sisterhood\/frienships are a human necessity.\n\n#weekendwednesday\n#wednesdaylockdown\n#lockdowndiaries\n#forcedmeditation\n#worthwhile #worthwhilerecharge #recharged #selfcare #humannecessities #friendshipquotes #friendship #selflovecoachinguganda #song #miming #shapeofmyheart","NumberOfLikes":8,"Hashtags":["#weekendwednesday","#wednesdaylockdown","#lockdowndiaries","#forcedmeditation","#worthwhile","#worthwhilerecharge","#recharged","#selfcare","#humannecessities","#friendshipquotes","#friendship","#selflovecoachinguganda","#song","#miming","#shapeofmyheart"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1594814341,"LocalDate":"Wed Jul 15 13:59:01 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Today's Creation \"Schezwan Chutney\" to satisfy\u200B our infinite love for indo-chinese food 😋 though nothing is Chinese in that it's totally desi style 😋😋 if any Chinese is following\u200B my page then definitely they kill me for telling indo-chinese food as Chinese delicacy 😛😛😛 LOL 😜 \n.\n.\nIt's totally chemical \/ food colour \/ msg \/any preservative free Chutney 😋 you don't need to go to check blog b'coz I am sharing recipe over here 🤗🤗 \n.\nSchezwan Chutney ❤️🔥❤️\n.\n1\/2 cup garlic finely chopped\n1\/4 cup ginger finely chopped \n1\/2 steams of coriander\n12 dry red chili (I used Kashmiri)\n1\/2 cup oil\n2 tbsp sugar\nSalt as per taste\n1\/2 cup tomato ketchup \n1\/2 cup water\n2 tsp vinegar\n2 tsp soy sauce\n.\nMethod:- \n🔥 Boil red chili in enough water for 10 mins.

It\u2019s a pair of ghungroo from my school days. I think my parents bought this for me when I was in 5th grade, when it was compulsory for all students to wear ghungroo during our traditional Bharatnatyam and kathak dance classes.  I still remember how excited I was to wear them literally everywhere I would go. I would wear them and run all around my home like a mellifluous hurricane, I would eat food, watch TV, study, even sleep with my ghungroo on.  I was really good at skating and was equally crazy for my new set of assets also. So, one day when Mom was getting me and my brother ready for going skating in a nearby stadium, I was really adamant about doing skating and wearing ghungroo simultaneously. Mom tried to convince me that it might be dangerous and I may end up getting hurt. But I was not a sort of kid to give up.  So, there I was, sporting a ghungroo, in the skating arena, dancing to my own tunes, not caring about alignment and linearity taught in my dance classes, neither skating within those white border lines drawn to confine kids. And in that moment, I , unknowingly created fusion from freedom of my thoughts.  This trait of imagination and innovation is as inherent in a 10 yr old as a 45 yr old. But in this huge bridge gap of 35 yrs, slowly and bit by bit, we are taught to tone down, settle in for subtlety.  The underlying idea behind this post is never to fit in but to stand out; never to be subtle but be a daredevil; never to let the adult in us give up on our 10 yr old selves.  #lostandfound #words #childhoodmemories #writersofinstagram #writing #writingcommunity #yellow #flowers #sunshine #lockdowndiaries #green #poetry #memories #dance #kathak #bharatanatyam #skatergirl #skate #daredevil #innovation #ghungroo #classic #fusion","NumberOfLikes":4,"Hashtags":["#lostandfound","#words","#childhoodmemories","#writersofinstagram","#writing","#writingcommunity","#yellow","#flowers","#sunshine","#lockdowndiaries","#green","#poetry","#memories","#dance","#kathak","#bharatanatyam","#skatergirl","#skate","#daredevil","#innovation","#ghungroo","#classic","#fusion"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Shweta Pandey on July 15, 2020.

Until that point I never thought I could feel so alone and helpless. The first weeks were really tough, particularly because in the UK most people felt safe and were underestimating what was going on in Italy, so I felt really misunderstood. I have been in lockdown alone for almost 4 months now, but my family has tried to be close to me as much as possible.
