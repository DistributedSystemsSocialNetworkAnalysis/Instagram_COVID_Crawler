Everything works out following a particular pattern. And every pattern follows a rhythm. Contrasts look mesmerizing as in unaided sight, don't they? But what we don't discern is the blend of the two contrasts, coexisting in between them, even without their own knowledge. The merge that makes the two contrasts, contrasting. The perfect blend creates a bond - a cosmos. It's there, right there. Yet, we fail to acknowledge its aura. \n\nThe pattern appeals more to us now because of the blend. It won't be long before we clock the transition. In introspect, we shall descry another realm hinged to it. A mead of solace and cheer, where we'd surely run back to, given a choice. It has a rare rhythm that sets our souls onto a pirouette; one that we'll least expect to discover over a dozen moons and cosmic sunsets. \n\nA transition, we hear, is a passing phase. Yet, it's capable of holding the contrasts in perfect harmony. Maybe on the thirteenth moon, the blend would be gone, giving way back to the contrasts. Or maybe, the contrasts would finally realise how they're nothing but spitting images of one another. Standing at the edge, across a burnt bridge, we'll see the setting rays fall directly over our blend of contrasting equals and prohibitions. We'll know where we belong; each owning a key each to our mien. Because we are the contrasts. It's exactly in the blend where we shed our inhibitions, in our little moment of transience, before being transmuted back to contrasts. Keeping up with the delusions on purpose, we love to dwell in the blends, secretly in our own cocooned contrasting commotions. \n\nIt's our pattern to stay in denial.\nWe deny to accept. We fear it's too perfect.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#sunsetlover #skyporn #skylover #dusk #sunsetphotography #photooftheday #artblogger #artoftheday #sunset_ig #instagram #instapic #instalike #instalife #sunset_love #instagram #igdaily #igersdaily #igdailytoday #instagood #instamood #igers #igtravel #igaddict #stayhome #staysafe #quarantine #quarantineandchill #lockdown #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":59,"Hashtags":["#sunsetlover","#skyporn","#skylover","#dusk","#sunsetphotography","#photooftheday","#artblogger","#artoftheday","#sunset_ig","#instagram","#instapic","#instalike","#instalife","#sunset_love","#instagram","#igdaily","#igersdaily","#igdailytoday","#instagood","#instamood","#igers","#igtravel","#igaddict","#stayhome","#staysafe","#quarantine","#quarantineandchill","#lockdown","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Roshni on July 14, 2020.

The idea of such a group is ruled by certain dynamics. One of those is \u201Cheterogeneity\u201D. \n.\nOver the time, I have realised, two homogenous persons may get along well, but whenever, it comes to a group, heterogeneity is one of the key thing that keeps them together. Just like our fingers, everyone can\u2019t be the same, yet everyone is important in their own way. \n.\n.\nAnd, to relive this heterogeneity, trips are important. Short trips, long ones, mountains, seas or any random places..the intention is to stay together. To spend times together, to make moments, to cherish them. That is how, it gets rolling. \u201CBonding gets deeper with time\u201D, probably does not suit for friendship coz here, the bonding gets deeper when one has a heartbreak. The bonding gets deeper during those sub-conscious conversations after getting drunk. The bonding gets deeper after you trust that person holding the steering wheel, hoping he will drive you home safely even after 5pegs. The bonding gets deeper when you are being mocked every now and then for something you love to do, yet that same person celebrates your success. \n.\n.\n.\n.\nSo, folks keep travelling. Be anywhere you want to. We cherish the moments but not the lavishness. We miss the comfort zone even outside our homes with that bunch of people and not the fight we might had during the trip. Be it for a day, be it for a weekend or be it for 10days\u2026travel to live, travel to replenish, travel to rejoice, travel to be together, travel to make the bond stronger.
