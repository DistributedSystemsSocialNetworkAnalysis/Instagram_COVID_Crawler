The clock is ticking, My thoughts are flicking. Thoughts are in a complete mess, Yet,l dream of accomplishing something big in way that is effortless. The curtains are dancing in the air. The wind is quite fast, blowing with some flair. am still on my chair, Writing random with my hair. feel my deepening understanding makes me merry, Though still love watching Tom and Jerry. Life is quite strange and contradictory play.

So whenever we go there though very less🙄 they make it a point to feed us these scrumptious Potato Pomegranate filled buns..\nSo in this time of pandemic when we are craving for street food I thought why not make DABELI from scratch. Although it's a bit time taking to make Pavs and Dabeli masala but it was worth the effort. \nThe family favorite was those homemade crunchy spicy peanuts😊\nOnce all the ingredients are ready, just cut the pao in the middle not fully, apply green chutney, imli chutney, Dabeli filling, layer it with peanuts and sev on the border and pan smear with butter... Ready to serve.

To call it a \u201Cwriter\u2019s block\u201D would be reductive; it is existential crisis, as we know it. In that sense, the lockdown has been a blessing, allowing me to express myself in a different way (for what is art if not a form of expression?). It has also served as a steady reminder, that I am more than the words I speak\/write.

Sharing one such with all of you on this amazing day of photography.\n.\nThis mosque in the photograph, was built in 1835 at Tollygunge by Prince Ghulam Muhammad, the youngest son of Tipu Sultan. However, he built another mosque near Dharmatala road of Kolkata around 1842.

Then horror which we used to read in past came in reality for this generation... Pandemic. \nLockdown was imposed in short interval notice and in a snap sound of fingers, many found themselves jobless, trapped inside. Privileged as me just had to get ourselves keep confined to our spaces. Real struggle was for them whose life started daily with sunrise and bread earned by long day hard work. Now there was no work.\nAs a photographers' perspective, shoots got cancelled, project delayed or denied. After a few days of not shooting, we started searching way to pursue passion. Business meetings started on conference video calls. Few photographers came with a temporary solution of shooting on video calls. Facetime shoots, WhatsApp Call shoots, Google video shoots, Skype shoot came in existence... in a shell, Virtual Shoots. Ofcourse not good as actual shoot, but \"...dil ko khush rakhne ko ghalib ye khayal achchha hai...\", it became a trend amongst photographers.\nAfter initial denial, me too thought to give it a try. Talked to few people connected with me. Now I am sharing few results. \nI won't call myself as Photographer for these shots, just a director. \n--- \u2022\u2022\u2022 ---\nIn picture: @itsharshitaagarwal\n--- \u2022\u2022\u2022 ---\n#virtual #shoot #virtualshoot #facetime #facetimephotoshoot #whatsapp #videocall #portrait_vision #pictureoftheday #photooftheday #pursuitofportraits #portrait_today #portrait_mood #portraitphotography #portrait_shots #portraiture #mood #moodygrams #snapseed #lockdowndiaries #lockdown #coronatime #portraitvision_ #pr0ject_uno #pr0ject_soul #portraitphotographer #bluedenim #relaxing #denim #relax","NumberOfLikes":37,"Hashtags":["#virtual","#shoot","#virtualshoot","#facetime","#facetimephotoshoot","#whatsapp","#videocall","#portrait_vision","#pictureoftheday","#photooftheday","#pursuitofportraits","#portrait_today","#portrait_mood","#portraitphotography","#portrait_shots","#portraiture","#mood","#moodygrams","#snapseed","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdown","#coronatime","#portraitvision_","#pr0ject_uno","#pr0ject_soul","#portraitphotographer","#bluedenim","#relaxing","#denim","#relax"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597763368,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 18 17:09:28 CEST 2020","Location":"India"},{"Owner":"the_procrastinator_hijabee","CaptionText":"Read so many books at the start of lockdown , watched so many series, did alot of DIYS, andddd much more now I'm just like I don't want to do ANYTHING!!!!!

Actually a 12 :) (As I do my best Carole King Tapestry pose)\n\nI\u2019ve learnt something pretty big about myself during lockdown and I don\u2019t know if you guys can relate. I\u2019ve learnt that I need to set boundaries and say no more often. As a self-proclaimed recluse I love time alone to be in my own zone or with people who inspire me and stir my soul, working on projects towards exciting goals. But so often, my people-pleasing side takes over and I end up extending far too much energy on draining obligations and doing things I don\u2019t want to do. It\u2019s like life was just \u2018getting through\u2019 one thing or another before I could get some peace! When lockdown started, the idea of having a clear calendar for a little while actually filled me with me such a sense of relief that it really threw me back. Did society really take that great a toll on my well-being? Am I that fragile or anti-social a person? But it was great because I was able to communicate with the people in my life I really wanted to communicate with and work on things I wanted to work on without huge amounts of distraction (except for a tiny child). The thought of re-entering society after this lovely house bound sojourn actually filled me with dread. And I do know that many people still had to carry on as usual or really suffered or had to step up to the plate and be super heroes during this time so I don\u2019t want to make light of the situation. But I think we\u2019ve all learnt a little bit about ourselves. Now that lockdown measures are being lifted, I am going to start either finding a way to see the joy in everything I do (even if I don\u2019t want to do it!) or getting the guts to say no to things I don\u2019t want. That way, hopefully, the things I do want can find their way into my life and I can live in the most authentic way possible. #stoicmindset #zenhabits #peoplepleaser #peoplepleasing #lockdowndiaries #lockdownthoughts","NumberOfLikes":27,"Hashtags":["#stoicmindset","#zenhabits","#peoplepleaser","#peoplepleasing","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdownthoughts"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Pia Varma on August 18, 2020.

I usually start while I\u2019m preparing breakfast. Our everyday bread for the children is a very simple white loaf that I make in my KitchenAid. This is a recipe I\u2019ve been using on and off for 13 years, and is adapted from \u2018The Cook\u2019s Companion\u2019 by Stephanie Alexander. \n\nI use 1kg bread flour, 2 tbsp olive oil, 1 tbsp dry yeast, 1tsp salt and 600ml warm water. Throw it all into the bowl of the mixer and knead with the dough hook for ten minutes. Move the dough to a large oiled bowl, cover with a tea towel, and leave to rise for about an hour. Knock the dough back, divide in half and place in two oiled bread tins to rise another 30-45 mins. Bake at 220c for 25 mins. You can remove the loaves from the tins for the last five minutes of baking for a crunchier crust.\n\nI\u2019ve made this recipe using 20% wholemeal flour and 100% wholemeal and they both work well. If you want to use 100% wholemeal you may need to bake a little longer. \n\nI make pizza dough once a week for lunches, and once or twice a week I may also make buns or another bread. This morning I tried this Milk Bun recipe from @locallovely \u2018s \u2018A Basket by the Door\u2019. (This is an amazing cookbook by the way, one of my favourites!)\n\nNeither my husband or I can actually eat any of these breads I regularly bake. I\u2019m hoping to begin experimenting with gluten-free sourdough soon, but for now I make a GF cornbread every few weeks and Evan snacks on that. \n\nThe best bread that you can eat, health wise, is a long-fermented sourdough loaf. I have had seasons of regularly baking sourdough, but I\u2019ve had to accept that in my current season I can\u2019t keep a starter alive. These simple yeast breads fit into my daily routine, only require about ten minutes of hands-on preparation time, and are still a much better choice nutritionally than store bought loaves. (I\u2019d rather not feed my kids soy flour, vegetable oils and questionable additives, thanks!)\n\nLet me know your favourite bread to bake, and also if you\u2019d like more posts like this, sharing some of the details of how we feed a large family. ☺️","NumberOfLikes":101,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":21,"Timestamp":1597714249,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 18 03:30:49 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"isipanini","CaptionText":"Saw my dad bringing home a bag of @made.manumano , took a bite, took a shot, ganda ng araw e!

Although there are several types of diets, what works best for me is the intermittent fasting. I have been following IF for as long as I can remember. I\u2019ve tried everything. Rujuta divekar to keto! Name it and I\u2019ve done it but for me most sustainable has been IF. Following are the things that have worked for me. \n- 16 to 18 hours fast and 6 hours eating window. \n- I start eating anywhere bet 1pm to 3pm (first meal of the day) and stop  eating at 9pm\n- During the eating window I eat everything... carbs, protiens, fats everything. \n- Generally avoid sweets and fried stuff. And honestly I don\u2019t really crave it either. Not a junk eater nor do I have a sweet tooth🤞🏽\n- For dinner though I try to cut down on carbs. So if i want to eat roti\/rice it\u2019s usually included in lunch. \n- My alcohol intake has gone down n how due to zero socialising. So may be have a drink once in 10\/15 days and that has probably helped too. \n- I\u2019ve been trying to cut down on my thumbs up though 🙈 I\u2019ve been partly successful but haven\u2019t been able to kick it out completely 🙈 Aerated drinks is worst for the body n we all kno that !! \n- I believe one of the biggest reasons I\u2019ve been able to lose is not eating outside at all. No late night parties. No midnight snacks. No nothing! I\u2019ve literally ordered from out like twice in the past 6 months. Period.

I tend to fall really hard for them. I have nothing short of a romantic fling with London. 12 years on, I am still smitten. It keeps me shelling out eye watering rent, exploring cafes with the giddy excitement of a teenager on a first date and weeping when @dominiqueansellondon decides to close its pretty doors. \n\u2063\nI have moved a fair number of times within the UK. 3 years in Glasgow, 4 years in London, 3.5 years in Southampton and now nearly 1 year back in the capital. My love for London remains intact.\n\u2063\nWhy do I love London so much? For starters, the 2000-year-old history charms my socks off. Its endured quite a lot in that time. The influenza pandemic. The Blitz. Financial meltdowns, as recent as 2008. And now the novel coronavirus.\n\u2063\nBritain officially entered recession last week and things are unravelling quickly. Jobs are being lost as furlough scheme is winding down. Every time I go doomscrolling, another business shuts down. While landlords and homeowners have been cut some financial slack, renters like me have been left to fend for themselves. I genuinely fear for our jobs. I feel like I am sitting on top of a precarious precipice that I can tumble off any second. But, in what some may call my foolish ways, this lack of stability has added fuel to my \u2018live for today\u2019 attitude. I am even more adamant to make the most of here and now. I feel like I took everything in life for granted, even the luxury of dealing with setbacks or curve balls without a pandemic suspended in the background. Clearly things can always get worse so I might as well enjoy when I can.\n\u2063\nThere are SO MANY UNCERTAINTIES floating in the horizon that I cannot even begin to address them. I have huge dips in my mood and genuine childish inner tantrums wondering KENO COVID HOILO. Working out, reading more, and brunching with my boys after 4 months really, really helps. \n\u2063\nI feel extremely privileged to be able to go out and do normal things because I know many people are not able to do so. I am always mindful of that. But I also allow myself to give in to feeling good without thinking much else. At this point in time, it\u2019s become a survival tool.","NumberOfLikes":498,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Samira Ahmed in London, United Kingdom.

I come from a big, close family - and being away from them was really difficult. \n\nI remember one time, I was walking through a shopping centre outside London, and suddenly I felt a wave of uncontrollable emotion rush over me. I stood in the middle of the walkway, and cried. It was unexpected (and let\u2019s face it, a little awkward), but I couldn\u2019t control it. I missed home.\n\nI may be at home now, but I\u2019ve felt those waves a lot lately. Because a home isn\u2019t just about the four walls and roof over our heads. A home isn\u2019t just about the scenery we take for granted every day as we go about our lives. A home isn\u2019t just about the things that make it a place to feel secure and safe. \n\nHome, for me, is about people. The people who make my little place in the world feel content, warm and comforting. Like home. \n\nMy Mum\u2019s cooking that instantly injects me with love and my Dad\u2019s ridiculous jokes that have us rolling our eyes and laughing simultaneously. That feels like home. \nMy little brothers and sisters, our dynamic and our banter\u2026 that\u2019s home.\nSeeing my beautiful friends, and drinking bubbles, talking our heads off, practicing impossible TikTok dances, and dancing on tables as we laugh all night\u2026. that\u2019s home. \nWaking up before the sun each day, jumping in the car to the gym and moving my body with people who uplift and inspire me\u2026 that\u2019s home. \nSeeing my children play with their friends, and run through our house laughing and playing with their little buddies\u2026 that\u2019s home. \nPopping across or down the road to my neighbours\u2019 house for a quick cup of tea and a chat (or a cheeky Friday champagne)\u2026 that\u2019s home. \nSeeing my nieces and nephews, and the children of my beautiful friends grow up and play with my kids... that\u2019s home. \nWalking through our village on a Sunday when the Farmer\u2019s Market is on - buying local produce and seeing cafes so busy their customers are spilling out on the streets as they happily waiting for their coffee in the sunshine\u2026. that\u2019s home. \n\n(Continued in comments)....","NumberOfLikes":62,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":40,"Timestamp":1597658938,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 12:08:58 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"nurifakier","CaptionText":"Monday morning project...\n#pantry\n#CapeTown \n#lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":10,"Hashtags":["#pantry","#CapeTown","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1597658853,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 12:07:33 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"lifewithobjects","CaptionText":"Brad Ascalon Studio's approach to furniture and product design has always been about reducing an object to the essential, to only that which is necessary to benefit that object\u2019s function and its manufacturability, while assuring that the aesthetics are driven by those tenets first and foremost.
