Jorrel loves it while out an about with the kids if he gets messages or phone calls he doesn\u2019t need to rummage around for his phone he can use his watch to keep track of them. Due to him starting his exercise regime again he is loving the fact the fitness tracker also has a stopwatch so no more having to have his phone with him, it also keeps track of his heart rate and how many calories he has burnt. \nTonight he is going to try the sleep tracker for the first time. This will tell him how many hours he\u2019s slept how many hours he\u2019s been awake for and also how deep or how restless his sleep pattern is.

Majorly sat on my designated sofa,browsed internet ,did my calorie count, and nothing.\nYesterday,the weather was beautiful, there was a little drizzle. But I have understood one thing, one has to stay and adopt the environment they are in. I had this thought while i was cutting tomatoes on my kitchen table. Tomatoes were deep red,i had cut them in squares, on the stove there was a pan,in which chopped onions were frying in adequate amount of oil,it was producing a little sizzling sound. Then I looked outside the window, right outside my kitchen window is a rose plant in its full blossom, red roses everywhere,on it. My sight then got hold of my father who was doing something in his car probably cleaning, he had some melody playing in the car.\nI looked down and started chopping some green chillies for the pilaf ,I was making. It made a beautiful color trajectory, red roses, green chillies, blue bangles am wearing,some music playing in the background. It was all so soothing and so beautiful. This is what I crave the most,when I am out there fighting my battles. This is peace. This is home.

Now start adding milk while swiftly whisking the batter. Ensure to add milk gradually and not at one go. Once a thick creamy consistency is formed, keep the batter aside. Now grease the baking tin with butter or refined oil. Before pouring the batter into tin, add ENO to the mix and gently mix it using cut and fold method. Make sure to not over whisk the batter post adding ENO. And now immediately pour the batter in tin.\nPut the tin in microwave and set the timer for 5 mins. Take out the tin and your nice fluffy sponge is ready. Keep the sponge to cool down.\n\nP.S. I decorated the cake since it was a friend's birthday. You can have the simply baked cake sponge with coffee or tea. It will taste awesome! \nFor layering and decoration: \nBefore layering the sponges, I have sprayed them with sugar syrup to make it little moist. While layering, I used the chocolate syrup. It helps the sponge to stick together and gives a good flavour as well. For decoration, I have randomly arrange Oreo original biscuits and chocolate pieces over condensed milk which I poured on the top most sponge. On the sides I have arranged choco waffle rolls.

Elegant yet simple, it is swift, light and fluffy. It embodies all the nuances of the autumn perfume - ginger, cinnamon and caramel, blurring the absence of coffee.\n.\nEmbellished with their flecks of spices and sparkles of sugar peeking through the velvety cream, the crushed cookies is flamboyantly charismatic.\n.\nUsing crushed lotus biscoff biscuits, provides a toothsome contrast to the usual boudoir lady fingers. The taste is opulent and rich yet it is not as heavy as most desserts, quietly mollifying after a plump Sunday lunch. You can either serve it from a large bowl or prepare individual servings in pretty glasses or bowls.\n.\nThe link to this recipe can be found in the profile. \n\nTo shop my ebook, head over to the link in bio.\n.\nFollow @foodiesof_cakewalk for more photos and ideas\/recipes.

Then horror which we used to read in past came in reality for this generation... Pandemic. \nLockdown was imposed in short interval notice and in a snap sound of fingers, many found themselves jobless, trapped inside. Privileged as me just had to get ourselves keep confined to our spaces. Real struggle was for them whose life started daily with sunrise and bread earned by long day hard work. Now there was no work.\nAs a photographers' perspective, shoots got cancelled, project delayed or denied. After a few days of not shooting, we started searching way to pursue passion. Business meetings started on conference video calls. Few photographers came with a temporary solution of shooting on video calls. Facetime shoots, WhatsApp Call shoots, Google video shoots, Skype shoot came in existence... in a shell, Virtual Shoots. Ofcourse not good as actual shoot, but \"...dil ko khush rakhne ko ghalib ye khayal achchha hai...\", it became a trend amongst photographers.\nAfter initial denial, me too thought to give it a try. Talked to few people connected with me. Now I am sharing few results. \nI won't call myself as Photographer for these shots, just a director. \n--- \u2022\u2022\u2022 ---\nIn picture: @dikshadesire\n--- \u2022\u2022\u2022 ---\n#virtual #shoot #virtualshoot #facetime #facetimephotoshoot #whatsapp #videocall #portrait_vision #pictureoftheday #photooftheday #pursuitofportraits #portrait_today #portrait_mood #portraitphotography #portrait_shots #portraiture #mood #moodygrams #snapseed #lockdowndiaries #lockdown #coronatime #portraitvision_ #pr0ject_uno #pr0ject_soul #portraitphotographer #couch #red #faceshot #expression","NumberOfLikes":37,"Hashtags":["#virtual","#shoot","#virtualshoot","#facetime","#facetimephotoshoot","#whatsapp","#videocall","#portrait_vision","#pictureoftheday","#photooftheday","#pursuitofportraits","#portrait_today","#portrait_mood","#portraitphotography","#portrait_shots","#portraiture","#mood","#moodygrams","#snapseed","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdown","#coronatime","#portraitvision_","#pr0ject_uno","#pr0ject_soul","#portraitphotographer","#couch","#red","#faceshot","#expression"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597505708,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 17:35:08 CEST 2020","Location":"India"},{"CaptionText":"Cup of Joe🤎☕\n\n#coffeelover #coffeeaddict #barristalife #espressolove  #caffeinedaily #coffeefirst #coffeeoclock #elixir is #coffeequotes #coffeesesh #coffeemania #coffeemaniac #coffeeeveryday #lockdowndiaries  #coffeeaddict  #caffeineaddict #caffeinated  #coffeesesh #cofeelovers #coffeewoman #capuchino","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#coffeelover","#coffeeaddict","#barristalife","#espressolove","#caffeinedaily","#coffeefirst","#coffeeoclock","#elixir","#coffeequotes","#coffeesesh","#coffeemania","#coffeemaniac","#coffeeeveryday","#lockdowndiaries","#coffeeaddict","#caffeineaddict","#caffeinated","#coffeesesh","#cofeelovers","#coffeewoman","#capuchino"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by bronzed_affair on August 15, 2020.

I have been writing and rewriting the review since then. I couldn't find the right words to express how much I loved this book. I still can't. But not posting about this book seems unfair. \n\nThis is the story of a black man charged with the rape of a white girl. This is the story of the best dad - Atticus Finch. This is the story of three little gems - Scout, Jem and Dill.\n\nWhat I liked best is that the story is narrated through the innocent eyes of a little girl called Scout. It shows us that a 9-year-old kid can understand that judging a person by his colour is not fair. However, adults find it very hard to treat people in a fair manner. At times they don't even realise what they are doing is wrong. \n\nThis book was written in 1960, but it has still not lost its relevance. The recent murder of George Floyd reminds us that we haven't learnt much despite addressing the issue for several decades. \n\nI bought this book a few years back. I couldn't get past the first few pages all those years. But, this time I finished it and I am so glad I did. \nIt is my recent favourite. 😍\n\nHappy reading❤️❤️❤️\n\n(Can anybody guess my current read based on the book cover you see in the picture?.)\n\n#writerscommunity #writers_den_ #atticusfinch #harperlee #bookstagram #booklover #blacklivesmatter #racism #prejudice #loveofwords #tokillamockingbird #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":34,"Hashtags":["#writerscommunity","#writers_den_","#atticusfinch","#harperlee","#bookstagram","#booklover","#blacklivesmatter","#racism","#prejudice","#loveofwords","#tokillamockingbird","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Unnimaya cm on August 14, 2020.","NumberOfComments":11,"Timestamp":1597419035,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 14 17:30:35 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#lockdowndiaries #happymemorialday #withlove❤️ ⅞","NumberOfLikes":33,"Hashtags":["#lockdowndiaries","#happymemorialday","#withlove❤️"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by 🚭 ↕️sAK ®️eDDy 🚭 on August 14, 2020.

The Mole sauce was sweet, tangy and o so gloriously spicy - with a subtle hint of the hard chocolate. But our favourite had to be the Pollo de fuego with the soft shell tacos - the charred bit of chicken with sauted bellpeppers is absolutely addictive.
