That's roughly how long many of us were in lockdown and some are in lockdown again ❤️. Spending a lot of time at home made me feel isolated and bored. So, I ate a lot of sugary things and would have a few drinks every evening, which helped me feel better and cope with the stress. These little habits suddenly became something normal and I also put on weight. I have now reduced my sugar intake and when I crave something I portion it. When I want to have an alcoholic beverage, I look for the alcohol free option. In this way I still have alcohol, but a lot less than before. I now enjoy alcohol free beer and found even an alcohol free gin! I have also started drinking more water, which also helps with my well being.

Am I still allowed to refer to these beans as \u2018Kenya\u2019 beans considering I\u2019ve grown them in the UK 🤔? I think I always will.\u2060\n\u2060\nServes 2\u2060\n\u2060\nIngredients\u2060\n300g yellow courgettes, thickly sliced\u2060\n180g green beans, topped & tailed\u2060\n3 cloves smoked garlic, 2 minced, 1 sliced (by @garlic_farm)\u2060\n1 tsp paprika\u2060\n6 tbsp ricotta cheese\u2060\nMint leaves 🍃, chopped\u2060\nMixed salad leaves 🍃 \u2060\nWalnuts, lightly toasted\u2060\nCold pressed rapeseed oil (by @hillfarmoils)\u2060\nCelery salt \u2060\nSalt & pepper\u2060\nDrizzle olive oil\u2060\nMicro coriander (by @mini.herbs)\u2060\n\u2060\n\u2060\nMethod\u2060\n1. Divide some salad leaves between your plates. Set aside.\u2060\n2. In a small bowl, mix together the ricotta, mint leaves and celery salt. Set aside.\u2060\n3. Place a griddle pan over a medium-high heat. When hot, place the courgette slices in the pan and cook for about 4 minutes or until they show some char lines on the courgettes. Flip the slices over and cook until the other side has charred as well. Season and set aside on a warm plate. \u2060\n4. Drizzle a little oil into the pan ⚠️ Be careful as it will still be quite hot ⚠️ Throw in the smoked garlic and the green beans, sprinkle over the paprika powder and cook on a medium heat for about 4-5 mins until cooked. They should still have a slight bite to them.\u2060\n5. Off the heat, throw the courgettes back into the pan and toss together with the green beans. Divide between the two plates and top with dollops of ricotta, toasted walnuts, drizzle over some oil & finally top with that clean and bold flavoured micro coriander. Drizzle over with some olive oil to finish. \u2060\n\u2060\nThe smoked garlic was such a punchy flavour, it complimented the smooth, creamy and fresh ricotta beautifully.

After years of living with Fibromyalgia, which is living with pain and fatigue, I had a realisation - for three years I've worked to \u2019get rid of the pain\u2019. When I sat with the pain, I only focused on the hate, blame and judgement and all the things it took away from me. I never welcomed it, I never listened to it and I never respected it.\n.\nCOVID has forced me into new realms of solitude and reflection, as it has for many of us. And through Dreamwork, working with a Cognitive Psychologist and an amazing Pranic Healer (@valentina_healing) - I started accepting,  listening and finally loving my pain, fatigue and Fibromyalgia. \n.\nNot judging negative emotions and making them \u2018bad\u2019 has really helped me as a tactic to frame COVID. \n.\nMy question for you: Have you made COVID or any emotions you maybe feeling \u2018bad, wrong, judged it or saw it or yourself as less than imperfectly perfect?\u2019\n.\nAre you willing to sit with whatever you maybe feeling or COVID as an experience and let go of the judgment or blame and see it through neutral eyes to listen to what message and gift it brings to you? \n.\nJust a thought - looking forward to hearing you\u2019re reflections on emotions 💕\n\n#mindfulness #meditation #mindfulnessmeditation #mindfulnesspractice #meditationpractice #meditations #meditationchallenge #wellbeing #wellbeingwarrior #wellbeingjourney #wellnesscoach #makingthebestofit #lockdown #lockdown2020 #lockdownlife #lockdowndiaries #lightworker #loveyourself #creativity #creative #quotestoliveby #creativewriting #Creativelifehappylife #creativityeveryday #creativitycoach #creativitymatters","NumberOfLikes":28,"Hashtags":["#2,","#mindfulness","#meditation","#mindfulnessmeditation","#mindfulnesspractice","#meditationpractice","#meditations","#meditationchallenge","#wellbeing","#wellbeingwarrior","#wellbeingjourney","#wellnesscoach","#makingthebestofit","#lockdown","#lockdown2020","#lockdownlife","#lockdowndiaries","#lightworker","#loveyourself","#creativity","#creative","#quotestoliveby","#creativewriting","#Creativelifehappylife","#creativityeveryday","#creativitycoach","#creativitymatters"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Penelope Jane Jones in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia with @valentina_healing.

It was closed to all visitors until 1992 which makes it one of the most preserved regions in the world!!! It is often considered as more Tibetan than controlled by China Tibet. The isolation from the outside world has helped to preserve unique Tibetan culture.\nThis picture has been taken in the village of Tiri, which is located 1 hr hike from Kagbeni on Annapurna Circuit trek. This is how close you can get to Upper Mustang without paying a hefty permit fee which foreigners need to pay to enter this stunning region.\nUpper Mustang is the only trek in Nepal that can be easily done in August (rainy season) as it\u2019s such an arid and remote region that even monsoon rains do not get here. It's also been high on my bucket list\u2026 So if Japan remains closed and if Nepal opens for trekking, I think I know what I am doing.😎 Hiding in one of the most remote places in the world until this pandemic madness is finished sounds like the right thing to do.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#annapurnacircuit #annapurnacircuittrek #kagbeni #uppermustang #uppermustangtrek #mustangnepal #nepal #strandedinnepal #explorenepal #nepal8thwonder #visitnepal #tibetanculture #tibet #wgórachjestwszystkocokocham #amolamontagna #solotrek #trekking #trekkinggirl #girllovestravel #exploreunexplored #desertlike #podróże #góry #mountaingirl #blogipodroznicze #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":63,"Hashtags":["#annapurnacircuit","#annapurnacircuittrek","#kagbeni","#uppermustang","#uppermustangtrek","#mustangnepal","#nepal","#strandedinnepal","#explorenepal","#nepal8thwonder","#visitnepal","#tibetanculture","#tibet","#wgórachjestwszystkocokocham","#amolamontagna","#solotrek","#trekking","#trekkinggirl","#girllovestravel","#exploreunexplored","#desertlike","#podróże","#góry","#mountaingirl","#blogipodroznicze","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Beata (Beti) Giedziun in Kagbeni, Mustang Nepal.

If we self analyse, we can find that somewhere we are losing ourselves in desperation of being on top. For some time, try to stay where you are and and look for your own self. Serenity leads to piousness and positivity around you. It's also about your own happy place. Finding happiness in every little things is the biggest gamble. I am saying this because nowdays people gamble there happiness for the sake of getting more and more. Try to embrace your positive aura so that those  people who are with you can feel the same.\n\nWell talking about myself, this is the one thing I always try to maintain.

Then horror which we used to read in past came in reality for this generation... Pandemic. \nLockdown was imposed in short interval notice and in a snap sound of fingers, many found themselves jobless, trapped inside. Privileged as me just had to get ourselves keep confined to our spaces. Real struggle was for them whose life started daily with sunrise and bread earned by long day hard work. Now there was no work.\nAs a photographers' perspective, shoots got cancelled, project delayed or denied. After a few days of not shooting, we started searching way to pursue passion. Business meetings started on conference video calls. Few photographers came with a temporary solution of shooting on video calls. Facetime shoots, WhatsApp Call shoots, Google video shoots, Skype shoot came in existence... in a shell, Virtual Shoots. Ofcourse not good as actual shoot, but \"...dil ko khush rakhne ko ghalib ye khayal achchha hai...\", it became a trend amongst photographers.\nAfter initial denial, me too thought to give it a try. Talked to few people connected with me. Now I am sharing few results. \nI won't call myself as Photographer for these shots, just a director. \n--- \u2022\u2022\u2022 ---\nIn picture: @itsharshitaagarwal\n--- \u2022\u2022\u2022 ---\n#virtual #shoot #virtualshoot #facetime #facetimephotoshoot #whatsapp #videocall #portrait_vision #pictureoftheday #photooftheday #pursuitofportraits #portrait_today #portrait_mood #portraitphotography #portrait_shots #portraiture #mood #moodygrams #snapseed #lockdowndiaries #lockdown #coronatime #portraitvision_ #pr0ject_uno #pr0ject_soul #portraitphotographer #bluedenim #blueandwhite #denim #model","NumberOfLikes":50,"Hashtags":["#virtual","#shoot","#virtualshoot","#facetime","#facetimephotoshoot","#whatsapp","#videocall","#portrait_vision","#pictureoftheday","#photooftheday","#pursuitofportraits","#portrait_today","#portrait_mood","#portraitphotography","#portrait_shots","#portraiture","#mood","#moodygrams","#snapseed","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdown","#coronatime","#portraitvision_","#pr0ject_uno","#pr0ject_soul","#portraitphotographer","#bluedenim","#blueandwhite","#denim","#model"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1597241203,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 12 16:06:43 CEST 2020","Location":"New Delhi"},{"CaptionText":"12th entry of What do you meme \nLike your favourite meme and let the person win🥳\n\n#unlockcreativity #instagramchallenge\n#innovation #createnew #challengeyourself #competitioncheer #creativityfest #showyourbest #revealyourtalent #fun #creativity #participateandwin #lockdowndiaries #talentedyouth #memes #createyourmeme #createnew #showyourcreativeside","NumberOfLikes":33,"Hashtags":["#unlockcreativity","#instagramchallenge","#innovation","#createnew","#challengeyourself","#competitioncheer","#creativityfest","#showyourbest","#revealyourtalent","#fun","#creativity","#participateandwin","#lockdowndiaries","#talentedyouth","#memes","#createyourmeme","#createnew","#showyourcreativeside"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Advance HealthCare Foundation on August 12, 2020.

Yes,that's true to some extent but today I am going to point out some positive sides of this lockdown. Firstly, we can spend time with our families and loved ones. Secondly,although we regret that we can't eat street foods and order from restaurants, we are trying to learn cooking and  cook delicious meals for ourselves and our family. Then in this drudgery of life, our hobbies are always neglected by the busy schedule we always have to follow. Now,we can relive our hobbies and watch our favourite shows. \n\nNow, we also understand the importance of little things in our lives which we had almost taken for granted. People working in the corporate sector now have some relief too. Students don't have to wake up early in the morning to rush for schools and colleges. Road accidents have reduced too. Though there are some blood boiling rape cases,still girls are a little safe from eve teasing. Let us all count the blessings instead of grumbling constantly. \n\nLike 👍🏻 if you agree.

When I was around three or four years old, I was awestruck by this mud curving of a small blue-skinned baby, smeared with Makhan all over the body. I didn\u2019t know who he was, so I asked my grandparents. My grandmother narrated the story to me and I felt an attachment with the blue baby then and there. It grew stronger over the years and I always felt that I have an invisible friend in the form of Krishna to guide me.\n.\nJanmashtami for me, and for many others, is a celebration with friends and family and there\u2019s no Janmashtami without a sumptuous lunch spread, after all its his birthday. This year due to obvious reasons I couldn\u2019t invite anyone to celebrate Krishna\u2019s birthday with me. Nonetheless, we celebrated in our own little way..\n.\n#krishna #krishnamurti #krishnalove #krishnakrishna #lordkrishna #giridhari #gopala #krishnamurari #govind #janmashtami #janmashtami2020 #janmashtamispecial #lockdownjanmashtami #lockdowndiaries #foodzpah #riniscookingrhapsody","NumberOfLikes":49,"Hashtags":["#krishna","#krishnamurti","#krishnalove","#krishnakrishna","#lordkrishna","#giridhari","#gopala","#krishnamurari","#govind","#janmashtami","#janmashtami2020","#janmashtamispecial","#lockdownjanmashtami","#lockdowndiaries","#foodzpah","#riniscookingrhapsody"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":8,"Timestamp":1597155716,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 11 16:21:56 CEST 2020","Location":"Knightsbridge Apartments"},{"CaptionText":"☀️It\u2019s a warm one today!
