If you leave the apple slices in the lemon water for longer (like I did by mistake) some of the red comes off the apple peel and turns the apple flesh pink! 🌷\n2. On the end that you start to roll the apple rose, try not to leave any pastry as it will stick out in the middle of the flower. But leave about 1 finger space pastry at the other end of the roll so you can stick it to the side of the rose to complete the flower! \n\nFun fact 🎁\nMother's day was first introduced to Thailand on August 15, 1950.

It was on top of the game, finding ways to make the transition to online learning as smooth as possible. Parents, teachers & even students reached out to support one another with empathy.\nWhile being grateful for my privileges, I was not blind to what the rest of the country was facing. The surrounding hopelessness & misery was heart-wrenching. In this environment, I was grateful to be safe and secure at home. Out of this gratitude came the need to start living in the moment and enjoy doing little things. I started doing things I had put off for years. My whole professional life as a dance practitioner has been ridden with self-doubt and anxiety. I would think about doing things rather than risking doing them and having to face judgment and rejection, except on a few occasions. \nWhile I have overcome some of these fears in my lifetime, this lockdown however unleashed the artiste in me! I was on a roll; making videos, started an FB page, a secret blog for just my peace of mind, at my own pace with no desire to make it reach people!  I put my bathroom singing out in public, something I had never ever imagined I would do! I had the luxury to do little inconsequential things, as my income was secure. I am deeply saddened by the cost the world has had to pay during this lockdown, but it has been a period of growth for me. I am horrified at the thought of a fully technology-driven world, but I have personally reaped its\u2019 benefits.\n\n@mehneer  is a Performing Artist, Choreographer & Educator specializing in Contemporary & Jazz Dance. A founder member of Gati Dance Forum Delhi, she has presented her work at different festivals & taught at dance academies and schools in Delhi, Mumbai, UK, & Cambodia.

The pandemic has shifted my perspective on my life immensely and now I am finally able to look at everything under a different light.

This came to mind as yesterday I was turned away from an UWS restaurant 4 blocks from my home. I've learned the hard way to consider safety when traveling, especially in the south. I'll never forget being nearly hate-crimed at a gas stop in West Virginia and didn't think much of my brother bringing a white companion on each of his cross-country road trips for safety. \n\nScotland 2017 was my first time in Europe; EVERY SINGLE person I spoke with about 'traveling while brown' in Europe had a story. \n- The Spanish call Central American travelers \"tercero-mundiales\" (3rd worlders)\n- Greece came up the most in anecdotal negative experiences...\n\nBasically I had low expectations, I've been treated like shit in Manhattan all the time, but low and below in Scotland I had zero experiences of micro-aggressions aka low-key racism, nor scary encounters with armed white men (this has happened to me in upstate NY, WV and Wisconsin). \n\nIt may seem super basic but it was so unusual to be treated kindly everywhere we went that we fell in love with the Scottish highlands.

This summer was like no other so I have to admit some days I was waking up in the afternoons and I was staying awake the whole night. I tried to be at least somewhat productive by ordering the house or while I still had exams I mainly studied... a lot! But other then that I had the feeling that is all one big, long, never ending day since April till now! \nBut in September I\u2019m staring my placement year, I\u2019m so exited for it and for life to feel normal again!  Wish me luck🤞🏻✨\n\n#bookstaram #bookstagramcommunity #books #book #quotentine #corona #lockdown #lockdown2020 #lockdownlife #lockdowndiaries #lockdownboredom #lockdownbooks #lockdownreads #quarantine #questions #morningroutine","NumberOfLikes":101,"Hashtags":["#bookstaram","#bookstagramcommunity","#books","#book","#quotentine","#corona","#lockdown","#lockdown2020","#lockdownlife","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdownboredom","#lockdownbooks","#lockdownreads","#quarantine","#questions","#morningroutine"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The Traveling Books on August 09, 2020.

I came across her Instagram profile a few weeks ago and I loved the way she danced and in the process presented her body. I messaged her asking if she would be interested in doing a collaborative virtual choreography with me. She agreed and as time progressed, I eventually got to know that she has danced extensively with @sonali.bhadauria and @svetanakanwar , which was very intimidating. \n\nHowever, Asha didi\u2019s sweet nature kept me going and it was a fun process. Even while wearing several hats of being a mom, managing work and home life, it is amazing to see how Asha didi manages to keep dancing as her top priority. In the past few days, she taught me patience and how to work with it. She helped me with my dance process. \n\nHere is to another collab, of this very catchy and breezy song.

Few days before the lockdown we heard that the corona situation is getting worse so, my roommate and I decided to go to our hometown. He decides to leave early, and I had the reservation for 22nd. On the 15th of March, my roommate came from office, at seven in the evening, and he was leaving for his hometown at 9 p.m. on the same day. \nWhile leaving the place he randomly asked me,\"bro why don't you come with me, we'll be back in just 2 days.\" I didn't know Covid19 will turn out to be something bigger, so I thought why not! And I decided to go with him carrying just a backpack with just 3 pairs of clothes. I booked a general ticket and we left for Rajasthan. It was insane travelling in a train carrying one confirm ticket. But somehow we reached his hometown. \nOn the same morning everywhere in the news, they were showing news related to Corona Virus and much stuff related to it. Everyone was worried and confused about the situation. Soon many places started to shut down. I too got little scared, so I decided to go back to home but not sure where. I was confused whether should I head back to Mumbai or should I go to my actual hometown (which is near Nagpur, Maharashtra). After, so much thinking I finally decided to go to my hometown. So, I booked a flight for 18th of March which was scheduled at 1 p.m. And on the night of 17th at 11 p.m. I left for Ahmedabad airport.  5 in the morning I reached the airport from Rajasthan...\n\nRead the rest of the story in a comment below🔻\n___________________\n#lockdowndiaries #lockdown2020 #instastories #storiesthatmatters #sukeindia #peopleofindia #peoplegallery","NumberOfLikes":72,"Hashtags":["#lockdowndiaries","#lockdown2020","#instastories","#storiesthatmatters","#sukeindia","#peopleofindia","#peoplegallery"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Suke India in Nagpur with @charcha_boi.

In the start almost all households did the entire house cleaning.\n\nLockdown also indirectly or directly meant a boom in digital marketing. Many people started their YouTube channels \n\nLockdown also meant quite a free time available at hand for fulfilling old desires and indulging in hobbies which one never had time for during the busy schedules of the old normal \n\nLockdown brought out the best of cooking skills in limelight... almost all social media platforms were flooded with photographs of people showcasing various recipe preparations\n\nLockdown meant an increase in household work, increase in stress of work-life balance, reduction in fat burning exercises, an increase in waist lines, etc \n\nWith almost no source of entertainment, one finds solace in food... As a common human mentality one wants to try out new things atleast once, especially if made by friend or neighbour then it becomes imperative by most to prepare that dish... \n\nisn't this a common scenario... Just thought of penning down my thoughts this sunday...
