During the whole spring I worked from home with the rest of the world. My work is super social and staying home made me feel pretty much alone, even though I had my husband and son with me. As I didn\u2019t have to travel to the office which is located in Helsinki, I have had more free time than ever before. I have used it for doing what I enjoy most, doing arts.\n\u2022\n\u201CDuring the spring I made animal masks out of paper mache. When the Chicken mask was completed I began to take every day life photos with it and named the series Lockdown Diaries. At the beginning of the project Chicken felt lonely, sad and laconic. Later The Chicken had also some joyous moments of letting loose.\n\u2022\n\u201CAt the moment our life here in Finland has almost normalized and COVID-19 cases are rare.

In particular, I\u2019ve been trying to pay more attention to the tiny moments of joy that show up every now and again. When I\u2019m able to be present to them, the tenor of my day changes. It\u2019s these little moments of joy that have made \u201Cthe lockdown life\u201D worth living. \u2063\n\u2063\nSo here are three random things that brought me joy today: \u2063\n\u2063\nHoliday Photos 🌄: J and I took a quick break from work to look at photos from our time in Europe. We had SO much fun reminiscing our travels - and it made us feel a bit more connected to our pre-pandemic life. \u2063\n\u2063\nThe photo I\u2019ve shared above may look unremarkable but I remember this moment very clearly. We had spent a warm summer\u2019s day wandering the mediaeval streets and scenic riverside of Bern. (My favourite part was watching dozens of people casually float down the turquoise waters of the River Aare - fascinating! See second slide). We took this selfie on a quiet street on our way back to the hotel. We were carefree, a little drunk and exhilarated from a day spent exploring a new city 😍\n\u2063\nA Cup of Coffee ☕️: I haven\u2019t been able to drink coffee in MONTHS because it was making my pregnancy symptoms worse. But today I felt an overwhelming desire for a cup of black coffee. And it was such a treat! It perked up my mood no end and gave me a much-needed boost before my workout. And thankfully, no pesky symptoms followed. \u2063\n\u2063\nDental Floss 🤷🏻\u200D♀️: I saved the most random thing for last. So over the last few months, I\u2019ve been able to solidify my habit of flossing my teeth. But a couple of days ago I ran out of floss - and I\u2019m only slightly embarrassed to admit that I really missed this little ritual. My night-time routine felt incomplete without it. So I was pretty jazzed when this box of floss arrived today! I know, I know, it doesn\u2019t take much to get me excited these days.\n\nWhat has brought you joy recently?","NumberOfLikes":72,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":10,"Timestamp":1596810209,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 07 16:23:29 CEST 2020","Location":"Bern, Switzerland"},{"CaptionText":"How nice not to hate the topic of my thesis for a change.

They are caused by infection with a variety of pathogens, including rickettsia and other types of bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. Because individual ticks can harbor more than one disease-causing agent, patients can be infected with more than one pathogen at the same time, compounding the difficulty in diagnosis and treatment. 16 tick-borne diseases of humans are known, of which four have been discovered since 2013.\n\nAs governments across the world continue to grapple with the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, China \u2014 where cases of the deadly infection were first reported \u2014 is now facing a new health threat. A disease called Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (SFTS), caused by a tick-borne virus, has killed seven and infected at least 60, setting off alarm bells among health officials in the country.\n\nA large number of the cases reported were concentrated in East China\u2019s Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, local media reported. While more than 37 people were diagnosed with SFTS in Jiangsu in the early months of 2020, 23 were later found to be infected in Anhui.\n\nComment your views 👇\n\nDo  Follow @bhartiyakanoon @bhartiyakanoon for Everything you must know about.\n\n#bhartiyakanoon👨\u200D🎓\n#indianadvocates #lawyerquotes  #lawyerinthemaking #lawyerslife #indianparliament #tickbornediseases #tickborneillness #tickbite #tickbites #tickbornedisease #lbsnaa #lawyersofinstagram #instamoods #aims #covıd19 #coronavirus #quotesofinstagram #civilservices #lockdownmeals #lockdown2020😷 #lawyersoffice  #indianlawupdates  #lockdowndiaries  #coronavírus #followforlegaflupdate #followforlike  #shareforshare","NumberOfLikes":680,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":10,"Timestamp":1596775910,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 07 06:51:50 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"💗\n.\n.\n📸: @shantanu_ranjita \nEdit: @arijit_pyne2525 \n.\n.\n#life #instagood #instagram #happy #photography #lifestyle #me #smile #motivation #beautiful #nature #instadaily #myself #fun #cute #happiness #mylife #peace #positivevibes #loveyourself #amazing #selflove #memories #travelphotography #travelgram #shorttrip #refreshment #loveyouzindagi #lockdowndiaries #enjoythelittlethings","NumberOfLikes":63,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ♥Mouli Dutta♥ in Temple Village Pathra - মন্দিরময় পাথরা with @santu_rani, @__a_r_c_a_n_e__, @suparna_setua, @ghoshmaithily30, and @pritha3721.

With a handful ingredients, this will surely gladden the soul.  This chicken dish is bold, rich, mildly spiced and saucier than the usual chicken curry, however equally memorable and nostalgic with its iconic flavors. The brightly red tomatoes is a testament to how simple flavors bloom without duress. It is swirled with thick cream, heaped with charm making this succulent and tender chicken dish my new winter favorite. \n.\nThis needs paper towels, no reservations, sleeves up, elbows on the table and torn naan or rotis to scoop up the gravy. It almost demands sharing since gathering to eat is a quintessential triumph.\n.\nTo get my ebook, shop the link in bio.\n.\nFollow @foodiesof_cakewalk for more photos and ideas\/recipes.

I\u2019m troubled by the state of our society, by the pandemic and the lockdowns, thousands of jobs in my city gone, the loss of life in Lebanon, the news that a lovely woman I know has cancer, and a beautiful family that I follow on here have lost their home. There\u2019s so much heaviness, and we are all physically isolated from one another. We weren\u2019t meant to live this way. \n.\nWhen I\u2019m struggling with life I try to take a few moments to sit out on our back steps by myself with a coffee. It\u2019s so good to get some fresh air, and getting out of my house gives me a new perspective, literally and figuratively.  A little time for self-care and our family rosary really help too. \n.\nThe longer this lockdown goes on, the more I see the importance of a strong daily rhythm. When life is confusing and uncertain, it is good to get up and do our daily work, to keep our hands busy. Unable to move freely, I am drawing inspiration from the monastic life, from those cloistered religious who choose to remain in one place, and must live an ordered day within their walls with contentment and love. \n.\nFor the first time in my life I am consistently getting up early. I have surprised myself by enjoying it, and I\u2019m craving even earlier starts. For a confirmed night owl, this could only have been a grace given to me by God. \n.\nI managed to make another contribution towards my #everybitcountschallenge again and made these Vinegared Red Onions from the Ball Preserving Blue Book. I have eight jars to add to my pantry. I have no idea what these will taste like, but isn\u2019t the colour pretty? I didn\u2019t actually grow the onions myself, but if I had, this is where I\u2019d have grown them. 😉","NumberOfLikes":169,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":24,"Timestamp":1596712770,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 06 13:19:30 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Want to know the secret behind my wet hair look? 😉 It\u2019s grease, humidity, and sweat.
