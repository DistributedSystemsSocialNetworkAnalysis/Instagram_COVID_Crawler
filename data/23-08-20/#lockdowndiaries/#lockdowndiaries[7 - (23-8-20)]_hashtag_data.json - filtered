Give me sexy Orion over Gove the goblin any day. Plus, magic thrives in uncertain times (hello Dark Ages!)\n\nAnd there is something about being stuck in your own environment for months on end that shifts your focus to nature, the seasons, the stars. Makes you shriek when you spot a sunflower finally budding in the yard, see a goldfinch springing through the park with a breadcrumb in its beak, watch the clematis on the fence in the back alley growing at least three inches a day.\n\nThere's something about the sight of a long-haired cat the colour of demerara sugar curled up on a brick wall in the sun surrounded by gently waving pink cyclamen that makes me want to, I dunno, PAINT it. And I don't think I've painted more than a skirting board since I was 12.\n\nThings feel different. My senses are looking for different things.\n\nI've become obsessed with things that smell nice, fancy shower gels, expensive perfume samples, a child's freshly washed hair, line-dried sheets, the damp mulch of a forest, sun and salt on warm skin.\n\nI want to talk to the people I've loved my whole life, I want to make sure they're ok.\n\nFunny things matter. Important things matter? Life admin drops further down the back of the sofa. But life is lived and fully felt. Joy, wonder, grief, despair.\n\nAnyway, I've got some space this month, for the first time in a while. I write websites, blogs, articles, newsletters. I enjoy putting words into an order that makes the reader feel seen and heard.

The sky was a dream and the city was waking up post lockdown. I took hundreds of terrible photographs but I tried really hard. Got a burger from Schwartz Bros and a headache from lack of water. I walked streets I'd forgotten, I spotted and stared at doorways and windows and paintings and tiled floors. I felt like I was in my very own scene from The Lake House chasing light and having no idea how to capture it. Mostly I affirmed my love of all things door especially hinges, door knockers and letter boxes; my love of a playlist I can sing along to, of wandering around and letting dusk spread over me, of driving under a summer sky with the windows down, of dreaming and hoping and praying unrealistically and then walking peacefully with my heart chattering in step with all of that.

Yesterday, we received the sad news that the @architecthusband\u2019s aunt Rose passed away so suddenly. It pains me just by typing this. Losing a loved one is difficult as it is, what more during a pandemic?\n\nHow do you console people grieving when you can\u2019t be with them in person? Is it OK to still post happy photos? Would it be insensitive to get on with our lives knowing that a huge part of someone dear to us has lost its spark?\n\nRelatives may be socially distant now, but the current situation has brought loved ones (and even strangers) closer. Everything is just a message away. Everything is just a thumbs up or heart away. We have no excuse not to be able to reach out because technology is so advanced, we can talk to someone and see someone eye to eye, with just a click of a button.\n\nAnd a click of a button I find myself doing more lately, especially when it\u2019s something about JS and #BigBoyJesse. I am not good in photography but I love collecting memories we can look back to: when we eat\/ bake\/ play\/ be silly together. Rather mundane, really, but it\u2019s worth living for every second of the day.\n\nBecause life is fickle. And we don\u2019t know when it will be taken away from us. So, go ahead and be silly. You earned that.\n\nTito Bobby, @winnie_selga , Winchell, Wilbert, Isaiah, and the whole Selga clan, our hearts are with you. Take care, always.\n\nPS: Our aunt @dalisayirasusta sent us a care package from the US (THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!) which we unboxed last Sunday and JS was so excited to try on his new Beatles shirt. Too cute not to take a photo of and post, I thought. Never in a million years did I think I would post this together with a message of condolence. üòå\n\nPPS: Yes, Jesse was shirtless because he just had champorado (chocolate porridge) for breakfast and he always makes a mess when he eats it. So, shirtless he was. üòä\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#architecthusband #JourneyWithBigBoyJesse #familyfirstalways #fatherandsontime #ilovemyhusband #ilovemyson #gettingsilly #familymatters #lockdowndiaries #lockdownmemories #quarantinestories #quarantinetime #lockdowndiaries #stayathomesavelives #stayathomestaysafe","NumberOfLikes":21,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by ABBIE VALLE SELGA on August 03, 2020 tagging @thebeatles, @winnie_selga, @dalisayirasusta, @bequalshappiness, and @architecthusband.

That bought lots of time for chores. By the time she had explored happily and found me, I could tick things off my list. \n- We are happy to report that we managed to clean co-worker Nina after her Yogurt exfoliation and didn't need to just replace her. \n- Co-worker Marli enjoyed some art time with her new watercolor paint set, she also painted some superhero stripes on her new pants and added a unibrow to her face. The unibrow is now semi-permanent as the paint stained her face. \n- Pieter made use of the kitchen to desk Kauai service this morning to order his smoothie. He also received some grown up beverages like coffee of course (Cough* Hot Chocolate). \n- The office were treated to a buffet lunch of scrambled eggs on hot dog buns and viennas on hotdogs all made by HR. There would have been only viennas on hotdogs, but some Viennas mysteriously dissapeared and no one knows where when HR questioned them. \n- HR and co- worker Marli did some watercolor painting. She said my painting is ugly...Probably a good thing she'll be homeschooled so that there's just one person to be honest with and not a class full. \n- We are currently baking some muffins and the small people have been released into the wild (front yard).\n.\nSincerely,\nHR\n.\n~ 21 May 2020","NumberOfLikes":25,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1596463157,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 03 15:59:17 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"\u2022 \"Lockdown Office\" Home Hub Update - Day 58 \u2022 \n.\n- Today could have been better. \n- Co-worker Nina showed up to work at 2am.
