Little did I know, a few months later, a global pandemic would hit and there would be no going back to Mumbai anytime soon. Now, with even more strict lockdown rules around Victoria, this picture feels like it was from a lifetime ago. But I am going to take the advice I read on @priyaserrao \u2018s account and reframe the situation and look at all the positive energy in this photo and count my blessings. I am really lucky to be here. I have good people around me and country of concerned citizens trying their best to follow the rules and contain this virus. We can do this Melbourne!

August now, who would have thought last month could go so quick after the dragging desperate spring weeks. Love our little stall at the end of the night when its all cleaned down, shipshape, everything in its place ready for the next time. The fire is dying, burning off the last left over dough. It\u2019s not welcome left festering in a bin. And yes, we could be thoroughly #artisan and be baking off #sourdough @vanessakimbell loaves but hey it\u2019s late. An it\u2019s only a bit of flour n water anyway. Better convert to energy #cookingonpizzapower. Lovely customers again, the demographic is so wide here, so many interesting insights into diverse lives and experiences. Met a fab couple tonight: way too young to be teachers 😀, vegan pizza ordered and they told us that their lockdown was completely furloughed free time. They teach in an inner city school. No point in online lessons, most of their pupils have little access to the digital world, few have more than one computer in the house, and the school quickly realised that teaching via a mobile phone was unfeasable. But they are hopeful and optimistic about the autumn term, they will pick up where they left off and scoop those kids up back into learning. We asked the question Pubs vs Schools and they laughed and said that honestly both were doable, and besides, after a difficult week they deserved a beer or two. Second that.

Even the Eid messages were full of \"keep safe\" and memes of sheep wearing masks. \n\nWe've been in lockdown for 4.5 months now. And yesterday was another reminder of the weird times we're living in. I think for many people the idea of not spending it with their loved ones was just too painful to skip. We caught up with family through video calls and chats but I acknowledge that it's not the same.\n\nI'm hoping that we get some normality back next year whether it's celebrating Eid, Christmas or Diwali. I know it's tough to be away from your loved ones, especially when you're craving human interaction, but if they didn't visit you, know that they're doing what they can to keep themselves and others safe, and isn't that an act of love too?\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#lockdownthoughts #lockdowneid #motivationalthoughts #sidehustles #beinspired #staypositive #eidmemes #lifeskills #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":61,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1596359863,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 02 11:17:43 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Gift for all my friends...miss u school buddies...\n#friendshipday❤️ \n.\n.\nFollow on IG\/FB for more @the_empty_wordsmith \n.\n.\nLike💝  Comment💌| Share💫| Tag 📌\n.\n.\n.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n.\n.\n#friendshipdayspecial\n#friendshipdayquotes\n#friendshipdaygifts #yourquoteandmine \n#yourquote #yourquotes\n#nojoto #nojotoofficial\n#covid_19 #coronavirus \n#lockdown #instadaily\n#lockdowndiaries \n#writersofinstagram \n#writerscommunity \n#writersofig \n#iwrite #writers\n#the_indian_writers11 \n#rahatindori \n#mirzaghalib \n#gulzar \n#gulzarsahab \n#instagram \n#team_of_poet05\n#pod\n#yourdreamnetwork","NumberOfLikes":37,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by @the_empty_wordsmith on August 02, 2020 tagging @the_empty_wordsmith.

That\u2019s normal and part of the aging process but it\u2019s also something that\u2019s easy to overlook. I often want to be doing what I see others doing, but the reality is I do have some issues, I\u2019m older and it\u2019s just physically not always possible \n.\nSO ... I\u2019m trying to embrace that 😬 and today I set out not knowing how far I\u2019d go. I was determined to run easy and to turn around if it got sore but it actually felt really good - which is just so exciting after battling this injury since January! 🤦🏼\u200D♀️\n.\nI\u2019ve only been running from my door locally, early (and solo) to avoid the crowds for weeks now and I\u2019m loathe to complain about it. I know I say it (ad nauseam 🙄) but I\u2019m thankful every day for the ability to run and for running itself, for the beautiful trails I\u2019m surrounded by and for everyone who is doing the right thing to get us through this. And it was so lovely to see some familiar Westerfoldian faces today on the MYT 🦹🏼\u200D♀️💚\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#staysafe #stayhome #isorunning #melbourneinstarunners #instarunners #igrunners #runnersofig #restandrecovery #australianinstarunners #runningcommunity #thisinjurylife #seenonmyrun #greyhairdontcare #wearetherunners #womensrunningcommunity #trailchix #lockdowndiaries #stage4lockdown #running #parkrunner #garminau #garmin #happyplace #dotherightthing #stravarun #easyrunning #runningfriends #runningmotivation #runfromhome2020 #garminfenix6","NumberOfLikes":105,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":7,"Timestamp":1596347428,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 02 07:50:28 CEST 2020","Location":"Main Yarra Trail"},{"CaptionText":"#lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":1,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Bruce Ring in Albert Park and Lake.

I love you all and I'm really looking forward to getting to meet so many new faces (when I get around to confirming your appointments!)\n\nSpeak to you soon\n\nKristy xx","NumberOfLikes":53,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Reiki Master✨Healer✨Alchemist on August 01, 2020.

And you can see, if you scroll down, they took my Mandala to a whole new level. \n\nDuring this lockdown, all I had was my simple black pen (since all of my stationery\u2019s at my hostel, in Delhi). For a long time, I couldn\u2019t order them on Amazon either. \n\nSo, here\u2019s another Mandala that I\u2019d made during the Lockdown using a simple #blackpen.

I lived in denial, and it affected my quality of life. \u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\nRecently, I learnt that neglecting my low times, makes me less aware and less\u2063 appreciative of my up times. It makes me less aware, and therefore, appreciative of the joys that come my way like finding #1500 in the pocket of your jeans on the first wear after a wash. \u2063\n \u2063\nThis does not mean that I should wallow in self-pity in my low times. \u2063\nIt means that I should acknowledge and not ignore these feelings that are not so pretty and convenient. So should you. \u2063\n\u2063\nSometimes, we try to ignore these inconvenient feelings because, duh, they\u2019re not convenient! \u2063\n\u2063\nDon\u2019t cheat yourself of all lifehas to offer. Allow yourself feel, even when it\u2019s inconvenient. \u2063\n\u2063\nWant to cry? Go ahead. \u2063\n\u2063\nWant to sleep? Go ahead. \u2063\n\u2063\nWant to write about it? Go on ahead! \u2063\n\u2063\nWant to write about it? Knock yourself out.\u2063\n\u2063\nLearn to feel, learn to cope and learn to\u2063 push through those feelings. And just like strawberries have seasons that come and go, this too, will pass. \u2063\n\u2063\nI have realised that it always helps to\u2063\ntalk to God about it. He fully knows, and He understands every single bit. That\u2063 numb and light feeling that you cannot explain, He gets. Some linger a lot more\u2063 than others, but there is always laughter after the tears. \u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\nHeb 13:5b says \u201Cℐ 𝓌𝒾𝓁𝓁 𝓃ℯ𝓋ℯ𝓇 𝓁ℯ𝒶𝓋ℯ 𝓎ℴ𝓊;\u2063\n𝓃ℯ𝓋ℯ𝓇 𝓌𝒾𝓁𝓁 ℐ 𝒻ℴ𝓇𝓈𝒶𝓀ℯ 𝓎ℴ𝓊\u201D. That\u2019s one of Gods promises to you. \u2063\n\u2063\nThere is a line in a hymn that says: \u201CI\u2019m standing on the promises of God\u201D. \u2063 That\u2019s a sure place to stand. \u2063\n\u2063\nWelcome to August!!! \n\u2063\nRemember to feel, remember to cope and remember that Jesus loves you. \u2063\n\u2063\n\n#newmonth #feels #sad #lonely #bibleverse #hymn #promises #God  #laughter #tears #August #alarm #humor #acknowleyourfeelings #lockdowndiary #lockdowndiaries #biblequote #live\n\u2063\n.\u2063","NumberOfLikes":47,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1596273511,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 01 11:18:31 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Decided to go for a long walk to the lake as soon as I woke up.

A little mess as it seemed in the beginning when we were all locked down, inside our homes, frustrated that we couldn't step out, was an uninvited guest in disguise. Sooner, the small creeper has become a part of our everyday life. Little it seemed, so negligent it's existence was in our daily lives, sooner became our little pet. Of course we didn't nurture it nor gave our undeviating attention. But we did use to observe its growth and also the bright green leaves and it's curly tentacle. A month back, with the beginning of rain after a break of few months, we started seeing the blossoming of flowers on it. Which soon will be an exotic fruit, Passion fruit. \nVery recently, our landlord has cut down the creeper that was growing wildly over our balcony, in fear of any threat from reptiles or also the inconveniences it can cause to the luxury of our human lives. Now the creeper is a controlled plant in our neighbors courtyard. But, it has become one of ours. We see it everyday, budding and blossoming! \n.\n.\n.\n#sidgraphy #littlestoriesofmylife #littlethingsinlife #backyardbliss #passionfruit #buddingtrees #lifestylenewborn #lockdowndiaries #storiestotell #photographers_of_india #india_gram #indiapictures #moodygramskerala #moodygrams #moodygrams5k #colors_of_day_macro #naturephotograpy #natureart #dewdrops #igtones5k","NumberOfLikes":90,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Siddharth Saji in Hebbal, Mysore.
