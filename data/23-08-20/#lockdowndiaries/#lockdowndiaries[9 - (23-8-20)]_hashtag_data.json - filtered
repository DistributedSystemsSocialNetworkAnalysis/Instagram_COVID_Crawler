Yes? No? Just me? Come on, you know you're guilty. :P Lockdown got us all going back to casual chic - or \"slob chic\", as a recent New Yorker article put it. It's liberating in a way, there's no fashion paralysis to go through every morning. On the other hand, it means all them high heels and dresses are basically on permanent vacation. :S One thing I have invested in, though, is fitness outfits. If you're getting into exercise, I absolutely recommend you get yourself some proper gear. Trust me when I say you NEED them for proper support and flexibility. Jockey has some great tops and bottoms if you don't want to spend a fortune. Decathlon is great too. I visited the Brigade Road outlet for the first time ever recently and it's so cool!

Baking banana bread? Does this life in lockdown story sound familiar? Like many of us, Lydia has found lockdown has given her an opportunity to slow down and focus on things that are important to her and make her happy. As a Christian and member of the Regent Hall church family, one of things that has been important to Lydia has been connecting with God and others by praying and reading the Bible with friends.\n.\nLydia came to Regent Hall when she started her medicine degree five years ago. During lockdown, Lydia has volunteered at her local GP surgery. She called patients who were shielding, offering practical and wellbeing support and advice. She says: \u201CI am just so grateful to God that I was given that opportunity just to play a small role in those people\u2019s lives.\u201D\n.\nLydia is about to start a university placement in a hospital and asks that we pray for her and her fellow students - that they will be safe, useful and helpful during this difficult time.\n.\nWatch Lydia\u2019s life in lockdown testimony in Sunday worship from 26 July on our YouTube channel.

(FB PAGE : Binal's collection of Short Stories and Quotes)\n\nOnce upon a time, there lived a tailor and her son. One day, due to school holiday, the son visited his mother tailor's work-place. \nBeing too young, his mother made him sit on a stool nearby, at a distance from where they could both see each other. Son saw that his mother would use scissors to cut the clothes, and then would keep aside the scissors besides her feet. Then she would sew clothes with the needle and thread, and after sewing would keep the needles on the scarf worn on the head. \nAfter looking on this sequel for half a dozen times, the son went over to his mother, and said \"May i ask you a question mother?\" Mother replied 'Yes son, what do you want to ask?'\nSon - \"Mother, i am seeing you since a long time. When you cut the clothes, after that you tuck the scissors below your feet; and after you sew the clothes, you keep the needles on your head. Why so?\" \nThe answer which his mother gave,  seemed like she gave an entire life's lesson to her son in two lines. \nMother answered lovingly, \"Son, the scissors work is to cut, and needles work is to sew; And a cutters' place is always down(below), but a sewers place is always at the top. This is the reason that i keep the needles on my scarf and scissors below the feet.\" \n\nMoral:\nIf in Life one wants to reach to the Top, Then one should be Like a Needle and SEW, and not be a Scissor (cutter).\n\nDo like, share and comment this story.\nVisit this section, for more such stories and Quotes at \nFacebook.com\/storiesandquotes1\nAnd\nHappy Reading 🙂\n\nFollow me @artbyforam for more of such arts❤\n.\nDM for Order!\n\n#pencilsketch #realisticdrawing #sketch #sketchartist #pencildrawing #art #artist #artwork #artistsoninstagram #artistsofinstagram #artoftheday #artofinstagram #sketchbook #sketching #sketches #sketchbookdrawing #sketchoftheday #sketchdaily #sketchaday #sketchart #sketchers #pencil #pencilart #pencils #potrait #lockdowndiaries #darshanraval #bluefamily #Darshaners #singlepencilsketch","NumberOfLikes":31,"Hashtags":["#pencilsketch","#realisticdrawing","#sketch","#sketchartist","#pencildrawing","#art","#artist","#artwork","#artistsoninstagram","#artistsofinstagram","#artoftheday","#artofinstagram","#sketchbook","#sketching","#sketches","#sketchbookdrawing","#sketchoftheday","#sketchdaily","#sketchaday","#sketchart","#sketchers","#pencil","#pencilart","#pencils","#potrait","#lockdowndiaries","#darshanraval","#bluefamily","#Darshaners","#singlepencilsketch"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1596119988,"LocalDate":"Thu Jul 30 16:39:48 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"nilufar__16","CaptionText":"#thursday  #thursdaymotivation #lockdowndiaries #lockdownsessions","NumberOfLikes":19,"Hashtags":["#thursday","#thursdaymotivation","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdownsessions"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Nilufar Matin in Gauhati.

This one is from Keonjhar) \nAnd chillies to add zing\n\nHabisa dalema is made primarily in the Kartika month of Hindu calendar. This is considered an auspicious month and people fast in varied ways offering their oblations by abstaining from non vegetarian food. A section of people follow strict diet during this month an eat only sattvic food consisting of specific vegetables. \n\nHabisa dalema is the limelight of this kartika month diet. Made by boiling a handful of roasted split green gram, taro, raw banana and oou(elephant apple) with a little salt and then tempered with ghee, jeera and red chillies, topped with some roasted cumin- chilli powder \nAnd some freshly grated coconut. \n\nFor those of you wondering what is elephant apple, stay tuned for the next post. As for the taste of the ingredient, it's predominantly sour and slightly astringent. In the absence of elephant apple one could add a dash of lime mixed with buttermilk. It will make up for the absence of oou but can replace the flavour. I have used dried oou sourced from my mom last year. This doesn't add as much tang as the fresh fruit, but surely imparts the same flavour. \n\nDo give it a try.\n\n#odiyafood #odiyacuisine #loveforcooking #loveodisha #odiyafoodie #missinghome #dilsefoodie #lockdowndiaries  #homecooking #odiyafoodlove #odishafood #poipatrabara #poipatra #malabarspinach #lostrecepiesofodisha\n#foodsatisfaction #foodiesofbhubaneswar #foodiesofinstagram #foodislife #foodistherapy #loveforcooking #cookingwithlove #cookingtherapy #odiyafoodlovers #odiyarecipe #habisa #habisadalma","NumberOfLikes":38,"Hashtags":["#odiyafood","#odiyacuisine","#loveforcooking","#loveodisha","#odiyafoodie","#missinghome","#dilsefoodie","#lockdowndiaries","#homecooking","#odiyafoodlove","#odishafood","#poipatrabara","#poipatra","#malabarspinach","#lostrecepiesofodisha","#foodsatisfaction","#foodiesofbhubaneswar","#foodiesofinstagram","#foodislife","#foodistherapy","#loveforcooking","#cookingwithlove","#cookingtherapy","#odiyafoodlovers","#odiyarecipe","#habisa","#habisadalma"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":6,"Timestamp":1596102882,"LocalDate":"Thu Jul 30 11:54:42 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"azad__lafz","CaptionText":"Krishna and Sudama , the best example of friendship. \nWaise to we should celebrate friendship every single day...but lets take to this day..making it more special for our friends.\n.\nOkay too much of appreciation done!😒\nDear friends ,\nyou all are monkeys.\nI wish to irritate you all throughout 😁.\n.\nHappy Friendship Day❤️\n.\nDo not forget to tag your monkeys😂.\n.\nAlso do not forget to watch Yaara @mevidyutjammwal\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#friendship #friends4ever #loveandinspiration #nomoregrudges #loveyouall #missyouall #seeyousoon\n#lockdowndiaries #friendsarelife #yaar #yaariyan #vidyutjammwal #yaarateriyaari #likhawatdilse❤️\n#krishnaandsudama","NumberOfLikes":102,"Hashtags":["#friendship","#friends4ever","#loveandinspiration","#nomoregrudges","#loveyouall","#missyouall","#seeyousoon","#lockdowndiaries","#friendsarelife","#yaar","#yaariyan","#vidyutjammwal","#yaarateriyaari","#likhawatdilse❤️","#krishnaandsudama"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by @azad__lafz on July 30, 2020 tagging @mevidyutjammwal, @friends, @__adiittii__, @a21_ayushi, and @azad__lafz.
