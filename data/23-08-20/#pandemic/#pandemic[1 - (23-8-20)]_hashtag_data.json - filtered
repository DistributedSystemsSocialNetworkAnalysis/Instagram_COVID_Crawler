When we are experiencing grief, anxiety, mental spin cycles, self-judgment, transitions in life, being a caregiver, health issues, trauma, wanting to connect with ourselves or all of the above, life can feel like a lot (hello 2020!). These simple meditations are intentionally designed to give you permission to take a moment for yourself, whenever and wherever you are.\n\nFilled with a variety of affirming words, grounding reminders and physical guidance, these cards can be an anchor during life\u2019s overwhelming and often uncertain times. We, and those closest to us, can benefit from us pausing; to breathe, to move, to find stillness in the storm, no matter how big or how small that storm may be. There are days that a single raindrop can feel like a raging tempest, so not judgement ok?\n\nAccess these meditations in whatever way works best for \u200Byou.\u200B Offered as convenient pocket-sized cards, an MP3 and an ebook with the option of adding a mini journal and pen.

Ganjian, @lindaganjian a Queens-based artist who works in a variety of materials, including clay, cement and paper. Her main pursuit has involved making large \u201Ctabletop\u201D sculptures, composed of hundreds of miniature forms, that are a reinterpretation of Middle Eastern and American craft traditions (carpets, quilts, calligraphy). Much of her work presents memories and impressions of the urban landscape, the specific history of a site or more personal narratives. \n\n\u201C7 Train Panoramas\u201D is a sculptural interpretation of the rooftop architecture visible from the 7 train, organized into a quilt-like structure. The forms (made from clay and painted paper-board) reflect the haphazard array of satellite dishes, antenna, skylights, vents, barbed wire, graffiti, etc., she says, \"that mark the landscape my eyes glaze over on my daily commute.\"\n\nWe want to see, hear, feel, support your art and response to this moment.

Wherever restrictions are eased, it erupts stronger than before, infecting younger and younger people, and with strains up to ten times more contagious. As temperatures begin to drop and outdoor entertainment becomes less appealing, people will either avoid going out or attend indoors events and increase the already high risk of contagion. At the same time, those who stay home can expect irritation and low spirits, at best, and temper tantrums are more than likely. And worst of all, domestic violence is bound to soar.\n\nAlso, as jobs run out and scores fall into a cash-flow crisis, food insecurity and disconnection from utilities will become commonplace. In that state, hopelessness coupled with the tense upcoming elections will exacerbate street violence, homicide, looting, and arsons to the point where they become routine. In many towns and neighborhoods, people will not dare set foot outside their homes. Unless something changes fast, we\u2019d better prepare for a very tough winter.\n\nBut if anything can change, it is the future. The future is always in our hands to shape. And now is our last call to shape our society into a community, a congregation of accountable individuals who are responsible for one another and do not let other people fall by the wayside just because they\u2019re not on my political, racial, or ethnic side.\n\nWe are living the final days before the collapse, but we haven\u2019t fallen yet. We can eyeball the hatred in our hearts and tell it, \u201CThe more you grow, the more we the people will unite. It is only thanks to you, hatred, that we tighten our bond.\u201D\nIt\u2019s natural for opposites to dislike one another. Love between people of conflicting views always requires hard work. But precisely because of it, it is the only love that you can truly say you chose of your own volition. Only when you rise above your natural inclination can you say that you have made a free choice.

Dr. Neuman will speak about issues that concern childhood education, share knowledge to guide parents and students on education, provide suggestions and ideas on how to handle different situations, answer any questions posed, and promote mutual support during these challenging times.\nWe hope to see all parents, guardians, educators, and students there!\n\nFree registration: \nhttps:\/\/branchoutread.eventbrite.com\n\nInstagram: branchoutveritas\nTwitter: VeritasUSCECC\nFacebook: Veritas Education Leaders\nYoutube: Veritas Education\nEmail: velbranchout@gmail.com\n \n#branchout #STEM #volunteer #nonprofit #community #science #rolemodels #advocacy #hope #unity #literacy #reading #writing #impact #learning #education#tutoring #leadership #parents #pandemic #teamwork #friends #inspire #givingback #teacher #innovation #creativity #dc #maryland #virginia","NumberOfLikes":17,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598133883,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 00:04:43 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#Pandemic hair...😷 To cut or to keep growing?? 🤔 What ya think?? \n\u2022\n\u2022\n#haircut #yayornay #needyourhelp #covid_19 #brunettes #girlswithglasses","NumberOfLikes":6,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Cecily Van Horn in Montreal, Quebec.

The flow got you to where you are, now you have to exit the ride and start a walk back, alone, that is a solo, unique journey. No one can walk it for you, it is much more uncomfortable than just status quo living (whatever that was for us). So, when you are faced with heavy, weighty feelings and periods of anxiety and depression because you are waking up to truth and choosing better for yourself, be thankful and comforted in knowing this is part of processing and healing. You will come through it, it\u2019s part of the journey. This doesn\u2019t mean ruminating endlessly, but sitting with feelings, not running from thoughts and ideas and zoning out. Dealing with the questions and conclusions and accepting them for the truths they are. Being there with yourself as you go along this road is the best thing you can do\u2014you are getting somewhere. Letting emotions come up and be felt and acknowledged, understanding your past in new ways, wanting and yearning for more in the future\u2014let your soul process this, all of it. What awaits on the other side is a new level of being. And this process continues as long as we partner with it. 💜 #womanreleased #emotionalabuse #emotionalhealth #awakening #codependencyrecovery #narcissisticabuse #covertabuse #trauma #gaslighting #cptsd #selfhealers #worldhealers #pandemic x#sabbath #sabbathrest #spiritualabuse #reset #wakeup #repentance #truth #God #purpose #heal #lead #joinvoices #releasetheworld #jubilee #youarereleased #collectivetrauma #amplifylove","NumberOfLikes":2,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Womanreleased on August 22, 2020.

As it got darker, the moon shone brighter and I couldn't do anything but stand in my balcony awestruck, admiring this perfect beauty. I don't know what to do with this feeling but share it.\n\nI've had the hardest couple of months. I've felt lost, isolated, lonely and cold. Everything has been on a standstill for me but nature has been on the go. I've seen the most beautiful sunsets, the most beautiful skies, the most beautiful clouds, and the happiest birds. The sharp contrast between my entrapped life and the wandering clouds and chirpy birds confused me. It was as if all that was false, everything human, was shattering and the truth was flowering. Everything true, everything which was connected to the divine, everything we ignored all this time, was the brightest. The sky is one such thing that kept me close to life. Its palette was different every day and brought to me change on the most monotonous days. Even when I was surrounded by the same four walls, it helped me see things with new eyes every single day. When I had nothing to look up to, it made me fall in love with its magnificent view. It absorbed all my anger and dissolved my anxieties into its hues. It filled me with hope when I was the most helpless and gave me strength when I couldn't function. It helped me smile on the gravest of days. And gave me goosebumps when I couldn't feel. The sky and all its components have blessed me and kept me moving forward day after day. When the phone didn't help, games felt boring and I felt exhausted, it stirred me with its impeccable beauty. I'll never forget all that it has taught me. I'm forever gonna bow down to this heavenly beauty, no matter where I am and what I'm doing. I'm always gonna take out time to connect with the divine because now I know, when everything shatters down, it is nature that lifts you up and gets you moving. It's these small unimportant but so immensely important bits of life which set you free.","NumberOfLikes":25,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1598129622,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 22:53:42 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"2019 ☀️✨🙈 viejita😂\n\n❤️\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n#planet #instagay #bajacalifornia #world #love #journey #picoftheday #travelgram #nature #california #mexico #bestplacestogo #instagood #cactus #blackandwhite #instagram #adventure #photooftheday #pandemic #picsart #travelphotography #gaylove #happy #wonderful #black #traveller #followme #travellers #white #influencers","NumberOfLikes":117,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Dany Carbajal in Catedral de Guadalajara.

What do you reach for when you have a rough day?\n\u2022\nHonestly guys, I haven\u2019t always reached for good things. I\u2019ve had times when I slept for 16 hours a day to avoid depression. I had times when I drank like my friends did, even though I felt shitty to feel \u201Cnormal\u201D. & my life has been a constant struggle of emotional eating.\n\u2022\nSo, how do we determine what is the \u201Cright\u201D thing to reach for? Truthfully, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a big one-size fits all answer. Holding my dog and knowing she\u2019s there might work for me, but do nothing for someone else.\n\u2022\nYou have to do what makes YOUR heart feel good. If you\u2019re going through a breakup or friend split, don\u2019t drink because someone told you to. If you are doing poorly in school, don\u2019t reach for food because it helps fit your stomach up... focus on your heart.\n\u2022\nToday, I feel really really sick. I\u2019ve been moving, lifting, and hauling all week. Not to mention, I\u2019m so behind with work I could scream. So - here\u2019s what I\u2019ll be reaching for: \n💖my dog, of course\n💖 my bed with all my fav pillows and blankets\n💖a big water bottle for right next to me\n💖my laptop to ease my mind while I have moments of relaxation\n💖 a COVID test, because you can NEVER be too safe.\n\u2022\nOdds are, I don\u2019t have #coronavirus. No exposure that I know of & it\u2019s only been a day and a half feeling like this. But, feeling ill is so much more important to communicate now. As someone who works, nannies, and lives with roommates, it\u2019s important for me to take extreme precaution - as should everyone! If you\u2019re not feeling well, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don\u2019t be scared of a test or communicating that. It\u2019s the only way we\u2019re going learn how to safely live in this time 💖\n\u2022\nSo, I\u2019m not having a fun time today. I\u2019m reaching for my dog. I\u2019m blessed to have something that makes me feel good. What do you reach for when you\u2019re day is 100%?\n#instablogger #teddybeardog #dogsofinsta  #mydog #emyd #emydblog #feelingsick #sickday #comfort #comfortzone #emotionalsupportanimal #covidtesting #covid19 #pandemic #illness #emotional #emotionalintelligence #mentalhealthbloggers #bloggersofwisconsin #wisconsin","NumberOfLikes":34,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by EmyD || Blogger & PR Queen in Madison, Wisconsin.

We make plans and God laughs at them?\n\nI have been reading so many of you post about how this pandemic has impacted your lives over the past few months. The hardest adjustment for me has been how much it threw off my plans for my babies. Eleanor got 💯 of me before the age of 2. And then started her pre-school and loved it. The plan was for C4 to then get that same one on one time with me once she started. But then Covid hit and all of us began to stay home. And my attention was pulled between the two of them. I have definitely carried my share of mom guilt when it comes to C4, feeling that he hasn\u2019t received as much as Eleanor did. But then a few loving friends have reminded me that he is surrounded by love daily. The love of us his parents and sister and Coco. And the reminder that birth order is a real thing. \n\nI love this baby boy so much. And I\u2019m grateful for the moments I get to sneak in or try to intentionally have just with him. He\u2019s added so much joy to our family. So much love. So much beauty.

As a health care professional and infant wellness advocate, I think it\u2019s important to share this information to keep little ones safe.\n\nSwipe for why babies SHOULD NOT wear face masks ➡️\n\nTo keep children safe in the pandemic, Perinatal Services BC and the CDC recommend the following:\n\n- Frequent hand washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds\n- Physical distancing for the caregiver and baby from other individuals outside of the immediate household\n- If soap and water are not available, most liquid hand sanitizers (containing minimum 60% alcohol) can be used instead by adults and children\n- Hand sanitizer should not be used on preterm or newborn infants due to the continued developmental changes of the skin.\n- Supervision must be provided to children younger than six years of age when using hand sanitizers, as studies have shown that even small amounts of the ingested liquid can lead to alcohol poisoning\n\nSuggestions on how to keep the infant\/child safe when taken out into the public:\n\n- Cover the infant\/child carrier with a light blanket or breathable cover, instead of the infant\/child directly. This will create a protective barrier while allowing infant\/child to breathe comfortably.\n- The infant\/child should be frequently monitored while the blanket is covering the carrier to ensure safety and that they are not overheating.\n- The blanket should be removed when not in a public place or when the parent or guardian has no direct view of the infant\/child.","NumberOfLikes":13,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1598124261,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 21:24:21 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Imagine a meet after this pandemic with your loved ones ❤️.\n\n#love #yaari #family #friendship #bff #mirakee #yourquotes #writersnetwork #pandemic #friendshipquotes #lovequotes #oneliners #shayar #shayari #piyushmishra #writersofig #wordporn #writing #writer #shayari #shayarilover","NumberOfLikes":18,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Dhawal Sao in Ramtek.

The company was founded in the 1980s by a group of planners and economists from the Department of City and Regional Planning at UC Berkeley. According to the company website, they\u2019ve specialized in exploring the economic development opportunities that emerge from improving environmental quality.\n\nThe biggest overall takeaway from the report is that the legal cannabis industry continues to show significant market potential for additional legal sales throughout California.\n\nBut local #governments have proven their own worst enemy in the past. Roughly 75% of cities continue to ban access to legal marijuana by local decry according to Weedmaps\u2019 data. And the only way to capture much of the lost revenue is if the number of retail cannabis establishments expands to meet local demand in those communities that do not currently have legal retail cannabis sales.\n-\n\u201CThe state\u2019s underperforming retail cannabis market, the range of potential market support has significant upside. The market demand already exists, with most of the demand currently met through illicit sales channels that generate no tax revenues,\u201D the report\u2019s authors noted in an announcement. One of the points of hope for the market is California\u2019s cannabis tax receipts totaled over $635 million in 2019, certainly a big jump from the $397 million collected in 2018.\n-\nContinued in Comments","NumberOfLikes":139,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by 🌐 Beard Bros Pharms™🌐 in Los Angeles, California with @laweekly, @thejimidevine, and @beardbros_pharms.
