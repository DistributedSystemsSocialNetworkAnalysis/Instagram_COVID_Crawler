The truth is that im far from the end of healing completely from years of mental pain and illness but i finally feel like I'm in the mental head space of being able to get trough this. I was really hopping through the pandemic I would post regularly to keep an accurate record of what life was like when the world was shut down but in reality that makes my 'diary' so much more real because during my darkest days I was basically a ghost to the world around me. As for the future of this account im going to try my best to keep updating and posting. As I heal from my own traumas I hope ill be able to  inspire others to reach out and talk about their problems with professionals because after all a problem shared is a problem halved. I hope that eventually this will make a beautiful recovery story and turn into a space filled with only love and  positivity. I hope to feel confident enough to share parts of my story with you in the near future because mental illness is the realist thing in today's world and no one should ever suffer alone.

Customers then can select the quality and level of meat, based on how long the beef has been aged. Diners also choose and cook their own ingredients, ranging from meat and seafood to vegetables, and cook them at communal tables.\nFor now, the lounge offers a tight menu of oyster shooters, wagyu beef sushi, seafood platters, and marinated cherry tomatoes.\nWhen the dining room opens, X Pot will feature performances that include ancient Chinese face-changing ceremonies, noodle dances, and table animation shows, each paired with its smart-robot technology.

Congress heard the (bugle) call and responded with what #SenateMajorityLeader #MitchMcConnell (R-KY) called a \u201Cwartime level of investment¬†into our nation.\u201D\nCalling #coronavirus (#COVId19) the \u201C#invisibleenemy,\u201Dü§£ü§£ the president has called for \u201Cshared sacrifices\u201D and a \u201Cresponse¬†unseen since World War II.\u201D\nThe president is getting a hefty fiscal fix through a $2 trillion stimulus spending bill moving to his desk shortly for signature. Spanning nearly twenty years of conflict, the #warsinIraq and #Afghanistan cost the #taxpayer¬†roughly $1.5 trillion dollars ü§îü§î by comparison.\nThe stakes are high, and no one is immune. The military is ramping up to support state and local authorities in responding to the pandemic. The Department of Defense is also confronting the rise of infected servicemembers, families, and defense civilians, all while it deals with impacts on the defense industrial base \u2014 the Defense Department needs this new funding.\nDefense spending in the stimulus totals $10.5 billion, with likely more to come later. Of this, $1 billion is allocated to the Defense Production Act (DPA), and the bill waives several restrictions to supercharge it for pandemic recovery. Other priorities include $1.5 billion for working capital funds, $1.2 billion for uniformed personnel, $2 billion for Operations and Maintenance, nearly $5 billion for the Defense Health Program, and $2.8 million for the Armed Forces Retirement Home.\nThis funding demands strident¬†supervision. Mark Cancian from the Center for Strategic and International Studies¬†explained that¬†the Defense Department\u2019s original request for supplemental emergency funds involved the creation of a \u201Cslush fund.\u201D Congress rejected the concept and used various provisions to strike a helpful¬†balance between the immediate funding needs of the U.S. military .","NumberOfLikes":134,"Hashtags":["#PresidentTrump","#wartime","#pandemic","#SenateMajorityLeader","#MitchMcConnell","#coronavirus","#COVId19)","#invisibleenemy,\u201Dü§£ü§£","#warsinIraq","#Afghanistan","#taxpayer¬†roughly"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1598149138,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 04:18:58 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"\"Blue Boy\", Tony Gordon\n.\n36\" x 24\", oil\n.\nIn BLUES, www.plasticclub.org\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#plasticclub #Blues #oilpainting #artlife #art #phillyart #phillygram #phillylove #philly #philadelphia #igers #igers_philly #igers_street #instadelphia #instagood #inspiration #instagram #whyilovephilly #theplasticclub  #camacstreet #artistsalley #gayborhood #gayborhoodphilly #love #quarantineart #socialdistancing #coronaart #coronaartmuseum #pandemic #stayinplace","NumberOfLikes":27,"Hashtags":["#plasticclub","#Blues","#oilpainting","#artlife","#art","#phillyart","#phillygram","#phillylove","#philly","#philadelphia","#igers","#igers_philly","#igers_street","#instadelphia","#instagood","#inspiration","#instagram","#whyilovephilly","#theplasticclub","#camacstreet","#artistsalley","#gayborhood","#gayborhoodphilly","#love","#quarantineart","#socialdistancing","#coronaart","#coronaartmuseum","#pandemic","#stayinplace"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The Plastic Club on August 22, 2020.

He conducted an experiment focusing on the conflict between obedience to authority and personal conscience.\n\n65% (two-thirds) of participants continued to the highest level of 450 volts. All the participants continued to 300 volts.\n\nConclusion - Ordinary people are likely to follow orders given by an authority figure, even to the extent of killing an innocent human being.  Obedience to authority is ingrained in us all from the way we are brought up.\n\nPeople tend to obey orders from other people if they recognize their authority as morally right and\/or legally based. This response to legitimate authority is learned in a variety of situations, for example in the family, school, and workplace. \n\n\"The extreme willingness of adults to go to almost any lengths on the command of an authority constitutes the chief finding of the study and the fact most urgently demanding explanation.\" - Stanley Milgram\n\nThis right here is something that should be known far and wide. This experiment proves the absolute importance of psychology, both of the Individual and the Crowd, and showcases just how much blind belief in any authority figure is one of the most dangerous belief that exists in our world today. What one needs to understand is that we live in a society that is run by those who do NOT have the best interest of Humanity at heart. They have a very advance Knowledge of Human Psychology and know exactly which buttons to press to make an Individual tick the way they want him\/her to tick.\n\nIn case you still did not catch the very basic essence of this experiment and the horrors blind belief in authority does... NOT ONE participant categorically REFUSED to Harm another human  because the \"authority\" asked them to. They ALL went along with it, some more than others.\nThis blind belief in authority is one half of the equation... the other is the importance of Morality in a person's Life, and why, when it is lacking, people will do anything and justify it.\n#milgramexperiment #psychology #morality #orderfollower #authority #donotcomply #justsayno #history","NumberOfLikes":6,"Hashtags":["#milgramexperiment","#psychology","#morality","#orderfollower","#authority","#donotcomply","#justsayno","#history"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598148030,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 04:00:30 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Because I have nothing better to do!

I had a good laugh about it then, but the question has stayed with me. While I didn\u2019t get into trouble, of course, I do wonder how long I will keep it this way. And the answer, like so many answers these days, is that I just don\u2019t know.\n.\nThe easy explanation as to why I did it is simple \u2013 why not? Nothing else makes sense right now\u2026might as well have purple and pink hair. A slightly more honest answer is that as my gray roots really started to make themselves SEEN and KNOWN they were not doing much for my brown ends. The colors were simply not getting along nicely. So, to stop the fight between brown and gray I introduced pink and purple and there has been much more hair harmony since then.\n.\nI have returned to the hair salon for cuts \u2013 I\u2019ve been twice now \u2013 but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever go back to younger-me-brunette. The gray is slowly taking over and the pink and purple are both temporary colors that slowly wash out and have to be refreshed every couple of weeks. So, someday I\u2019ll probably stop with the pink and purple and get a full-on view of the gray. A \u201Cnew me\u201D in the \u201Cnew world\u201D I\u2019m kinda excited about it, to be honest.\n.\nBut right now I like having purple and pink hair. It makes me smile. Plus, I\u2019ll always know what pictures were taken during the pandemic. And, instead of everything just FEELING different, I actually LOOK different. It feels right right now.\n.\nHope you are doing something that a five-year-old might think you\u2019d get into trouble for, but you\u2019re just doing because it makes you feel like you are doing *something* in a world where there is currently so much we can\u2019t do. Thankfully, we can get out and tour again. Let me know if you\u2019d like to!
