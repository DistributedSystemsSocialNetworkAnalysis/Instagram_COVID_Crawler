The first of these, he said, is to \u201Creposition the institution as a scholarly community that is involved in the production of original knowledge and storytelling of all kinds.\u201D\n\nDue to the global move to online learning, a transition Kraidy believes is accelerated but not ignited by Covid-19, Northwestern Qatar is able to continue distinguishing itself in this online environment by \u201Cfocusing on what we do best, taking advantage of our location, and becoming more visible as a node for creating new knowledge and new stories.\u201D\n\nThe importance of shared governance was the subject of Kraidy\u2019s second strategic priority, which he defined as a \u201Cself-governing faculty that abide by a set of academic values and professional norms that are then translated into processes and procedures that are both clearly spelled out and equitable.\u201D His third priority, relates to \u201Cfaculty hiring, nurturing, promotion, and retention,\u201D which he said is \u201Ca fundamental aspect of everything that we do and has to correspond to our mission.\u201D The fourth and final priority addressed \u201Ca programme and agenda of research where everybody becomes known for a few fundamental questions and a variety of studies around them.\u201D\n.\n.\n.\n.\n@nuqatar #northwestern #university #qatar #life #students #studentlife #academics #academicyear #corona #covid19 #pandemic #uni #university #doha #qatar","NumberOfLikes":2,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Community on August 22, 2020.

And made myself really prepared for this new Change I read so much about Spirituality, Mythology and started concentrating only towards positivity spreading love. Life's too short to hold grudges.
