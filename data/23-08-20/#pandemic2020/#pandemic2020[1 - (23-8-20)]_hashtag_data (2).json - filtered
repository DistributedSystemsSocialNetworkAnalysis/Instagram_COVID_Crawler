We are here today.  Gone tomorrow. \n\nI do not know my friend well and long enough, and yet, I do.  I know her more in the way she comes alive in the stories of my friend, Tess.\n\nPeople will pray for the family, messages will be sent, hugs will be given, a lot of love will be going around. I know none of these and even all of them combined will ever be enough, but maybe for now it\u2019s how they \u2014 her husband, daughter, sons and all those Virginia left behind --- will be able to get through the coming weeks.\n\nAs for my questions -  I have no answers. And maybe all I need to understand is that there is no answer to these situations.  All we can do is trust that God is sovereign, He holds our life, He is in control and that He loves us.❤️\n\n#reflections #death #funeral #covidcomplication #deathcomeslikeathiefinthenight #coviddeath #pandemic2020 #friends #relationship #pinay #Filipina #pinaynurse","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#reflections","#death","#funeral","#covidcomplication","#deathcomeslikeathiefinthenight","#coviddeath","#pandemic2020","#friends","#relationship","#pinay","#Filipina","#pinaynurse"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Jescel on August 23, 2020.

I'm happy to do so in public to protect other people.. BUT There has been a running theme this year with breathing, from bushfires to George Floyd. Speaking the truth against all odds. Throat chakra. The feeling of witch hunts again. Everyone's eyes are sexier but I really miss seeing their mouths. I am not into fetishizing face masks at all. I am into the extra piercing eye contact. I am into the fact that the coal industry seems to be falling because of the pandemic. I am also into the fact that perhaps this year will mean the end of discrimination against our Muslim community in Australia. Solidarity. This is not an opinion anyone needs to share with me. Perhaps it is time to leave behind these social constructs of who can do what and why that makes it okay. The policing of each other must stop.

More importantly, the character growth I've seen in him since this pandemic began makes me confident that he will overcome every challenge that comes his way.\n\nMy heart goes out to all the parents, guardians, teachers, and school administrators. We are all trying to make the best choices for our families when there are none. Some of us *barely* scraped through the end of last year. But we did it!

I hope it's the same with people in other countries as well,  we cannot fear the virus anymore and stay locked up in our houses , as this is not ending any day soon. \n\nSo it's important that we take care of ourselves as much as we can , beginning from wearing masks to sanitizing our hands. Also it's important to eat healthy food , vegetables and food rich in vitamin C to boost our immunity . Stay away from unhealthy food and try to cook as much as you can at home and carry it to work. \n\nStaying away from parties or crowded places should be kept in mind always. \n\nAs I don't work in a hospital or not looking after Covid patients , so I am using reusable cloth masks , you can make them at home or buy them based on your need. They are much more sustainable and economical. \n\nSo if you guys are interested in mask reviews ,comment down below and I will show some of the cloth masks that I am using during this pandemic and share my experience . \n\n#wearyourmask #pandemic2020 #stayhome #staysafe #eatvitaminceveryday #boostyourimmunity #wearclothmasks #savetheoceans #sustainableliving","NumberOfLikes":17,"Hashtags":["#wearyourmask","#pandemic2020","#stayhome","#staysafe","#eatvitaminceveryday","#boostyourimmunity","#wearclothmasks","#savetheoceans","#sustainableliving"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Tripti Mukherjee on August 22, 2020.

This entire year has both flown by and remained frozen at the same time. This morning I was thinking about how I never in my wildest dreams would think we would have to live our daily lives wearing face masks and living in constant fear. I rarely leave my house anyway,  but there is a difference between it being my choice to stay isolated and being forced to be. For those with debilating mental illness this swift change of life has been even more difficult. \n💊\nBeing dumped by the love of my life of 18 years in 2014, losing my career of 10 years in 2016, losing all the friends that I made there, becoming disabled due to mental illness, a suicide attempt\/hospitalization last October, and then my dad passing away last November after a 2 year battle with cancer has been overwhelming to say the least. I've dealt with all of that, by hiding in my room. The fear of ever getting too close to anyone ever again, is so strong, that I would rather spend the rest of my days alone than ever allow myself to be hurt like that ever again. \n🏡\nI'm lonely sometimes, and wish I still had parties with friends, someone to share my experiences with, or even someplace to go when I need a change of scenery, but my peace of mind is worth more.  Parasocial relationships are the way of the future, I feel safe there.  #summer #dogdaysofsummer #pandemiclife \n.\n.\n.\n.\n#mentalhealth #coronavirus #lifestyle #friendship #loss #cancer #death #fired #divorce #heartbroken #disabled #disability #isolation #Depresion #bipolar #fear #pain #cutslikeaknife #sadness #relationships #familyovereverything #hurt #storytime #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife","NumberOfLikes":7,"Hashtags":["#summer","#dogdaysofsummer","#pandemiclife","#mentalhealth","#coronavirus","#lifestyle","#friendship","#loss","#cancer","#death","#fired","#divorce","#heartbroken","#disabled","#disability","#isolation","#Depresion","#bipolar","#fear","#pain","#cutslikeaknife","#sadness","#relationships","#familyovereverything","#hurt","#storytime","#pandemic2020","#pandemiclife"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1598150808,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 04:46:48 CEST 2020","Location":"Chesterfield County, Virginia"},{"Owner":"4624lagunas","CaptionText":"For everyone days or night #covid19 #friends #family #ordernow #youandme #pandemic2020 $10.00  only  TextNow 😊","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#friends","#family","#ordernow","#youandme","#pandemic2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1598150752,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 04:45:52 CEST 2020","Location":"Atlanta, Georgia"},{"Owner":"keenanfloristmagelang","CaptionText":"Tuhkan.....mbaknya seneng😁😁😘\nTerimakasih sudah mempercayakan kepada kami @keenanfloristmagelang \n🙏🙏🙏\n\nFast respon 081578019011\n\n#magelanghits\n#buketbunga\n#buketbungamagelang\n#buketbungawisuda\n#buketmawarmagelang\n#mawarmerah\n#buketmawar\n#buketwisuda\n#pandemic2020\n#buketbungalamaran\n#engagement\n#lamaran\n#magelang","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#magelanghits","#buketbunga","#buketbungamagelang","#buketbungawisuda","#buketmawarmagelang","#mawarmerah","#buketmawar","#buketwisuda","#pandemic2020","#buketbungalamaran","#engagement","#lamaran","#magelang"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by karanganbungamagelang on August 22, 2020.

Remember when you could GO to the gym?? I have ALWAYS fought to keep the extra pounds away. Let\u2019s face it, I will NEVER be \u201Cskinny\u201D and im okay with that. \n\n✨ \n\nI finally realized that being healthy is so much more important than what that scale says. It wasn\u2019t until I found my tribe of bad ass ladies who helped me figure this all out ❤️. \n\n✨ \n\nMy motivation was SHOT!  Let\u2019s face it, it goes up and down especially with all this nonsense going on in the world. Im a mom, I work full time, commute to and from work, an hour each way. Look. Lets be real, if i had to choose between spending my time with my daughter or going to the gym, well...I\u2019d choose my daughter 10 times out of 10 lol. 😍😍. So of course, my fitness kept hanging out on the back burner. \n\n✨ \n\nI finally took a leap of faith and decided to start working out right where I was. At my own home. I started jumping into these challenge groups that my friend was always talking about. These women motivated each other. 👏🏼These women shared healthy recipes, sweaty pics of them working out right along side their kids. They held each other accountable!! THATS what i needed! 🙌🏼.\n\n✨\n\nI'm so grateful to have so much support from so many women who are just like me. #yourenotalone\n\nWe all need that group of people who cheer you on, even when you can\u2019t even cheer for yourself! And we all definitely deserve to feel like we have women in our corner. \n\n✨ \n\nGirl, its okay to put yourself first. Make yourself a priority 🙌🏼\n\nNext challenge group is coming up in a few weeks, I\u2019m so excited to jump back in!

Even though it is arrived the latest since 2005, the delay was not based on our own efforts but was forced by the disaster of coronavirus pandemic. It is nothing to be celebrated; instead, it is something to remind us : Do we want to be suppressed or do we want to decide on our own? Perhaps Earth Overshoot Day is not 100% precise or 100% reflecting the real situation, it definitely gives us an indication of how great impact we have over our environment. Check our profile to get the link to calculate your personal Overshoot Day! I am now wondering of your results! \n\n兩年前我們第一次認識了「地球超載日」（也是我們現在哀居的第一篇文），而今年因為肺炎的關係，許多國家都執行了大規模的封城、停工、跨國停飛，因此才又想起了超載日，很好奇今年的超載日是否真的會延後，而果不其然，今年數據蒐集下來計算過後，超載日整整比去年晚了三週，來到了2005年以來最晚的一次 - 8\/22！但這是建立在犧牲許多無辜生命、造成許多經濟困境、傷害許多人際感情的「進步」，而且這若只是被迫發生的單一事件，長期而言，我們仍會繼續與地球為敵、讓資源消耗殆盡。我們需要的真的比想像（被這個資本消費主義社會所建立起來的想像）還要少很多，我個人2018年的超載日是5\/29，若全世界照我那樣活則我們需要2.5顆地球，而今年計算出來則是2021\/3\/7，不僅不負債還能多存錢，若全世界照我這樣活則我們就只需要0.8顆地球！當然這只是非常簡易的計算，但至少確定的是，透過有意識地檢視自己的生活、認清自己的需要，我們是可以做出改變、產生影響的！我今年最大的改變就是不吃肉（蛋奶也很少量）、代步工具以腳踏車為主（荷蘭生活是主因，但回國後也因為總總因數我也開始願意頂著大太陽騎腳踏車了）、減少非常多廢棄物（主要是因為從源頭的消費減少，整體能製造的垃圾相對也絕對減少了）。這些改變在平常生活裡其實是覺得很微不足道的，但透過這樣的計算方式，突然那些改變變得很具體，所以真的要相信再小的舉動也是能累積、會有「複利」的力量的！推薦大家點擊我們首頁進去Global Footprint Network網站去計算自己的超載日～\n.\n.\n.\n#tracyandjos3minecoknowledge \n#earthovershootday2020 #earthovershootday #overshootday #ecologicaldeficit #ecologicalfootprint #biocapacity #ecologicalservices #ecologicalresources #regeneration #carbonfootprint #forestproduct #foodfootprint #covid19 #pandemic2020 #thriving #inequality #planet #population #food #energy #cities #urbanplannin #planetaryboundaries #sustainability #sustainabledevelopment #SDGs #MoveTheDate #地球超載日 #永續發展","NumberOfLikes":51,"Hashtags":["#tracyandjos3minecoknowledge","#earthovershootday2020","#earthovershootday","#overshootday","#ecologicaldeficit","#ecologicalfootprint","#biocapacity","#ecologicalservices","#ecologicalresources","#regeneration","#carbonfootprint","#forestproduct","#foodfootprint","#covid19","#pandemic2020","#thriving","#inequality","#planet","#population","#food","#energy","#cities","#urbanplannin","#planetaryboundaries","#sustainability","#sustainabledevelopment","#SDGs","#MoveTheDate","#地球超載日","#永續發展"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1598082470,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 09:47:50 CEST 2020","Location":"Mother Earth"},{"Owner":"nyakdien_official","CaptionText":"Mengapa Berapa orang beranggalan bahwa Orcha outer Lebih Nyaman digunakan KARNA, Orcha Outer di disain khusus dengan menimbangkan banyak hal yang bersangkutan dengan medis, \n1.

I was totally #burnedout #depressed and #sleepdeprived because I was a mom of thousand trades while hubby was making the dough in South-Korea for 3-5 weeks at a time. \u201CStaying with it\u201D is an overestimation. I was run down. I felt like a train ran over me every single day- yet I kept on surviving. \n...\nI was also healing from a bilateral plantar fasciitis and had 4 months to train for my first #olympicdistancetriathlon ... i only had a mountain bike, didn\u2019t have any idea about swim workouts and could only run 20mins at a time. \n...\nYet I kept dreaming about \u201Cdoing\u201D the triathlon. It gave me a challenge, a purpose, a goal and a dream to reach for all in one. \n..\nWhen the day came, it was a balmy foggy day, +9c with windchill but I didn\u2019t care. I was loving every minute! \n..\nI swam 1500m in about 33mins, biked 44km in 1:37hrs:mins and ran 10k in about 52mins. I took my time in transitions, changing my clothes(!), had an amazing borrowed bike, and had no idea how to pace a 44k. My time was nothing spectacular but I was completely in love. I kept thinking to myself \u201CThis is the most fun I\u2019ve done in years!\u201D. When can I do this again? \n..\n5 years forward and I am still very much in love. My goals have grown from \u201Cdoing\u201D a triathlon to qualifying and racing at Ironman World Championships in Kona. The purpose if the same: to find the physical and mental limits of my body and mind while enjoying the sport and embracing the challenge. \n..\n#covid19 has changed a few things and one of them is that I am now coaching myself (yikes!!). I have huge appreciation for @elementsportscoaching for the last two years and for whipping me into a  immensely more confident and fitter athlete! I feel a bit like a teenager leaving home: a bit scared but confident in my own abilities and super excited for the new adventures ahead! \n...\n#onwardsandupwards despite #pandemic2020 \n...","NumberOfLikes":27,"Hashtags":["#throwbacksaturday","#triahlon","#burnedout","#depressed","#sleepdeprived","#olympicdistancetriathlon","#covid19","#onwardsandupwards","#pandemic2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Marjaana in Rotary Sunshine Park.

The majority of recently produced masks will not block a virus the size of a corona variety - you should not be sneezing, coughing, or spitting on a room to begin with (!). Covid-19 has killed many, I will never deny that it has been dangerous to an extent- but the mortality rate is astonishingly lower than the common flu. The rumor in Interior Alaska is that we had the virus during our normal flu season, and nobody noticed the difference. Masks are a symbol of shame and fear throughout history, and, right now, are proof that the American people are willing to let mass media make crucial decisions for them. Stop the fear. Save our jobs and our businesses. Stop teaching our children to let the newscasters speak for the nation. #mediapandemic #covid19 #covid_19 #covid #covidusa #alaska #fairbanksalaska #covidak #covidalaska #mask #maskfashion #pandemic #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife #antimask #covidmemes #covidmeme #covidmasks #plaguemask #school #school2020 #university #college #freedomofspeech","NumberOfLikes":2,"Hashtags":["#mediapandemic","#covid19","#covid_19","#covid","#covidusa","#alaska","#fairbanksalaska","#covidak","#covidalaska","#mask","#maskfashion","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#pandemiclife","#antimask","#covidmemes","#covidmeme","#covidmasks","#plaguemask","#school","#school2020","#university","#college","#freedomofspeech"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by A.
