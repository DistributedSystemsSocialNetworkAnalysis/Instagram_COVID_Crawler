For today\u2019s stop on my pandemic Hollywood tour I thought it would be fun to visit the home that they used as Bette Davis\u2019 home on this successful Ryan Murphy production! \n\nThis critically acclaimed series chronicled the rivalry between legendary Hollywood actresses Joan Crawford and Bette Davis during and after the production of their 1962 psychological horror thriller film \u201CWhat Ever Happened to Baby Jane?\u201D Jessica Lange and Susan Sarandon star as Crawford and Davis, respectively.\n\nBette Davis\u2019 house from \u201CFeud\u201D is located at 2720 Monte Mar Terrace in the posh Cheviot Hills area of Los Angeles. The massive estate, built in 1926, boasts 7 bedrooms, 7 baths, 5,436 square feet of living space. Please note that this is a private residence so if you visit please do not trespass or disturb the people that live there.\n\nDuring her lifetime and ever since, Davis is considered one of Hollywood's finest actresses. Ferociously talented and ambitious, she won two Oscars for Best Actress ¬†(she won for 1935\u2019s \u201CDangerous\u201D and 1938\u2019s \u201CJezebel\u201C) and was nominated a total of ten times. \n\nFun facts - This gorgeous Tudor style house was once owned by actress Agnes Moorhead (Endora from the classic TV show \u201CBewitched\u201D) from 1946 to 1953. The home was also used as the home to Gretchen\u2019s (Kaley Cuoco) family in the 2016 comedy film \u201CThe Wedding Ringer\u201D. ¬†\n\nSusan Sarandon claimed that she never met the real Bette Davis, but that during the 1980s Davis got word to Sarandon through a mutual acquaintance that she was her actress of choice to play her in a bio-pic. Sarandon was interested, but it was never followed-up on and the two women didn't have any correspondence.\n\nDavis received her final Academy Award nomination for her role as demented Baby Jane Hudson in \u201CWhat Ever Happened to Baby Jane?\u201D Due, in part, to Crawford\u2019s scheming efforts! #filminglocation #feudbetteandjoan #bettedavis #susansarandon #hollywoodtour #pandemic2020 #socialdistancing #wearamask #tonymiros","NumberOfLikes":30,"Hashtags":["#filminglocation","#feudbetteandjoan","#bettedavis","#susansarandon","#hollywoodtour","#pandemic2020","#socialdistancing","#wearamask","#tonymiros"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1598125463,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 21:44:23 CEST 2020","Location":"Cheviot Hills, Los Angeles"},{"CaptionText":"Magic Luxury Occasions Event Facility LLC \n#shopping #popupshopstl #shopismycardio #ladiesnightoutüíÉ #pandemic2020 #atlbraids #upscalevendor #lenoxmall #phippsmansion #gucci #fendi #louisvuitton #prada #nike #reebok #airjordan1 #fashionnovacurve #whoruntheworldgirls #musicfun #bookmyspace #reserved #reservenow\u203CÔ∏è #holidayweekend #birthdayweek #anniversarycakes","NumberOfLikes":1,"Hashtags":["#shopping","#popupshopstl","#shopismycardio","#ladiesnightoutüíÉ","#pandemic2020","#atlbraids","#upscalevendor","#lenoxmall","#phippsmansion","#gucci","#fendi","#louisvuitton","#prada","#nike","#reebok","#airjordan1","#fashionnovacurve","#whoruntheworldgirls","#musicfun","#bookmyspace","#reserved","#reservenow\u203CÔ∏è","#holidayweekend","#birthdayweek","#anniversarycakes"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by MüíéLüíéO in Magic Luxury Occasions.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598125333,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 21:42:13 CEST 2020","Location":"Magic Luxury Occasions"},{"CaptionText":"#positiveaffirmations #affirmations #dailyaffirmations #positivevibes #positivetalk #positivemindset #positivequotes #yourdoinggreat #justbreathe #youareenough #youaremorethanenough #youarenotalone #youareworthy #nevergiveup #nevergiveupüí™ #alwayskeepfighting #mentalhealthquotes #mentalhealthmatters #mentalillnessawareness #youareasuperhero #superman #wonderman #thereishope #depressionawareness #ptsdawareness #anxietyawareness #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife #quarantinememes #quarantinelife","NumberOfLikes":1,"Hashtags":["#positiveaffirmations","#affirmations","#dailyaffirmations","#positivevibes","#positivetalk","#positivemindset","#positivequotes","#yourdoinggreat","#justbreathe","#youareenough","#youaremorethanenough","#youarenotalone","#youareworthy","#nevergiveup","#nevergiveupüí™","#alwayskeepfighting","#mentalhealthquotes","#mentalhealthmatters","#mentalillnessawareness","#youareasuperhero","#superman","#wonderman","#thereishope","#depressionawareness","#ptsdawareness","#anxietyawareness","#pandemic2020","#pandemiclife","#quarantinememes","#quarantinelife"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598125248,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 21:40:48 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Must not go to park in pandemic time ‚ùå\nSakarya 2020\n.\n.\n#filmissurvive#filmisalive#analogphotography#analogfilm#analogvibes#filmisnotdead#keepfilmalive#saveonfilm#analogue_people #analogphotographer #35mmfilmphotography#corona #coronavirus #pandemic2020 #pandemic „Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§","NumberOfLikes":10,"Hashtags":["#filmissurviv","#filmisaliv","#analogphotograph","#analogfil","#analogvibe","#filmisnotdea","#keepfilmaliv","#saveonfil","#analogue_people","#analogphotographer","#35mmfilmphotograph","#corona","#coronavirus","#pandemic2020","#pandemic"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @filmisalive.i on August 22, 2020.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598124816,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 21:33:36 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Relief at last. Here is my mom and public health PSA: COVID life is hard. Giving up life as we know it almost overnight was scary. Yes, it is uncomfortable to wear a mask all the time. Yes, it can feel hard to breathe with a mask on. Yes, it's depressing not to see your friends, family, or be together at church, school, extracurricular activities or work. Yes, getting tested isn't comfortable. Yes, it's time consuming to watch your hands and sanitize everything. I hear the complaints and acknowledge that they are real.\n\nUnfortunately for everyone on this planet, life did not agree that things would be easy. There was no contract that we signed with reality that said \"when the going gets tough, this pandemic will just ease up because we know it's hard and you've earned it.\" All of those cons I mentioned above are things that make us uncomfortable. We have control over our comfort and you can do things to make the cons easier to manage and tolerate. \n\nI'm working on mask wearing with my 2 year old but she has trouble understanding it and it's going to take time. We don't leave the house at all other than for food, work, a walk outside, and school, and we've still been exposed directly to COVID multiple times. Wear your mask for her. Wear it for others who legit can't. Just because it's been 6 months and you're tired doesn't mean it's time to wrap up out efforts to slow the spread. The young and immune compromised are depending on you. Wear a mask, stay distant, WASH YOUR HANDS, get a flu shot, cough in your elbow, stay home when you are sick, limit contacts, get tested when you are feeling symptomatic or exposed, do all the things you know need to be done. We are all humans inhabiting this planet together. Do your small part, even if it's uncomfortable for you.

These particles¬†\u201Cshow a more violent climbing tendency. The climbing speed is much faster than toilet flushing,\u201D explained Liu.\n\nSince urinals are more frequently used in densely populated areas, it can pose a serious health challenge.\n\n\u201CWearing a mask should be mandatory within public restrooms during the pandemic, and anti-diffusion improvements are urgently needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19,\u201D Liu added.\n\nEarlier, researchers of fluids at the same university had recommended closing the lid on toilets before flushing to prevent the spread of aerosols.

At the very end, he told the most impactful story.  One I hadn\u2019t heard before.  I saved the clip and have listened to it a few times since.  It is so profound, I decided to share it here.\n\nHere is my re-telling if the story:\n\nA man was in his garden where he noticed a butterfly struggling to emerge from its cocoon.  He watched as it worked a small hole into the cocoon with its legs but that hole was not big enough for its body to fit through.  It struggled for some time and then went completely still, seemingly exhausted.\nü¶ã\nWanting to help, the old man decided to open the hole in the cocoon up larger.  The butterfly was able to emerge but instead of flying away, it fell to the ground. \nü¶ã\nWhat the man didn\u2019t know was that the effort required to emerge from a cocoon is nature\u2019s way of strengthening the butterfly\u2019s wings and preparing it to fly. \nü¶ã\nI love this reminder that sometimes we have to struggle and trudge uphill through hardship in order to reach our destiny.  Often, the extra effort required to overcome obstacles is what prepares us for navigating life\u2019s challenges.\nü¶ã\nLooking back on the past 6 months after hearing this story, I started to reframe the narrative in my head.  The obstacles of #covid19 and decreased work hours and home school and cancelled plans are the expert\u2019s course in overcoming challenges.  I am looking forward to breaking free from this cocoon and flying high! \n.\n.\n#jasminestarr #jasminestarpodcast #kencolemanshow #lessonofthebutterfly #pandemic2020 #covid19 #coronahomeschool #virtuallearning #virtuallearning2020 #overcomingobstacles #challenge #motivation #inspiration","NumberOfLikes":20,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#jasminestarr","#jasminestarpodcast","#kencolemanshow","#lessonofthebutterfly","#pandemic2020","#covid19","#coronahomeschool","#virtuallearning","#virtuallearning2020","#overcomingobstacles","#challenge","#motivation","#inspiration"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Dr. Anne Sharkey in Leander, Texas.

My eyes were opened spiritually and mentally to this pathway, in a time when I was ready for it.\nToday I am more grateful for every day chores, for the rain that falls and I can stay at home being dry and warm. To the gentle breeze in the trees and being able to fall asleep when mind and body are tired. Every day is a gift, I had forgotten. Thank you for life and every day life!\n.\n#summer2020 #sommar2020 #pandemic2020 #pandemi2020 #life #grateful #tacksam #g√•va #livet #2020ÎÖÑ #Ïó¨Î¶Ñ #lifeisgood2020","NumberOfLikes":9,"Hashtags":["#summer2020","#sommar2020","#pandemic2020","#pandemi2020","#life","#grateful","#tacksam","#g√•va","#livet","#2020ÎÖÑ","#Ïó¨Î¶Ñ","#lifeisgood2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Ledarskap i Norr on August 22, 2020.

The first time I saw Calgary it was a ghost town. When my eyes met Banff, the gates were closed. No longer was the world open with possibilities, it was asking us to hunker down. \n\nThe strange thing is, I\u2019ve done this before. I\u2019ve been in recovery from illnesses that took months. It asked me to stay still. Even on days I felt I could expand, I stayed still to heal. \n\nCase numbers are going up, and I\u2019m staying still. Waiting. Preserving. Because anyone with a compromised immune system knows that viruses have no mercy on people like us. \n\nI\u2019m again reminded, of the underground city that lies below Edinburgh. There was a figure in black, a mask with a beak. He stood over a woman holding her child in a cramped room. Her eyes, as if it was the end. \n\nThe guide said death was a part of life when the plague came. Death is a part of any lifetime. Inevitable in all its form. Embedded in the strings of life. \n\nMuch like life in the underground city, I hung the laundry on the banister, strung up like a line of flags charting the way. \n\nBecause when all is said and done, it\u2019s these simple moments of life that we will remember. \n\nThe little things that made life feel okay, when the world felt dark.","NumberOfLikes":16,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Bethany Jane on August 22, 2020.

Long story short, they've taken secondhand snorkels and created PAPRs (Powered Air Purifying Respirator) - and they're extremely effective! Those interested in the fine print, read on!\n...................\n\nHi Jo and Christey! So we had some key updates on our ventilator project.\n\nBased on demand, supply shortages and our research we adapted the project in a very unique manner. \n\nWe created PAPRs using snorkelling masks which can double as a full face respirator for frontliners which can easily replace their face mask, face shield with this reusable less wasteful and significantly better solution. Additionally the PAPR also doubles up as a ventilator mask which can be retrofitted to any CPAP or BiPAP machine commonly available to provide clean breathing support without having any chance any of the risks of the ambubag type we initially had. \n\nThe design already has FDA emergency approval and is being used around the world. We adopted it in Bangladesh and customized it based on our own needs here. \n\nWe are here and being able to support frontliners like never before because of all the funding we received for you guys. So now our ventilator project doubles up as PPE project for doctors too! We are just too excited to share this amazing news with you guys. \n\nwww.justpeoples.org\/covid-19\n\n#JPprojectleaders #localheroes #localleaders #bestinthefield #supportingthemostvulnerable #covidresponse\n #justpeoples #soimpressive #bangladesh #dogoodfeelgood  #grassroots #projectleader  #givingback #makeadifference #grassrootssolutions #localchange #globalcooperationforsolutions #backinglocalchange #DonatetoSaveLives  #JPCovid19Response \n#3dprinting #snorkel #upcycled #PAPR\n#covid19 #pandemic2020 #flattenthecurve #savelives  #faceshields #PPE","NumberOfLikes":12,"Hashtags":["#JPprojectleaders","#localheroes","#localleaders","#bestinthefield","#supportingthemostvulnerable","#covidresponse","#justpeoples","#soimpressive","#bangladesh","#dogoodfeelgood","#grassroots","#projectleader","#givingback","#makeadifference","#grassrootssolutions","#localchange","#globalcooperationforsolutions","#backinglocalchange","#DonatetoSaveLives","#JPCovid19Response","#3dprinting","#snorkel","#upcycled","#PAPR","#covid19","#pandemic2020","#flattenthecurve","#savelives","#faceshields","#PPE"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Just Peoples on August 21, 2020.","NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598072454,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 07:00:54 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Di masa pandemi seperti ini sebaiknya kita selalu membawa perlengkapan sholat pribadi kemanapun pergi. \n\nSusah mencari mukena yang bahannya nyaman, ringan, pouch kecil dan tetap menutup aurat dengan sempurna tanpa takut tersingkap?

Designed by local architect Lester S. Moore in 1911, McDaniel purchased her white, two-story, seventeen-room house in 1942.\n\nPlease note that this is a private residence so if you visit please do not trespass or disturb the people that live there.\n\nMcDaniel was known for her huge Hollywood soirees, which brought black and white celebrities to Sugar Hill. White actors including Agnes Moorehead, Esther Williams, and her beloved co-star Clark Gable attended the bashes, which were covered by attending gossip columnists like Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons.\n\nMcDaniel also played a pivotal role in desegregating housing in Los Angeles. In 1949, white residents filed a lawsuit against McDaniel and other black homeowners in the Sugar Hill neighborhood because their property deeds forbade sale to non-Caucasians.\n\nMcDaniel held meetings at her home and organizing around 30 black neighbors, including blues and jazz singer Ethel Waters and actress Louise Beavers, to fight the suit in court.\n\nIn the end, the judge ruled in favor of McDaniel and other black homeowners on the grounds of the 14th Amendment - which prohibits depriving individuals of life, freedom, and property without due process of law. \n\nOn New Year\u2019s Eve 1950, an aging McDaniel held one final bash, a \u201Chouse cooling,\u201D before she moved into a more manageable one-story home on Country Club Drive. She died of breast cancer at age 59 in 1952. #hattiemcdaniel #trailblazer #westadamsheights #hollywoodtour #pandemic2020 #socialdistancing #wearamask #tonymiros","NumberOfLikes":44,"Hashtags":["#hattiemcdaniel","#trailblazer","#westadamsheights","#hollywoodtour","#pandemic2020","#socialdistancing","#wearamask","#tonymiros"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":11,"Timestamp":1598030912,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 19:28:32 CEST 2020","Location":"West Adams Historic District"},{"CaptionText":"\u201CWhat is that feeling when you\u2019re driving away from people and they recede on the plain till you see their specks dispersing? \u2014 it\u2019s the too-huge world vaulting us, and it\u2019s good-bye.

Menstruation is one of the topics but we need to consider also pregnant ladies, babies, singles ladies with kids and elder people. \n\n@menstruationis.asacredright needs more donations to continue to buy menstrual pads. And hopefully inspire more people to take action to help others. Due the uncertain visa situation, our aim is to continue until we can, and hopefully evolve in the future soon.\n\nIn Koh Phangan we have around 600 people who came from Myanmar looking for job and better conditions in these touristic island. Since the lockdown many burmese and locals lost their job and source of income.  Less and less people on the island, and more people are in need.\n\nOnly in Haad Rin area we have around 150 menstruating ladies, 25 babies and 6 pregnant. 11 babies under Naan Formula (very expensive product), and a new born baby with mother not healthy due lack of food.  Next month we have a new baby arriving, and if the mother needs any kind of assistance, there's no free health service available for non thai people. \n\nThis is the situation only one area of Koh Phangan. Not all the burmeses people were counted and we should also include in those numbers all the thai people which are also suffering with this pandemic situation. It's hard, it's sad and it's going to get worst.
