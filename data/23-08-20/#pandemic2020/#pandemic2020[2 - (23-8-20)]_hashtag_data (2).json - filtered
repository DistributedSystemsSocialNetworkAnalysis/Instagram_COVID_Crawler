Different fro the rest. These last 4 months, we experienced something similar in different conditions. It was not easy for anyone. It was not easy for me too. I, Pamela, am a stay at home mom. Being a homemaker, I work 24x7, protecting, nurturing, sharing, caring, loving, organising,  updating, managing, tolerating, compromising in all possible ways for my Child and my family. No I am not whining. Never as I am proud of my choices. But I did all that. \n\nIn Pandemic things weren't much different, only that my habits and routines were challenged a bit more. Initially without the helping hand, cleaning utensils was a bit of an ordeal, more due to my childhood fungal allergy on my palms for which doctors prescribed less usage of detergents. But then thats one thing i have to touch to sanitise right!!! Cooking was never an ordeal to me rather I enjoyed a lot truly. Creating different difficult dish made me thrilled. \n\nAn important change out of all came with my son. No schools only online classes. And to top it, I have to take care of his maths practises too. Trust me, Maths and I dont gel well. Those equations scare me. Rik is a very adaptive child,  touchwood. Still gradually he started missing his friends,  his classroom, teachers, school bell, Tiffin break, school bus ride and even his Maths Sir. And even if my husband and I get to go out for groceries, he had no other option than to be stuck within the four walls. \n\nAnd the most annoying part is, he completely started depending on the IPad and PS4. And I couldn't really blame him too. But things started changing with relaxed lockdowns. Friends from the locality started mingling in a healthy way. To see my boy smile and play - that gave me an internal peace and joy. \n\nAm sure many of you can resonate with me!!! \n\n#musings #mothertales #mommytales #momknowsbest #lifeofachild #pandemic #covid19 #pandemic #pandemic2020 #deardiary #lifeinpandemic #newnormal #mls #MakeoverLifestyleStories #improvandexplore #pamelasarkar","NumberOfLikes":32,"Hashtags":["#musings","#mothertales","#mommytales","#momknowsbest","#lifeofachild","#pandemic","#covid19","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#deardiary","#lifeinpandemic","#newnormal","#mls","#MakeoverLifestyleStories","#improvandexplore","#pamelasarkar"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Makeover, Lifestyle, Stories on August 21, 2020 tagging @pamela.sarkar84.

That really gave me a wake up call, and I wanted to share the photos above for you to see that depending on how I move & pose, the shape of my body changes. Arms get thicker, my tummy sticks out... I would also like to remind you that you should avoid comparing yourself to bodies that you see on social media. Many photos are heavily edited to the point that makes the individual look like 10kgs lighter overnight. \nI see it all the time on profiles I follow. Some are celebs, some are influencers and some are people  that I know in real life. Some edits are beyond obvious, but some are hard to spot. üïµüèº \nSo don\u2019t compare yourself to other bodies and feel miserable. Start loving and taking care of your own. ü§ó I am also aware that some people work their asses off to be fit and strong, and that is awesome! Those people inspire me! I admire them. ‚≠êÔ∏è \nHere is my story ‚¨áÔ∏è\nI have always been a relatively healthy and active person. I\u2019ve done swimming, spinning, boxing, dancing, running, CrossFit, yoga, HIIT workouts... you name it! And I still workout to this day. But after I turned 18 I\u2019ve struggled with my weight for years for many reasons. From 58kg, I went up to 85kg. That\u2019s when my cardiologist warned me about the dangers of being overweight. I then went on a healthy, balanced diet and worked out almost every day. Dropped 20kgs. Gained 9 kgs. Lost 6 kgs. I was going crazy. With the beginning of a global pandemic and gyms closing down, I found a way to workout at home. However, depending on the week, I still noticed that I \u201Cyo-yo\u201D on my weight, which made me frustrated and sad. But recently,  I started to truly love my body and quit comparing myself to other bodies on social media. I relaxed and accepted the fact that I am on my own fitness journey. And I will achieve MY goals. On my own time. üí™üèºü•ä üèÉüèº\u200D‚ôÄÔ∏èüßòüèº\u200D‚ôÄÔ∏èüèãüèº\u200D‚ôÄÔ∏è. \n\u201CWorkout because you love your body, not because you hate it.\u201D\nSending lots of love, health and happiness to all of you! stay safe! x ‚ô•Ô∏è","NumberOfLikes":125,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":23,"Timestamp":1598042942,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 22:49:02 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"illogical_insaan","CaptionText":"Putin be mastermind\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#memesüòÇ #dankmemes #memesdaily #dankmemesdaily #russianmemes #slavmemes #sovietmemes #sovietunion #blyat #gulag #putinmemes #quarantinememes #pandemic2020 #indianmemes #americanmemes ##trumpmemes #donaldtrumpmemes #covid19","NumberOfLikes":63,"Hashtags":["#memesüòÇ","#dankmemes","#memesdaily","#dankmemesdaily","#russianmemes","#slavmemes","#sovietmemes","#sovietunion","#blyat","#gulag","#putinmemes","#quarantinememes","#pandemic2020","#indianmemes","#americanmemes","#trumpmemes","#donaldtrumpmemes","#covid19"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Kermit the Frog on August 21, 2020.

It can severely affect the heart, vessels, nerves, kidney, skin and brain. Studies have shown that SAR-CoV-2 can cause severe damage, even in patients with mild symptoms or those in recovery. Often this damage is detected very late or not at all. People recovering from symptoms noted trouble with concentration, confused thoughts, memory loss, loss of consciousness, seizures, loss of smell and taste, psychosis, anxiety, delirium, trouble focusing, etc. Researchers found that one-way COVID attacks the body is by causing inflammation and swelling of the brain. \n\nBecause of significant involvement of lungs (prolonged ventilators, tracheostomy and dyspnea), nerve damage, and nervous system dysfunction (encephalopathy, stroke, seizure, psychiatric changes, etc.) Cognitive, Speech, Language and Swallowing difficulties are observed in individuals positive with COVID-19. A Speech Language Pathologist (SLP) can help with the mentioned problems.\n\n‚≠êCOMMUNICATION: When on ventilator\/tracheostomy and individual is unble to voice,SLP can provide with alternative methods of communication. Some individuals post stroke\/encephalopathy have slurred speech (Dysarthria) or language difficulty (Aphasia) which requires help with communication and expression.\n\n‚≠êSWALLOWING: Breathing tube, vocal cord damage, fluids in lungs, in-coordination or weakness of throat and oral muscles can cause significant swallowing difficulties and requires prompt intervention by SLP.\n\n‚≠êCOGNITION: With cognitive functions (memory, problem solving, reasoning, attention etc) affected, a SLP can step in with strategies and early intervention.\n.\n.\n.\n#covid19 #covid19india #covid #coronavirus #pandemic #pandemic2020 #speechlanguagetherapy #speechtherapy #languagetherapy #swallowtherapy #dysphagiatherapy #slp #slpsofinstagram #speech #language #cognition #swallowing #aphasia #dysarthria #dysphagia #cognitiveimpairment #tracheostomy #ventilator #encephalopathy #memoryloss #lossoftasteandsmell #nervedamage #seizures #mumbai #fixmyspeech","NumberOfLikes":20,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#covid19india","#covid","#coronavirus","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#speechlanguagetherapy","#speechtherapy","#languagetherapy","#swallowtherapy","#dysphagiatherapy","#slp","#slpsofinstagram","#speech","#language","#cognition","#swallowing","#aphasia","#dysarthria","#dysphagia","#cognitiveimpairment","#tracheostomy","#ventilator","#encephalopathy","#memoryloss","#lossoftasteandsmell","#nervedamage","#seizures","#mumbai","#fixmyspeech"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by All About Speech Therapy in Mumbai, Maharashtra.

I told her yes I was.  She responded with \"Thank you for doing what you do\". To be totally honest I was a little stunned, I have had clients thank me for my work but never a complete stranger. \n\nüçç\n\nShe explained \"I am a hugger!  But now I am not allowed to hug my friends or even get close to them. The Huggers are struggling! You provide a safe touch based therapy when people aren't allowed to be touched and that is so healing for some of us\". üò± Holy Shirt I had never really thought of it that way. I am not a touchy feely person- I like my personal space, therefore this social distancing has not really been that challenging for me.  But for those of you that thrive on being around people and hugging them, laughing next to them, just in general being close then these last 7 months must have been hell. \n\nüçç\n\nSo here is a shout out to all you Huggers out there! You're doing great, you're time will come again, just hang in there.  If you have noticed you are struggling and need some touch therapy then consider booking an appointment for a massage, or a fascial, or even a hair appointment.  All of these will be a safe environment where you can talk and laugh and have some human contact with someone that isn't in your immediate household. \n\n#huggersarenotok #extrovertstruggles #struggleisreal #introvertstimetoshine #socialdistancing #needhumaninteraction #pandemic2020 #thenewnormal #hardchanges #massagetherapists #massagetherapy #essentialworkers #happymindhappybody #keeponkeepingon #thankyou #mentalhealthisimportanttoo #beapineapple","NumberOfLikes":21,"Hashtags":["#huggersarenotok","#extrovertstruggles","#struggleisreal","#introvertstimetoshine","#socialdistancing","#needhumaninteraction","#pandemic2020","#thenewnormal","#hardchanges","#massagetherapists","#massagetherapy","#essentialworkers","#happymindhappybody","#keeponkeepingon","#thankyou","#mentalhealthisimportanttoo","#beapineapple"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Greer Massage LLC in Safeway.

Their ability to celebrate is so limited this year due to Covid pandemic but they found a way to make it bright. They also made my heart full of joy to do a simple act for them. They didn\u2019t let the things they couldn\u2019t do stop them from finding a way to lift them up today and I believe it is the reason they have always found a way through no matter what challenges life throws their way along their journey. I grew up here in this home and it is part of my story no matter what road I travel or where I live and I feel blessed to have parents that keep finding their way, together.

Due to the dampness in air, the breeding of disease spreading germs, and mosquitoes gets on a roll.\n\n*Keep a watch on any kind of fever. Fever with sore throat can be influenza, fever with severe joint pains can be dengue, fever with diarrhoea can be leptospirosis. As you know, even for Corona, fever is an important sign.\n\n*Make sure you do not let any water get accumulated around your house, on the terrace, in empty pots or waste containers etc.  as they can facilitate mosquito reproduction.\n\n*Avoid drinking water from outside, carry your bottle of filtered water always while stepping out of home.\n\n*Avoid eating open food items, stale breads or sweets. Do not eat UNWASHED raw fruits and veggies.\n\n*Make sure you wash your hands ALWAYS before having your meals. Hand-washing is all the more important to prevent the spread of Coronavirus too!\n\n*Eye infections also spread in this season due to viral infections. Make sure your hands are clean to avoid any eye infections.\n\n*Seek immediate medical attention in case of any signs and symptoms of the mentioned diseases. Stay hydrated and keep working on building a strong immunity to give a tough fight to seasonal diseases:)\n\n#addhomoeopathy #immunesupport #immunesystem #immunebooster #healthylifestyle #healthyliving #healthiswealth #covid19 #pandemic2020 #monsoonseason #monsoonillnesses #doctorsofinstagram #stayfit #wellnessjourney #wellness #wellnessnotillness #hydrationiskey","NumberOfLikes":21,"Hashtags":["#addhomoeopathy","#immunesupport","#immunesystem","#immunebooster","#healthylifestyle","#healthyliving","#healthiswealth","#covid19","#pandemic2020","#monsoonseason","#monsoonillnesses","#doctorsofinstagram","#stayfit","#wellnessjourney","#wellness","#wellnessnotillness","#hydrationiskey"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Add-Homoeopathy on August 21, 2020.

I haven\u2019t been consistent because somebody or some animal is usually in need of ALL OF my time. \nI had to make a sacrifice somewhere because I crave working out. It gives me that wonderful release of endorphins. It makes me feel accomplished. It makes me feel strong and healthy and happy. I\u2019ve been ignoring my body\u2019s unhappiness in order to give to others. \n\nMy back has been sore from being unprotected from my weak core muscles, working nights and lifting patients. There is more to me that touches uncomfortably and gets in the way of other things. My body wants to run, wants to move. Wants to feel exerted. \nFarm work and riding and a leisurely bike ride aren\u2019t enough for me, I need that strenuous physical activity. \n\nSo last night instead of cooking a meal from scratch, I let the kids have Mr Noodles. And it\u2019s totally ok. ONCE IN AWHILE. \nEven with that, I didn\u2019t have time to change into workout clothes, put a bra on, warm up or cool down.

People felt less stressed, happier, & felt more inner peace. Physical health was overall better with 80% saying they suffered less from colds & flu, & headaches had eased. \nThis is really amazing results. As a Reiki practioner who daily practices self Reiki I am fully aware of its healing benefits, & reap the benefits, but to see the results in survey format, & in the midst of a global crisis is sheer testament to the wonder that is Reiki. Its really awesome to see Reiki benefits proven in this way.\nNever has the planet faced such a crisis, globally people are suffering both mentally & physically, self care has never been more important than it is now.\nI urge you all to consider Reiki....

We almost gave up as things started to get worse in the area, but knew in our hearts we couldn't until one day, LITERALLY the day our lives were threatened by the drug addicts at the mechanic shop, we finally captured her &\nfound her the greatest family ever @catladyrescue & her boyfriend Sylvestre.\nThis little Kitten wound up inspiring Minerva & her boyfriend  who had never fostered or adopted before to spend this year fostering & adopting out 13 cats, TNR 15 cats, & feeding 5-10 homeless cats every single day. I can't even explain the amount of joy in my heart knowing that this one angel inspired & brought about this much goodness. I truly hope this story inspires you to pay it forward as you never know how much you could be helping someone. \n.\n.\n Check out her Instagram to help this wonderful couple as they currently have one cat in need of serious medical attention & could really use some financial assistance during these tough times.

The estimate includes parents who have already left the workforce as well as those who are at risk of losing their jobs...\n\nSo-called shadow joblessness, defined as Americans who have stopped looking for work, spiked to 8 million at the peak of the pandemic, and remains 5 million above pre-crisis levels, according to Bloomberg Economics. School closures will continue to impact this number, especially the labor force participation rate for women, who generally take on a greater share of childcare obligations.\n\nBUT HERE IS WHAT YOU CAN DO\n\nIn order to stay afloat in these difficult times you have to be creative and passionate about generating extra income for you and your family...\n\nBelow we have a few resources and ideas that other parents and spouses are discovering and using to generate extra income from home during the pandemic...\n\nREFERRAL MARKETING\nThis is where companies pay you for referring client who signs up for their services...\n\nThe catch...you must sign up too, but its free!!!\n\nHere are our TOP 2.. \n\n1.

Meanwhile we continue to exploit and deplete our natural, spiritual and cultural capital. \n\n\u201CCapitalism\u201D has indeed lost its way. (I say that in quotes because it\u2019s more accurately Crony Capitalism.)\n\nApple has added $1 Trillion to its market cap in the last 5 months. This makes it higher than the GDP of 178 countries (including Canada).\n\nHow long can this go on for? Why are the politicians we elect so completely beholden to the bottom lines of the corporation? When will we wake up from all of this and develop a system that aligns with our purpose here on earth?\n\nA great reset is coming. The writing is on the wall. It\u2019s coming to America. The time to prepare is now. \n\nThings you can do:\n\nHonor spirit. \nEducate yourself. \nRest and reset the body. \nElevate your mindset. \nPut money into safe investments that will allow you to weather the storm. \n\nThe good news is after this we will have an opportunity to rebuild. To create a more beautiful world our hearts know is possible. \n\nThe leaders who have done the work will rise and the ones who\u2019s time has come will fall. \n\nI work with others to help them prepare financially, mentally, physically, emotionally and spiritually for the events that are due to unfold over the next several years.

Most people infected will experience a mild to moderate respiratory illness, whilst others will show no symptoms at all. However for some the effects are severe and longer lasting.\n\nTheir aim in this yoga programme is to play some role in aiding the process of recovery. By only requiring the use of mostly basic props and furniture, they have tried to make the poses as accessible as possible for everyone.\n\nThe programme was compiled thanks to advice and guidance from Abhijata Iyengar, Lois Steinberg, Gulnaaz Dashti, Stephanie Quirk, the IY(UK) Therapy Committee, IY(UK) teachers who have experienced the virus themselves, and decades of work by BKS Iyengar and Dr Geeta S. Iyengar in medical classes at RIMYI in Pune.\n\nSee the link in their bio to access the video and booklet, which are both freely available.
