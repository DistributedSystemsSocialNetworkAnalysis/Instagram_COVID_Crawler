Next week, I go back to #uofh. I think we were all wanting a super long break and we got it! 😁 But now I'm ready to have a sense of normalcy in my day. Back in my homeland, Honduras, my relatives have been in a strict quarantine since #covid19 entered their borders via Europe. They've had to adhere to rigid guidelines to prevent the spread of the virus. The majority of the sectors were shut down for months. They were only allowed to go out for essentials twice a month based on the last digit of their identification number. Police had  checkpoints throughout, no travel between cities and no violation of curfew was tolerated. The economy suffered tremendously like you'd expect in an underdeveloped nation. They're now in their stage 1 of reopening and international flights started landing yesterday. ♥️. Quarantine wise, we've had it good here in the States yet we complain to no end. This virus, like the flu, is here to stay. I was infected back in June with mild symptoms. The most irritating of those symptoms was loosing my sense of smell. Not tasting my coffee!

(Bless every single one of you - no matter what decision you made. Bless you!).⠀\n⠀\nOh. And on top of all of that you might be an infertile! What a time to be alive!⠀\n⠀\nMaybe your cycle was canceled after months or years of preparation. Maybe you\u2019re starting treatment and your partner can\u2019t be with you for procedures and appointments. Maybe you're starting your medication protocol for a medicated cycle, IUI or IVF and the drugs you're on are stealing your sanity and you can't get together with friends to take your mind off things. Maybe you\u2019re finally pregnant after years of trying and your partner isn\u2019t able to attend ultrasounds. Maybe you\u2019re precious babe is being carried by a surrogate and you can\u2019t be present for appointments. Maybe you've had a loss - a failed cycle, a chemical pregnancy, a miscarriage, a still birth - and you're unable to mourn the way you truly want to mourn.

I was not equipped to handle and did not prioritize money the way I should have. Sadly, despite these failures I was still way better off than most of my friends. I saw some really horrible decisions being made but they too had the mentality of \u201Cjust survive, you\u2019ll figure it out later.\u201D 😞\n.\nThat\u2019s sad.

She is on the spectrum, is highly sensory seeking, and suffers from adhd. She has taught me so much.\n\nI struggle most days to deal with her moods, behaviors, and idiosyncrasies . . . and then she bares her heart with her sweet moments, like when she sporadically decides it's a \"taking care of mommy\" night. Or her creative moments like the times when she is creating mini meals or full on birthday parties for her LOL dolls. I also adore the amazing bond she has with her sister.\n\nBut homeschooling this girl is hard, y'all. I am not patient and like all of you who are trying this, I worry that her needs will not be met. Some days it's hard to get her to do the work at all. But then there are the days like yesterday when she stayed focused on two pages worth of handwriting practice. It's in those moments that I feel like we're going to be okay.\n\nI also find that my child thrives in nature, so if you would like to learn how to use nature in your homeschooling, check out my latest blog post, which can be found in a link in my bio. Or, if you need general help with homeschooling your special needs child, I have a post filled with resources on that, too.\n\nWe can do hard things with trial and error, folks. And I do believe our efforts are building stronger bonds with our kids. \n\nI would love to hear about how you are incorporating nature into your homeschooling, or homeschooling your special needs child in a way that works better for you.","NumberOfLikes":39,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Toxin-free Living for Moms on August 20, 2020.

Meski pada praktiknya tetap saja tidak dapat dilakukan sesuai harapan. Warga masih butuh keluar dari rumah untuk melakukan rutinitasnya. Apalagi rutinitas yang menyangkut perekonomian rumah tangga, sulit sekali untuk dihentikan dan dialihkan pada hal lain. Tidak semua profesi dapat melakukan sistem WFH (Work From Home), sehingga menimbulkan kecemasan dan ketakutan pada kalangan tertentu.\n\nBukan hanya mengancam kesehatan fisik, Covid-19 juga serius mengancam kesehatan mental. Sebagai profesi yang menerapkan sistem WFH, guru yang harus melakukan pembelajaran daring tidak terkecuali mendapat ancaman stress yang cukup besar. Tuntutan yang banyak, sistem-sistem baru, dan media pembelajaran yang masih asing menuntut untuk dipelajari dalam waktu yang singkat, membuat guru kelelahan bukan hanya dalam hal fisik, tetapi juga psikis. Beban mengajar menjadi dua kali lipat karena membutuhkan kreativitas dan keterampilan-keterampilan baru.\n\nBukan hanya siswa yang kesulitan beradaptasi dengan sistem pendidikan baru ini, terlebih guru yang harus mempersiapkan dan mempelajari banyak hal secara tiba-tiba. Dibutuhkan perjuangan dan mental yang sehat untuk terus menjalani sistem baru ini.\n\n#kesehatanmental #mentalguru #kesehatanjiwa #kesejahteraanguru #guruindonesia #indonesiamengajar #gurumengajar #gurupengajar #pembelajaranonline #pandemic2020 #semangatguru #semangatpendidik #pendidikindonesia #guruagenperubahanindonesia #menjagakesehatan #menjagakesehatantubuh #pendidikanindonesialebihbaik #pendidikanindonesia","NumberOfLikes":31,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597925615,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 20 14:13:35 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"About once a month I make an appearance in actual work clothes 🖇️🚦🛣️🚲🚶\u200D♀️\n\n#essential #workworkwork #transportationplanner #urbanplanner #pandemic2020 #officeappearance","NumberOfLikes":43,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Amanda C. in Tampa, Florida.

SPEND MORE TIME OUTSIDE AND CONNECTING WITH MOTHER NATURE. \n 🌲 🦢 🌳 🚶\u200D♀️ ⛅️ \n\n\u201CBeing in nature, or even viewing scenes of nature, reduces anger, fear, and stress and increases pleasant feelings. Exposure to nature not only makes you feel better emotionally, it contributes to your physical wellbeing, reducing blood pressure, heart rate, muscle tension, and the production of stress hormones.\u201D\n\n2. KNOW...THIS CANNOT AND WILL NOT LAST FOREVER. 🛑 ✋ \n\nNothing lasts forever. \n\nGood guys n gals always win 🦸\u200D♂️ 🦸\u200D♀️ \n\n3. BE KIND TO ONE ANOTHER! ❤️💝 ❤️ \n\nWe\u2019re all in this together & the world needs a lot more love, especially now. \n\nBe the change you wish to see in the world.\n\nAlso, \u201CWhen we help others and do kind acts, it causes our brain to release endorphins, the chemicals that give us feelings of fervor and high spirits - similar to a \"runner's high.\" Doing something nice for someone also gives the brain a serotonin boost, the chemical that gives us that feeling of satisfaction and well-being.\u201D\n\n4. TAKE A BREAK FROM SOCIAL MEDIA & THE NEWS. 💤 \n\nFrom the moment we hope onto these platforms there\u2019s constant flow of information pushed into our minds and faces.\n\nThere is a lot of great things on these platforms but also a lot of negative that will drain your day.\n\nIf you notice seeing those negative things don\u2019t  improve your day and have a negative influence and impact....Remove it, take a break to recoup, or minimize using them to a healthy level. \n\n5. KNOWING YOU, YES YOU, ARE STRONG, WORTHY, AND ABLE TO GET THROUGH THIS! 💪 \n\nWe often look towards other people to fill something we are feeling we are lacking.\nFor example, say I am so fricken sad, and I want jesse my boyfriend to cheer me up to feel better. Sometimes that works but we forget we have the power to do that for ourselves.\n\nJust like all of this going on. We all have the power to get ourselves through this. Mentally and physically. \n\nRemember your strength, power, and worth you can do gr8 things!","NumberOfLikes":13,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597897032,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 20 06:17:12 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Bath time with mama tonight!!

Police have registered a case of accidental death and suicide looks like a motive as a note has been recovered from the spot.\n\nThe police, in the meantime, will investigate Kamath\u2019s family and close friends. It appears though that Kamath has not blamed anyone in his suicide note, sources said.\n\nKamath was found dead in the bathtub. It was said that the artist was under stress since a long period of time and the coronavirus lockdown made it worse for him.\n\nKamath lived with his mother in his Mumbai apartment.

The first few times we came to this place, it was to rehearse and play live chamber music concerts. This year, we traveled here with the tools of our (pandemic) trade: 5 string instruments and 1 violin in-progress, 2 laptops, a tripod, multiple sets of headphones and earbuds, and all the hand tools a violin maker needs to put the finishing touches on several new instruments. We didn\u2019t forget to print out the negative Covid tests.\n\nTonight, after teaching private lessons, I was on a 2.5 hour Zoom call playing cello and talking about chamber music. At the end we watched a virtual presentation of final recorded projects from the last four weeks of music-making: students, faculty, and admin all came together, almost constantly in correspondence over the past month, to make these projects happen. \n\nIt was not easy, but it was rewarding - to see the final videos, and the happy and proud faces (\u201Call the little faces in squares\u201D) on the screen. Perfection was not the goal, but collaborative music-making was achieved, in spite of the distance. \n\nMaybe now is a good time to sit back and enjoy the sunset. We\u2019ll hope for a better world tomorrow, but whatever comes, we\u2019ll make the best of it.\n\n#goodnightworld #stopandseethebeauty #sliceoflife #musicianslife #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":10,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Hernandez-Williams Fam 🎻🎻🎻🎻 on August 19, 2020.

That is why we have been witnessing countless nations clashing for control of Libya and tensions rising. The virus and pandemic has destroyed the economies and health system of many nations around the world especially in Europe which include Italy, Spain and France. Despite this we have witnessed the leader of the EU Germany open the borders of the EU to many countries and declared a hidden embargo on Turkey. In the past week we have witnessed tensions rise between France and Turkey, this tells us that all of this is for political purposes and not for health purposes. The EU is clashing with Turkey for control in Libya. Experts have now said that Germany is pressuring smaller European nations into cutting trade ties with Turkey. The reason for this is because of Africa, Libya and the Mediterranean. Turkey\u2019s Minister of Defense had announced that France supporting General Haftar goes against the alliance and partnership Turkey and France have. In addition, that French war ships had illegally intercepted Turkish ships in the Mediterranean. \n\nFollow OTRV On YouTube at: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCarPLihJWmTWgWk8pOPI0tA\/\nFollow OTRV On Twitter At: https:\/\/twitter.com\/OTRVideos\nFollow OTRV On Facebook At: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/offtherecord.otrv.3\n\n#mediterranean #germany🇩🇪 #libya #us #deepstate #globalism #german #eu #france #turkey #american #europeanunion #dgap #mediterraneansea #africa #african #pandemic2020 #virus #spain #embargo #sanctions #uae #greece #egypt","NumberOfLikes":3,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by OTRV on August 19, 2020.

It made me think in an emergency situation there may not be a trained person to hand. A lay person is often the first responder. \n\nA few months ago we wouldn't have thought twice about helping in an emergency situation. However, it is now more difficult to know what to do because COVID-19. The decision is very personal and many factors will need to be taken into consideration before making the choice to proceed. Ultimately, a person who has had a cardiac arrest is unlikely to survive if CPR is not administered promptly. \n\nThe HSE suggest the following to minimise risk & improve safety for all involved:\n\n1. Keep your hands away from your face. Wear a mask and gloves if possible. \n\n2. If a person has collapsed always check the area is safe. Look for signs of breathing and signs of life.\n\n3. Don\u2019t listen or feel for breathing by placing your ear & cheek close to the person\u2019s mouth.\n\n4. Call 112 or 999 & ask for an ambulance. If COVID-19 is suspected, tell them.\n\n5. Use an AED as soon as possible. This significantly increases the person\u2019s chances of survival. Place the AED pads on the person\u2019s chest & apply a shock, if prompted by AED. \n\n6. Perform chest compressions only. Do not give mouth to mouth rescue breaths. If there is a perceived risk of infection, you should place a cloth\/towel over the person\u2019s mouth and nose & attempt compression-only CPR & early defibrillation until help arrives.\n\nHow to give compressions:\nAdult: place the heel of your hand on the breastbone at the centre of the person's chest. Place your other hand on top of your first hand & interlock fingers.\nPosition yourself with your shoulders above your hands. Press firmly down on the chest at a depth of 5 to 6cm. Allow chest to recoil & repeat compressions at a rate of 100-120.\n\nChild: use 1 hand, same rate and depth. \nInfant: use 2 fingers in the middle of the chest but at depth of 4cm. Usually, cardiac arrest in children is caused by hypoxia. Do not delay with compressions if doubting a pulse. \n\nSo...Do you know where your nearest AED (defibrillator) is located? \nWould you feel comfortable giving CPR?\nHave you considered doing CPR or first aid course?","NumberOfLikes":183,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Bróna English in Dublin, Ireland.","NumberOfComments":35,"Timestamp":1597867406,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 19 22:03:26 CEST 2020","Location":"Dublin, Ireland"},{"CaptionText":"This whole \u201Cisolation\u201D thing suits me just fine 👌\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#pandemic2020 #pandemic #pandemicpuppy #covidpuppy #pup #pupper #doodlesofinstagram #doodle #doodles #puppylove #doodlesoftheworld #doodlelove #puppylife #puppylover #doodlelovers #childhoodunplugged #postthepeople #thatsdarling #memories #bestfriends #bestwoofs #bestie #bark #rufflife #fluffy #fluffydogs #lifewithdogs #lifewithkids","NumberOfLikes":28,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597867249,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 19 22:00:49 CEST 2020","Location":"The Woodlands, Texas"},{"CaptionText":"Waiting for the #gelato place to open (at 11 am)\n#gelato #portlandmaine #portlandheadlight #visitmaine #mainetheway #maine #mainething #thewaylifeshouldbe #vacationland #gorgeousGelato #pandemic2020 #summertime","NumberOfLikes":15,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Artsinfotos Photography in Portland Head Light with @gorgeousgelato.

I feel like this has been the motto for my life, mostly because it\u2019s had to be. I\u2019ve been put through the motha fuckin RINGER and if I didn\u2019t have this mentality I totally would have crumbled by now. I\u2019ve been thinking about this quote a lot the last few days. If you watch my stories than you know that I am in a terrible situation when it comes to housing right now. Due to the pandemic we have to move like immediately, we didn\u2019t get approved for the loan to buy the house since the landlord wants to sell, and the rental market is terrible. I had a mini breakdown yesterday. I started thinking about how I ALWAYS do everything by the book and things just don\u2019t work out for me. When you are trying to break cycles of poverty, addiction, homelessness, it\u2019s not as easy as \u201Cwork hard and you will succeed\u201D. I\u2019ve spent my entire life working as hard as I can, getting all straight a\u2019s, working multiple jobs, and still I always fall short because of something from my past. Both of my parents have passed away, so I don\u2019t have anyone to help me co-sign for loans, or lend me a few dollars if I need it, or teach me how to build credit or apply for a mortgage. My mom let her addiction get the best of her and she started me off with terrible credit when I turned 18 by using my SSN to sign up for cards, gas and electric.. the list goes on. I\u2019ve been trying to work off the disadvantages growing up in extreme poverty with addict parents my entire life.. and it\u2019s fucking hard. My life has been full of struggles, unbelievable stories, things you only see in the movies.. and I could have let it ruin me. But I just let it fuel my fire. Some days I just want to throw in the towel, but then I think about what I\u2019ve already been able to survive. You can get through ANYTHING with hope. It\u2019s not as easy as \u201Cworking hard\u201D, and it won\u2019t always be a straight path, but if you never give up on yourself, I promise you it will just make you more and more unbreakable every single time. Don\u2019t let your past define you, always believe that you\u2019re destined for more, have hope for your future and know that you are 100% THAT invincible ass bitch!","NumberOfLikes":3761,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":63,"Timestamp":1597861682,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 19 20:28:02 CEST 2020","Location":"Glen Burnie, Maryland"},{"CaptionText":"Found 1 of 7 pieces of the wellness set, legendary at that ! 😂😂😂😂😂 #elderscrillsonline #bethesda #oblivion #morrowind #greymoor #summerset #elsweyr #skyrim #covid19 #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":14,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Sweep Jr on August 19, 2020.

Most people infected will experience a mild to moderate respiratory illness, whilst others will show no symptoms at all. However for some the effects are severe and longer lasting.\n\nOur aim in this yoga programme is to play some role in aiding the process of recovery. By only requiring the use of mostly basic props and furniture, we have tried to make the poses as accessible as possible for everyone.\n\nThe programme was compiled thanks to advice and guidance from Abhijata Iyengar, Lois Steinberg, Gulnaaz Dashti, Stephanie Quirk, the IY(UK) Therapy Committee, IY(UK) teachers who have experienced the virus themselves, and decades of work by BKS Iyengar and Dr Geeta S. Iyengar in medical classes at RIMYI in Pune.\n\nSee the link in our bio to access the video and booklet, which are both freely available. Please consider donating a contribution towards this and future Iyengar yoga therapy resources 🙏\n\nThanks to all involved in creating the programme and to @adrienne_karmaspaceyoga for designing the e-book\n\n#iyengaryoga #yogatherapy #covid19 #covid_19 #coronavirus #recovery #covidhelp #yogaforhealing #yoga #mypandemicsurvivalplan #sarscov2 #pandemic #pandemic2020 #staysafe #virus #postcovid #yogapractice #loveyoga #yogateachers  #iyengarmethod #yogadaily #practiceyoga #yogisofinstagram #yogajourney","NumberOfLikes":11,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Vanessa Oviedo on August 19, 2020.

So if your Four Walls aren\u2019t in the right place then that\u2019s your first step.\n.\n🚨If your Four Walls are fine then I would look next at anything you have in collections. Bringing your payments current is going to be your priority. \n. \n❄️If your walls are fine and your payments are current then you get to decide if you prefer the avalanche or the snowball method of paying off debt! Briefly stated, the avalanche method means you prioritize paying off the one debt with the highest interest rate while continuing to make minimum payments on everything else. The snowball method means you pay the smallest debt first and then snowball the payment you were making to that debt and add that payment amount to your next debt you choose to tackle. \n.\n🏔The avalanche method typically saves you more money in the long term because you pay less in interest by tackling the highest interest items first. Some people though prefer the snowball method because there is more of a sense of progress because you see the debts disappear off your list one by one. \n. \n⛄️That said...I personally am a snowball person. For me I like how motivated I am by smashing out one debt at a time. Ultimately, if you choose avalanche but then you\u2019re not motivated and you fall off the wagon then it\u2019s not better than snowball at all. 🤷🏻\u200D♀️ So whichever works for you and keeps you motivated and on track is the right one. \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~","NumberOfLikes":7,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Emerald, PA-S on August 19, 2020.
