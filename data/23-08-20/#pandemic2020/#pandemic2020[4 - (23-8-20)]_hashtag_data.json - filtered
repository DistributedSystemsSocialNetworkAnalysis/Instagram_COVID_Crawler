I took this picture on the fields of Hopton at the beginning of the lockdown in the UK. Every house you walked pass during the pandemic, had either w picture or a painting of a rainbow on their window. This one though was the most hopeful gesture for me. Where it\u2019s placed and how it\u2019s displayed; on a piece of stone, right below metal wire fence, on top of a hill looking down the village and all you can see behind it is the blue sky. üåà\nSo many words and messages hidden in this piece of stone, carefully placed on top the field. If we are not the creator of our own hope and future, who else is? Isn\u2019t life about making sense of those disastrous  and tragic moments? Making the unpleasant and least hopeful situations into something that strengthen us to carry on. Exactly at this point, where the wires stop you and put limits in your belief and your strength to carry on, physically and mentally, you got to look at those images that you have created in mind and believe you can carry on and you must carry on.

This delirium resolves in the morning and the cycle repeats itself at sunset.  The treatment for this is frequent reorientation, early mobility, adjusting lighting levels, sleep management, etc. For me, an opposite phenomenon occurs, which I\u2019d characterize as pre-dawn moments of extreme clarity, usually when I am out on my first walk, long before the sun rises. This morning it was the gnawing and unfathomable truth that we in America are living under a dictatorship in the midst of a raging pandemic with a government that has systematically eroded our basic liberties and protections under the watch of a demented sociopath, and that lots of people I know IRL are 100% OK with this. The feeling behind this is that of screaming for help which never arrives. Ironic that i passed by this @blackcattips objet d\u2019art as i was dealing with this thought. The only way to prevent the ensuing maelstrom of delirium and depression is to move my body, lose my mind and come to my senses, and reorient myself to this moment now, which is all any of us really has. #thismomentnowisallwehave #pandemic2020 #clarity #dumptrump2020 #kirkwoodatl","NumberOfLikes":12,"Hashtags":["#thismomentnowisallwehave","#pandemic2020","#clarity","#dumptrump2020","#kirkwoodatl"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Betty Rubble in Kirkwood.

A crisis like this can keep people out of the job #market for a very long time and also bring unexpected large medical expenditures. We should be prepared for the worst and make the necessary arrangements to make sure we get to live our normal life.\n\nHaving an emergency fund of at least two years of expenditure could give us adequate protection to fight any future unforeseen circumstances.

Let me explain the picture on this post. For the moment I live in South Korea (no Im not Korean) , this picture was taken at my local gym on August 19th. On the left side of the pic we have a column that depicts a person that is infected with Covid-19. On the right side we have a peson that is not infected with Covid-19. Now according to this propaganda piece of laminated paper, if you and the infected person are wearing a mask the possibility of infection is 1.5%. If the infected and the none infected are not wearing a mask then the possibility of infection is 100%. Now I dont know if any of you remember this but around 5 months ago the WHO was against wearing a mask and even said that wearing a mask doesn't protect you from the virus. They were right but as soon as Trump dropped financial aid support for the WHO , they sided with communist China and changed their mindset regarding the mask. The mask doesn't protect you from shit, that is the point of this posting. It only slowly poisons your lungs by breathing your own C02. The mask is only a symbol of communist compliance to the government, that is the only purpose for it. \n\nNow for my fellow Koreans, please wake up! Stop believing the mainstream news, stop watching your apps about infected people, those numbers are fake most of the time. Even if you die from a heart attack some hospitals are labeling the cause of death as Covid-19 in order to get funding. Stop trusting your government, they are best friends with communist China and have no interest in fixing this situation at all other than continuing on inposing this stupid rules. Yeah Korea is safe from the chaos in the West, but nothing last forever and soon Korea will fall into civil unrest...people can only take so much before they explode and decide that enough is fucking enough!! The mask is a symbol of communism plain and simple. That is all.\n\n#control #covid19sucks #billgatescoronavirus #billgates #drfauci #drfauciisafraud #pandemic2020 #covid_19 #fake #bullshit #hiddenagenda #science #commonsense #stop #mask #fuckmask #lies #2020corruption #hydroxychloroquine #doctorsfortruth #cure #vaccine #endtimes #Zionist","NumberOfLikes":12,"Hashtags":["#control","#covid19sucks","#billgatescoronavirus","#billgates","#drfauci","#drfauciisafraud","#pandemic2020","#covid_19","#fake","#bullshit","#hiddenagenda","#science","#commonsense","#stop","#mask","#fuckmask","#lies","#2020corruption","#hydroxychloroquine","#doctorsfortruth","#cure","#vaccine","#endtimes","#Zionist"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The Collector ‚ò† in Seoul, Korea.

The production team copied the interior of the house, including the spiral staircase, almost exactly on a soundstage at Paramount.\n\nPlease note that this is a private residence so if you visit please do not trespass or disturb the people that live there.\n\nConsidered to be one of the greatest movies of all time, the film stars Fred MacMurray as an insurance salesman, Barbara Stanwyck as a provocative housewife who wishes her husband were dead, and Edward G. Robinson as a claims adjuster whose job is to find phony claims. The term \"double indemnity\" refers to a clause in certain life insurance policies that doubles the payout in rare cases when the death is accidental, such as falling off a train.\n\nPraised by many critics when first released, \u201CDouble Indemnity\u201D was nominated for seven Academy Awards but did not win any. Widely regarded as a classic, it often is cited as having set the standard for film noir.\n\nFun facts - The blonde wig that Barbara Stanwyck is wearing throughout the movie was the idea of Billy Wilder.

According to scientists, at least 70 percent of the population must have antibodies to prevent an outbreak, The New Indian Express (TNIE) reported quoting PTI.\n\nHowever, some experts suggest that even if half the population had immunity, there might be a protective effect, the report added.\n\nWHO\u2019s emergencies chief Dr.Michael Ryan largely dismissed that theory at a press briefing on Tuesday, saying we should not live in hope of achieving herd immunity.\n\nAs a global population, we are nowhere close to the levels of immunity required to stop this disease transmitting, he was quoted as saying by PTI.\n\n\u201CThis is not a solution we should be looking to. Most studies conducted to date have suggested only about 10 percent to 20 percent of people have antibodies,\u201D he added.\n\nDr. Bruce Aylward, senior adviser to WHO\u2019s director-general, added that any mass immunisation campaign with a COVID-19 vaccine would aim to cover far more than 50 percent of the world\u2019s population.\n\n#WHO #heardimmunity #pandemic2020 #COVID19 #vaccination #odishabytesnews","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#WHO","#heardimmunity","#pandemic2020","#COVID19","#vaccination","#odishabytesnews"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Odisha Bytes in Bhubaneswar, India.

Most people infected will experience a mild to moderate respiratory illness, whilst others will show no symptoms at all. However for some the effects are severe and longer lasting.\n\nOur aim in this yoga programme is to play some role in aiding the process of recovery. By only requiring the use of mostly basic props and furniture, we have tried to make the poses as accessible as possible for everyone.\n\nThe programme was compiled thanks to advice and guidance from Abhijata Iyengar, Lois Steinberg, Gulnaaz Dashti, Stephanie Quirk, the IY(UK) Therapy Committee, IY(UK) teachers who have experienced the virus themselves, and decades of work by BKS Iyengar and Dr Geeta S.

The most interesting aspect of the park is the Doll's Head Trail which is an outdoor gallery of sorts. The art is created from the trash that has been found in the park after the South River floods. Doll's heads are incorporated into many of the installations which resemble the work of Howard Finster. I found the doll's heads creepy, especially during this pandemic which is why I avoided sharing those with you.

Oh sure being a millionaire would be nice, but a millionaire who can\u2019t rest? What good is all that money if I can\u2019t sleep on it??\n\nI\u2019m being tongue in cheek of course, but I continue to TRY to be good at resting. There are just so many things that get in the way. For a little while I was thinking that this was me, that it was my fault I was bad at resting. But lately I\u2019ve noticed that resting is a TREND, so it\u2019s not just me.\n\nWhen I say TREND, I mean I\u2019ve noticed an increase in the amount of memes, pep talks, justifications and content around the topic of rest. I\u2019m defining rest as doing nothing or sleeping. That\u2019s IT.  I get it, we\u2019re all armpits deep in this pandemic, and our collective ability to learn new things (Homeschool! Masking! Working from home! Working from home while homeschooling and masking!) has been put to the ultimate tests. 2020, it\u2019s been a bit much.\n\n BUt all this learning is tiring, and it\u2019s had us leaning hard into the indulgences of \u201Cself-care capitalism\u201D. For some, it\u2019s online shopping, for others it\u2019s hours of video games, for many it\u2019s all the chips and cereal you can handle after 8pm. #becausecovid seems to be all the reason we need to justify these choices, while posting to socials and getting a resounding reply: \u201Cmeeeee toooooo!\u201D\n\nAnd lately, although slowly, I\u2019ve started to see people mention their struggle with actual rest. Indulgence is one thing, but it can ALWAYS be multitasked between Zoom calls, or layered into the late night hours after the kids are in bed. Indulgences labeled as \u201Cself-care\u201D rarely get in the way of our productivity. If anything they provide evidence of being PRODUCTIVE. \u201CLOOK AT THIS,\u201D we share online, \u201CI HAVE SELF CARED.\u201D But what did it take out of us?\n\nWe all seem to know that rest would help us manage our shared sense of foreboding and doom, yet it\u2019s the hardest \u201Cvice\u201D to embrace. We\u2019ve all been quarantined at home, and yet no one\u2019s instituted a national nap time? #idliketospeakwiththemanager\n\n**continues in comments","NumberOfLikes":19,"Hashtags":["#becausecovid","#idliketospeakwiththemanager"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":17,"Timestamp":1597755465,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 18 14:57:45 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"baldndcurious","CaptionText":"#fear #manipulation #corruption #faith #unknown \n#governmentoverreach #scamdemic2020 #pandemic2020 #covid  #warriornun #evil","NumberOfLikes":11,"Hashtags":["#fear","#manipulation","#corruption","#faith","#unknown","#governmentoverreach","#scamdemic2020","#pandemic2020","#covid","#warriornun","#evil"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597755161,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 18 14:52:41 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"natalayo","CaptionText":"–ü–µ—Ä–µ–∂–∏–≤–∞–µ–º—ã–π –Ω–∞–º–∏ –ø–µ—Ä–∏–æ–¥ —è–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç—Å—è –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–º!ü§™#pandemia #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":113,"Hashtags":["#pandemia","#pandemic2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Natalya Butyrina in –ì–∞—Ç—á–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π –î–≤–æ—Ä–µ—Ü.
