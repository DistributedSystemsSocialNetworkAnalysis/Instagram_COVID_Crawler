I came here as one type of person; one type of nurse.\n\nFaceTime calls with a patients loved ones has become as routine as checking vitals. Daily, lengthy telephone updates, trying to calm the anxious, hearing the frustration of our no visitors policy, and hearing the tears and cries when we have to give bad news.\n\nTypically, pre corona, we had years of science on our side. We understood complicated disease processes, we had treatment plans, medications, and a plan of care. But now? It\u2019s all out the window. We have anecdotal medications and treatments. We don\u2019t really know if what we\u2019re doing is the best care. We don\u2019t understand the disease process, the tornado it causes on the other systems of the body, if there\u2019s any valuable correlation between antibodies and long term protection. We have hypotheses.\n\nSo when families ask us questions and we\u2019re left saying, \u201CI don\u2019t know\u201D it frustrates us as much as it frustrates them. Because we\u2019re used to knowing, to having answers, and knowing how to save our patients.\n\nOur days are spent worrying about oxygen saturation, trusting our nursing gut when something is off but we can\u2019t explain it, increasing oxygen delivery, updating families, coordinating with the physicians, praying we have an ICU bed available when our patient is tanking.\n\nWe are running out of beds, out of ventilators, out of vapotherms. Our staff is getting covid in waves. We\u2019re treating our coworkers. We run and nurse all day long and when we get home it catches up with us.\n\nWe are tired. We are exhausted. We are bruised and battered. We are crying because we have our patients for days or weeks and we become attached to them and their families. We bond and love and care for them like they\u2019re our own family. And our hearts are fucking breaking.\n\nWear a mask. Wash your hands. Be considerate. Help us so we can help you.

Built in 1953, the green, retro, Art Deco building looks much the same as it did onscreen. It\u2019s located at \u202A1830 Winona Boulevard\u202C in the Los Feliz area of Los Angeles. Please note that this is a private residence so if you visit please do not trespass or disturb the people that live there.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t seen this popular series yet, it basically gives viewers an insight into the mind of Joe, who is stalking the women he loves. Based on a series of novels, the second season is loosely based on the novel \u201CHidden Bodies\u201D by Caroline Kepnes - which picks up with Joe where the first season left off. That\u2019s all I\u2019ll say. I don\u2019t want to give any spoilers for those if you who haven\u2019t seen the series yet. \n\nGood news for fans of the show...an official return date hasn't been announced just yet, but Netflix has renewed the series for a third season!\n\nFun facts - It's hard to imagine anyone else playing Joe, but Penn Badgley was unsure about taking the role at first.  In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said he was \"conflicted\" about the part, largely because the show is framed as a love story. \"If this is a love story, what is it saying?\" he said. Ultimately, discussions with showrunners convinced him to take the part. \n\nDue to the fact that most of Joe\u2019s lines are actually voiceover, Penn said that most days he wouldn't have much dialogue to actually memorize. In fact, Penn\u2019s first acting jobs were doing voiceovers for a radio station and Nintendo 64 video games when he was only 10 years old.  #filminglocation #losfeliz #younetflix #pennbadgley #hollywoodtour #pandemic2020 #socialdistancing #wearamask #tonymiros @younetflix","NumberOfLikes":46,"Hashtags":["#filminglocation","#losfeliz","#younetflix","#pennbadgley","#hollywoodtour","#pandemic2020","#socialdistancing","#wearamask","#tonymiros"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1597598564,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 16 19:22:44 CEST 2020","Location":"Los Feliz\/ Hollywood Hills"},{"Owner":"deardiary_pandemic","CaptionText":"The cloud with horns. \n.. \n..\n#pandemicart\n#pandemiclife \n#pandemic2020 \n#pandemic \n#pandemicpoetry\n#writersofinstagram \n#writerlife\n#zines \n#zinester\n#zinestagram \n#wordsmatter\n#wordsgasm \n#deardiary\n#pandemicdiary","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#pandemicart","#pandemiclife","#pandemic2020","#pandemic","#pandemicpoetry","#writersofinstagram","#writerlife","#zines","#zinester","#zinestagram","#wordsmatter","#wordsgasm","#deardiary","#pandemicdiary"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Dear Diary on August 16, 2020.

The passwords and usernames of 9,041 GCKey account holders \"were acquired fraudulently and used to try and access government services,\" the authorities said. All affected accounts have been cancelled. About 5,500 Canada Revenue Agency accounts were targeted in this and another attack, the authorities said, adding that access to these accounts has been suspended to protect taxpayer information. An investigation was launched by the government and the federal police to determine whether there were any breaches of privacy and whether information was obtained from these accounts, the authorities said. According to the CBC, a number of Canadians have reported since the beginning of August that their banking information associated with their Canada Revenue Agency accounts has been altered.

Scientists suspect that they contracted the virus by eating or touching an animal who was infected.\n_\nThis is yet another reason why we should all be #vegan.\n_\nIt's bad enough that the consumption of #meat and other animal-based foods contributes to #heartdisease, #diabetes and #cancer, and that harmful bacteria found in the intestines and faeces of #animals, including salmonella and E coli, often cause outbreaks of food poisoning. Do we really want to add more deadly animal-borne diseases into the mix?\n_\nMany devastating disease outbreaks come about because humans house animals in filthy, severely crowded farms and markets \u2013 breeding grounds for pathogens \u2013 in order to satisfy their meat habits.\n_\nIt's not at all unusual for viruses and other pathogens to jump from animals into the human population. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 75% of emerging infectious diseases originate in animals.
