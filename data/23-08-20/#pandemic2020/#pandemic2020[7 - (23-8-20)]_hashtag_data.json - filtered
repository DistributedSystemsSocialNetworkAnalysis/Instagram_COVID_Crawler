The pandemic has certainly changed things, it\u2019s not what it used to be and the show I worked last night wasn\u2019t even the usual company I work for! \n\nIt\u2019s been a couple years since I worked for @cwe.canada and it\u2019s an environment I truly missed. Every locker room has similarities and every one of them has differences. The difference I enjoy with CWE is actually change, the roster always can change and you can work with a multitude of peers that you haven\u2019t before from other provinces and promotions. A few of my favourite moments were filming promos with people I\u2019ve known for years but never worked with like @lumberjack_larrywoods and @the_cheetahbear . \n\nBeing a travelling roadshow of a promotion CWE isn\u2019t without a heathy dose of new experiences and learning opportunities as well, like trying to amass a float for the door at 6pm on a Friday night when banks are closed because a truck broke down and the float would be late to putting together a newly built ring for the first time. But no matter those hurdles or any other the company always persevered and puts on a great show from bell to bell  that engages and entertains the fans.\nI can say without any embellishment that I really missed working with CWE.\n\nCovid 19 has changed the world in so many ways, it could be another 6 months or more before I work another show, but I\u2019m glad I had the opportunity to get out there with my peers and in front of a crowd again. The tight suit also reminded me its time to drop a few lbs. This pandemic has changed us and the way we lived our lives so much, hope everyone is coping well. #cwewrestling #indywrestlingmatters #imdywrestling #stalbertcommunityhall #wrestlingmerch #yegwrestling #yeg #yeggers #pandemic2020 #pandemicchanges #covid19 #thearcherreport #ThadAboutTown #thehotseat #archerout","NumberOfLikes":54,"Hashtags":["#cwewrestling","#indywrestlingmatters","#imdywrestling","#stalbertcommunityhall","#wrestlingmerch","#yegwrestling","#yeg","#yeggers","#pandemic2020","#pandemicchanges","#covid19","#thearcherreport","#ThadAboutTown","#thehotseat","#archerout"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Thaddeus Archer the Third on August 15, 2020 tagging @onlygavinever, and @vicky_venetsianos_1.

Before today I had only heard of these inequalities, but today we were thrown into the thick of it. My daughter developed concerning symptoms on Friday night and we were directed to wait until our PCP opened the next morning. The waiting was awful. üò∞ All the unknowns came flooding in. When the office finally opened we were directed to a virtual visit because she had symptoms. The option to possibly come in for lab draws\/tests if needed was on the table. Well apparently weekend COVID-19 testing wasn\u2019t accessible to our PCP. üòß But they were happy to prophylactically treat her strep! Wait hold on a minute. We don\u2019t know if she has strep or a cold or a virus or COVID-19, but let\u2019s fill her with an antibiotic and make her wait for a COVID-19 test. Seems like a great plan. ü§® However waiting for the test not only affected our family, but puts all the staff, children and parents of our daycare and anyone else she\u2019s been around at risk which I was so uncomfortable with. And not knowing if she has strep affects our son. He\u2019s at risk for a rheumatic fever flare up if he\u2019s exposed. We didn\u2019t want to put him through a strep test if we don\u2019t even know whether or not our daughter has strep. He was more then welcome to come in and get a strep test, but not the child who has symptoms. Does that seem right? \n\nI get that precautions have to be in place but this whole situation just doesn\u2019t sit well. Thankfully we have a wonderful children\u2019s hospital in our town who was more then happy to see her, evaluate her and test her for both strep and COVID-19 today!  The rapid strep test was negative! ü•≥ No antibiotic for her and no unnecessary testing for our son. üôåüèº We still don\u2019t have access to rapid COVID-19 testing so we\u2019re hoping for the 24hr timeframe turnaround vs the 72hr time frame. ü§ûüèºAnd lastly thank you to everyone who has reached out and supported us during these unwavering hours. Our neighbors for bringing snacks and sending love messages to our daughter so she can look out the window and smile.

Previously I read an anthology of poetry and loved it. This is an anthology of letters and I knew I had to make it mine as soon as I lay eyes on it. It's beautiful to say the least.\n\n#bookreviewüëá\n\n\"You never came to stay; you never left to return. I never loved to un-love you, and that is the tragedy of my ordinary life.\"\n\n'With Love' is a collection of letters, each very deep and special in its own way. There's a longing for lost love and friendship. There are letters that talk of estranged relationships, and others which speak of people who you felt the closest to not having enough time for you. And then, there are letters which are ambiguous and reading through them you can't figure out who's written them to whom unless you reach the very end. These letters make you raise some very important questions, questions which you try answering but can't. \n\nThere were letters which made me smile, others which made me cry, a few which reminded me of people who have been a part of my life in the past and others that I have loved. There were a few that made me keep the book down and made me sympathise with people who have lived through tragedies. There are letters that talk about ends and others about beginnings. Some about heartbreaks, others about hope. Some about love and others about fear. \n\nA letter made me raise a very important question which was- How do you decide it's time to leave a friendship, a relationship, even a marriage?\nThere was one letter in particular which made me realise how we often contemplate things and don't do them and regret it later. And one made me think how we feel stupid for our actions when in reality all they are is cute. \n\nAll in all this anthology of letters was full of realisations for me. It evoked feelings that I didn't know existed within me. It brought about a flurry of emotions and I was forced to sit back and reflect and give myself closure on things that lie there hanging. It was a book which proved helpful to me in a way no one ever has.\n\nRead it to feel things. Read it to reminisce a beautiful past and be assured that a great future lies ahead.","NumberOfLikes":326,"Hashtags":["#qotd-","#bookreviewüëá"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by JAPNEET\u2022BOOKSTAGRAM\u2022IN üáÆüá≥ in Delhi, India with @booknerdparadise, @booksparks, @penguinindia, @ttt_official, @penguinbooks, @flatlay_gallery, @flatlay, @theb00kstagram, @flatlayindia, @ig.reads, @igreadsindia, @mybookfeatures, @midlandbooksofficial, @bookishladiesclub, @flatlaysquad, @bookishfeatures_, @perksofbookstagram, @bookreviewfeatures, and @flatlayphotographers.","NumberOfComments":57,"Timestamp":1597491616,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 13:40:16 CEST 2020","Location":"Delhi, India"},{"CaptionText":"Help, I got \"Pussy Monster\" by Lil Wayne stuck in my head and it won't go away ü•¥ #ButFirstASelfie #SelfiesForSelfLove #SelfieNation #SelfieGram #PhotoOfTheDay #Quarantine #Pandemic #Pandemic2020 #Coronavirus #Covid #Covid19 #Kawaii #KawaiiGirl #KawaiiGoth #BubbleGoth #PastelGoth #PastelGrunge #AltGirl #AltGirls #AlternativeGirl #AlternativeGirls #Thicc #ThickChick #NewHair #DyedHair","NumberOfLikes":18,"Hashtags":["#ButFirstASelfie","#SelfiesForSelfLove","#SelfieNation","#SelfieGram","#PhotoOfTheDay","#Quarantine","#Pandemic","#Pandemic2020","#Coronavirus","#Covid","#Covid19","#Kawaii","#KawaiiGirl","#KawaiiGoth","#BubbleGoth","#PastelGoth","#PastelGrunge","#AltGirl","#AltGirls","#AlternativeGirl","#AlternativeGirls","#Thicc","#ThickChick","#NewHair","#DyedHair"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by üç≠ü¶Ñ UnicornPlushy ü¶Ñüç≠ on August 15, 2020.

India gained independence and freedom from British Colonial rule at midnight on August 14, 1947 and was partitioned into two countries -- India (Hindu) and Pakistan (Muslim). Turmoil created by the British resulted in 15 million people being displaced and having to flee from Pakistan to India, or India to Pakistan. \n\nIn modern day India the tension between Muslims and Hindus still exists. In the community, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists and a small group of Christian families live together in crowded lanes, each worshipping their own way. Small Hindu temples exist near the Muslim prayer room. Families mourn for each other when a death occurs, celebrate and congratulate each other on the occasion of a wedding or a birth, and drink chai together in each other's homes. The tension between religions is tempered by the need to help each other, but the differences simmer behind closed doors.\n\nToday despite the pandemic raging around them, they're celebrating and waving flags. They're watching grandiose speeches on television or on the family phone in their one room homes, wanting to hear there is a notion of hope, an end in sight to the pandemic, news about restarting India, job creation -- any relief around the corner for their Hindu, Muslim, Buddhist or Christian families in the community and their relatives in far flung rural villages.\n.\n.\n\n#independenceday #celebrate #flagdayüáÆüá≥ #gathering #pandemic2020 #nonprofit #charity #philanthropy #give #communitycelebration #proudindia #indialife #crowd #photography #documentaryphotography #streetsofindia #festival #family #together #mumbai","NumberOfLikes":22,"Hashtags":["#independenceday","#celebrate","#flagdayüáÆüá≥","#gathering","#pandemic2020","#nonprofit","#charity","#philanthropy","#give","#communitycelebration","#proudindia","#indialife","#crowd","#photography","#documentaryphotography","#streetsofindia","#festival","#family","#together","#mumbai"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Dirty Wall Project Foundation on August 14, 2020.

Trump has inherited the Death Star of mind manipulation. The digital dictatorship that we have been living under which knows our behaviors better than our own families...and even ourselves.

This is primarily because we shutdown schools during the spring and went into summer break. Most kids have been home for months. As you make these decisions for your family, I recommend that you listen to your state\u2019s chief epidemiologist. I urge you to look at numbers not only in your state but also in your county.For instance, CA is going to look very different from UT and SLC county may look different from Utah County.\n\nSusceptibility and Transmission:ü¶†ü§íüò∑\nSwipe üëâüèΩ to see the CDC chart on transmission by age. We see 4x lower COVID19 cases in kids and 9X lower rates of death due to COVID19.Talk to your school about all the precautions they are taking to keep their caregivers and kids safe.¬†\n\nYou also have to consider the testing rates in kids. This is an invasive nasopherangeal swab. Therefore, if most kids are asymptomatic or have very minor systems, parents are not running to get their kids tested.\n\nImmune system response in kids üë∂üèΩ üß´ü¶† \nKids have fewer or less mature ACE2 receptors on their lung surface. The SARS-CoV-2 virus binds to the ACE2 protein in order to enter the cell.Of course getting tissue samples from children can be very challenging.¬†\n\nHowever, in one study, researchers examined the expression of ACE2 in nasal epithelium in 305 patients with 4 cohorts.They found that the expression of ACE2 was lowest in the youngest cohort (ages 4-9).¬†\n\nThere are also some studies to understand if kids have trained immunity and a higher¬†constitutional lymphocyte count.

Recently in the SF Bay Area, UCSF injected a COVID-19 patient with the two-drug combo. \u2063\n\u2063\nThe 1,000 or so patients in the study will all be given a Remdesivir infusion. Half will also be injected with interferon, while the other half will get a placebo. The patients will receive the combo every other day for four doses.  The researchers will then study how the patients in each group react over time. \u2063\n\u2063\nWhy this combo? Remdesivir has shown to shorten recovery times among COVID-19 patients. As for interferon, a recent UK study found that hospitalized COVID-19 patients who received an inhaled form of interferon beta fared better. These patients had a 79% lower risk of developing more debilitating symptoms, decrease in both fatalities and the number of patients on breathing tubes compared to people on a placebo. \u2063\n \u2063\nResearchers hope Remdesivir will attack the virus while inhaled interferon will lower inflammation. Together, the two drugs may be able to decrease hospitalizations, decrease need for breathing tubes and decrease deaths. In fact if the two-drug combo is successful, researchers hope to use it as an outpatient treatment to prevent hospitalizations. NIH said preliminary results are expected in the fall. \u2063\n\u2063\nClinical trials likes these are examples of the different ways scientist are actively looking for definitive treatment for COVID-19. They offer more incentive to intensify the search for more effective treatments. \u2063\n\u2063\nHang in there my friends. We are getting through this one day at a time.
