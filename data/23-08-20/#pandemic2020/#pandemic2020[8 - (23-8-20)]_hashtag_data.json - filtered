In the past, some epidemics and pandemics have been found to be associated with varying levels of bacterial\/fungal co-infections, which are a major cause of mortality. For example, data suggests that co-infection is associated with more severe outcomes in seasonal and pandemic influenza and may account for up to 30% of cases of Community Acquired Pneumonia. \nStudies have shown that antibiotics are being administered to a majority of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. While this protocol may be justified in light of the history of pandemic co-infections, there are also increasing concerns about the growing incidence of antibiotic resistance.  Therefore, researchers identified \u201Ca clinical need for robust investigation into co-infection in patients with COVID-19.2\nIn a systematic review and meta-analysis researchers evaluated thirty studies encompassing 3,834 patients hospitalized for COVID-19.  Results showed that patients in ICU wards had a higher proportion of bacterial co-infection than patients in ICU\/mixed ward settings. The overall incidence of bacterial co-infection in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was 7%, while in studies that included only ICU patients the incidence was 14%. Other authors have estimated the overall incidence of secondary infection in COVID-19 patients to be between 10-30% of cases.2 The most common bacterial pathogens identified by this review are Mycoplasma pneumonia followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. \nThe prevalence of viral co-infections was 3%, with influenza A and Respiratory Syncytial Virus occurring most frequently. Co-infection with fungal pathogens was reported in only three of the studies included in this review. However, an increasing number of reports from Europe of COVID-19 patients with possible or probable pulmonary aspergillosis, suggests that further investigation into co-infection with fungal pathogens is warranted.","NumberOfLikes":14,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Desbio Seminars on August 14, 2020.

We never know when it would be our last day. And the most disturbing emotion that people feel, after experiencing life at first hand, is \"regret.\"  The regret of not saying things when there was time.\n\nThis year was quite a disturbing one. But we can't just say that life was more promising before all of this. \n\nSo, the question that I wonder about is 'why?' Why do people not say things before it is too late? Why people can go the extra mile to prove someone wrong but can never express how much they love each other. And it is not about the people that are close to us. It is about expressing gratitude to all the people that ever had an impact on us. Why can't we just speak about the moments when someone appreciated us or made us feel special.\n\nI thought about starting this account a lot. I backed off many times. I just talked myself out of it, saying that what can I even do with this.\n\nBut this pandemic made me confident about giving my drop of sanity to this vast insane ocean. No matter how small it is.\n\nAs the name suggests, Patra (a Hindi word that means letter in English), this account is about me writing letters to all humans and characters that ever impacted me. One who reads these posts can also write letters to the same person, about your favourite memory of them.

They diverted existing resources into creating a much needed product for the health and wellbeing of their country! A great example of sustainability. This was literally just weeks after they had worked with us for the Oscars campaign to hand-craft an exquisite gown (see image) for Kaitlyn Dever! \u2063\n🍃\u2063\nLVMH has also committed to getting 30 percent of its energy from renewable sources and reducing carbon emissions by 25 percent throughout the company by the end of 2020 and they are well on track to meeting these goals despite challenges with Covid.

Rates of suicide, domestic violence and all forms of abuse have risen astronomically. If you\u2019re blessed to have a job, security and happiness at this time - remember that the majority, are not as fortunate as you. \n\nI count my blessings, I practise gratitude - but I\u2019m prone to triggers. Lockdown makes me feel trapped and isolated, which evokes sadness & anxieties. Outdoor walks are helping me get through the days and I need only reach out - to realise, I am not alone.\n\nWe are truly in this together, I frequently FaceTime my family in the UK, my sis-in-law my girlfriends and my Uni mates, and we\u2019re all over it & feeling the same... There are common emotions & triggers we are all experiencing.\n\nI\u2019ve been so happy to notice alot of people creating music, painting & channeling their inner child whilst all this is going on. I think it\u2019s really beautiful & therapeutic - in a way, we are healing. This is a time of self-reflection and as I say often, healing often means falling first to learn later.\n\nBe kind, to yourself & those around you, try not to do things that harm you. Be accountable, open up to those you trust, splurge on things that are good for you. Before you fire up, attempt to understand where your fear is coming from. Communicate honestly, choose vulnerability instead... you\u2019d be surprised how many people can relate.\n\nRegardless of your view on the situation. Don\u2019t cut yourself off, If you\u2019re feeling depression, anxiety, fear or anger; know that you\u2019re not alone. Reach out to your tribe, it\u2019s more important than ever, that we\u2019re here to support one another. ♥️\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#lockdown  #covid19 #saveourchildren  #corona #pandemic2020  #viclockdown  #domesticviolence  #abuse #healing  #therapy  #heal  #pandemic  #covid  #bloggers  #photography  #typography  #wordsmith  #middleeasternmusic  #shortpoetry #thelatestquote  #goodvibes  #lifequotes  #love  #poetrycommunity  #poem  #poet  #poems  #quotes  #writer","NumberOfLikes":41,"Hashtags":["#lockdown","#covid19","#saveourchildren","#corona","#pandemic2020","#viclockdown","#domesticviolence","#abuse","#healing","#therapy","#heal","#pandemic","#covid","#bloggers","#photography","#typography","#wordsmith","#middleeasternmusic","#shortpoetry","#thelatestquote","#goodvibes","#lifequotes","#love","#poetrycommunity","#poem","#poet","#poems","#quotes","#writer"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ልꪑ\u200Bꫀ\u200Bꫀ\u200B𝘳\u200Bꪖ 🇦🇺🇬🇧🇮🇪🇦🇪 in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

I was excited to see the clouds and light return as it\u2019s been a few weeks since we\u2019ve had good clouds and light. Today is day #150 since we\u2019ve started sheltering in place. I\u2019ve been missing a lot of sunsets because every night at 8, our neighborhood puts on a concert. We started on Easter Sunday and have now played 117 concerts with only a few missed days here and there. We started off howling to thank frontline workers and it\u2019s evolved to multi-instrument concerts. There are some days where I\u2019m so busy with work and keeping the kids busy (or from killing each other) that it\u2019s the only time I get to step outside. I play the flute, my son plays the trumpet\/piano, my other son the piano\/ukulele, and my husband occasionally plays the piano as well.  We have neighbors who play the trombone, guitar, ukulele and mandolin.  In those 117 days, we\u2019ve celebrated a graduation, numerous birthdays and even bid farewell to a neighbor who moved after living in the neighborhood for 28 years. Despite being in the neighborhood for 14 years, we\u2019ve gotten to really bond with everyone and get to know them better. As much as I love a good sunset, the tradeoff has definitely been worth it. After 117 days, we\u2019re always looking for new songs to play. If you have any suggestions, please write it in the comments.  How have you all been and what have you been doing during this unique time?  I hope you\u2019re all staying healthy and wearing those masks. ☺️😷💜\n.\n.\n.\n#sunsetlight #paintedsky #colorfulclouds #sunsetbeauty #beautyiseverywhere #theskyabove #silhouettephotography

Pandora's box is open.  Welcome.\n Controlling the system through digital slavery.  Exploitation will be a blessing.  The purchase of significantly cheaper global manufacturing assets will begin soon.\n The Central Bank, Central Banks, the Basel Committee give recommendations to all the Central Banks of the World.  The center of global government is in Basel, Switzerland.\n Those who did not support became Outcasts.\n Syria, Iran, North Korea.\n All current business models are not sustainable and must be revised.  This is an obvious Fact.\n This is how a new world is born.  Globalization has occurred through the World Financial System.  The public still loves dollars, and the Fed is ready to print them in the amount needed to buy all the debt obligations.  It is about buying up the assets of the industrial sector of the world economy.\n The unit of calculation is a significant element of the system.  The pandemic is just a cover.  In the near future, the Eurozone will be torn apart by inequality and imbalances in the deepening economic crisis.  Artificial Deficit of financial liquidity.  Subject to a significant overproduction of the money supply.  The printing press is working properly.  Colossal decline in consumption in the real sector.\n The local dictatorship looks quite appropriate against this background, it is soft and fluffy compared to the soulless global financial system controlled by algorithms and robots.  In the financial system, for a long time, decisions are not made by people, therefore, it is impossible to agree with the system.  The decision is made before the algorithms are set up, after programming the algorithms begin to work. >>> #economy #forecast #banks #finance #economics #globalization #economyforecast #global #newworld #pandemic #pandemic2020 #worldchange","NumberOfLikes":30,"Hashtags":["#economy","#forecast","#banks","#finance","#economics","#globalization","#economyforecast","#global","#newworld","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#worldchange"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1597370669,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 14 04:04:29 CEST 2020","Location":"British Virgin Islands"},{"Owner":"bun_butter_jam_deals","CaptionText":"Customized Cases Available @ just \u20B9150\/- \n.\nDM📩\n#customizedcases #mobilecases \n#mobileaccessories #phonecases #coverandcases #covid19 \n#pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":8,"Hashtags":["#customizedcases","#mobilecases","#mobileaccessories","#phonecases","#coverandcases","#covid19","#pandemic2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597370618,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 14 04:03:38 CEST 2020","Location":"Chennai, India"},{"Owner":"rara710","CaptionText":"No Mercy For Fascism!\n#nofascism #nofascistusa #guernicapicasso #suffering #war  www.bbc.com\/culture\/article\/ 20170206-the-artists-who-fought-fascism  #picasso #freedom #streetart #miami #iphoneography #pandemic2020 #iphonephoto #vote2020 #igphoto #arte #streetphotography #streetart #iphonephotography #artistsoninstagram #miamibeach #ig_masterpiece #ig_shutterbugs #ig_great_pics #votersuppression #votolatino #urbanphotography #eattherich #oppression","NumberOfLikes":7,"Hashtags":["#nofascism","#nofascistusa","#guernicapicasso","#suffering","#war","#picasso","#freedom","#streetart","#miami","#iphoneography","#pandemic2020","#iphonephoto","#vote2020","#igphoto","#arte","#streetphotography","#streetart","#iphonephotography","#artistsoninstagram","#miamibeach","#ig_masterpiece","#ig_shutterbugs","#ig_great_pics","#votersuppression","#votolatino","#urbanphotography","#eattherich","#oppression"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Ra Squared on August 13, 2020.","NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597369414,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 14 03:43:34 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"rara710","CaptionText":"#sunset #sunsetphotography #sunsetlover #onlyinmiami  #pandemiclife  #pandemic2020  #streetphotography  #streetart  #iphoneography #iphonephotography #igphoto #ig_shutterbugs #ig_great_pics  #florida #instagood #photooftheday #dope #happy #picoftheday #follow #art #instadaily #friends  #urban #urbanphotography #arte #graffiti","NumberOfLikes":8,"Hashtags":["#sunset","#sunsetphotography","#sunsetlover","#onlyinmiami","#pandemiclife","#pandemic2020","#streetphotography","#streetart","#iphoneography","#iphonephotography","#igphoto","#ig_shutterbugs","#ig_great_pics","#florida","#instagood","#photooftheday","#dope","#happy","#picoftheday","#follow","#art","#instadaily","#friends","#urban","#urbanphotography","#arte","#graffiti"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Ra Squared on August 13, 2020.","NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1597369250,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 14 03:40:50 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"rara710","CaptionText":"#orwell #1984georgeorwell  #antifascism #suffering #war  www.bbc.com\/culture\/article\/20170206-the-artists-who-fought-fascism  #freedom #streetart #miami #iphoneography #pandemic2020 #iphonephoto #vote2020 #igphoto #arte #streetphotography #streetart #iphonephotography #artistsoninstagram #miamibeach #ig_masterpiece #ig_shutterbugs #ig_great_pics #votersuppression #votolatino #urbanphotography #eattherich #oppression","NumberOfLikes":4,"Hashtags":["#orwell","#1984georgeorwell","#antifascism","#suffering","#war","#freedom","#streetart","#miami","#iphoneography","#pandemic2020","#iphonephoto","#vote2020","#igphoto","#arte","#streetphotography","#streetart","#iphonephotography","#artistsoninstagram","#miamibeach","#ig_masterpiece","#ig_shutterbugs","#ig_great_pics","#votersuppression","#votolatino","#urbanphotography","#eattherich","#oppression"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Ra Squared on August 13, 2020.

But every time we think those though are going to take over, we see a little ray of sunshine in the beauty of a sunset, the sound of a laugh, the birth of new little ones that we can't wait to meet and we find comfort in those to help balance the feelings of loss. This time has undoubtedly challenged our sense of joy in the world. But, as we told a friend today, we are determined to continue to smile as much as possible every day, and even if all the smiles are not real, we will continue to do it till we can feel every single one of those smiles.

Já foram arrecadados quatro Natais sem Fome e a crise ainda não alcançou seu auge \u2014 comentou Kiko Afonso, diretor executivo da ONG.\n\nSegundo os cálculos do coordenador, os alimentos já arrecadados são suficientes para beneficiar cerca de 400 mil famílias. Mesmo assim, a demanda é ainda maior e, com o passar do tempo, a situação tende a se agravar. E após o boom inicial, as doações, sobretudo de pessoas físicas, estão diminuindo.\n\n\u2014 No último mês, a gente já percebeu uma queda.

And boy has it been a trip. The last 5 years I have bounced from job to job to job and just hating everything about it... even when I went into my field. The good thing about that job was I met the love of my life @mcelroy.adam but I still didn't like it. Bounced around a few more jobs landing back in retail and then a pandemic happened. As the world was starting to open up again I decided to give it one more shot at the career job thing. I applied and went to a few interviews, and was not chosen for any of them. Then I saw an ad on @indeedworks for a case manager working with homeless families for a company that I worked with before, the YMCA. I sent my resume directly to them and got a response for an interview. I went on three more interviews after that and was selected for the position. I have only been here a month and a half and I see myself making moves here. I can use my skill set from working with kids to helping the adults find stability. And my great listening skills are the icing on the cake. I have never wanted a job so much that everyday I want to wake up and go to work. No day is the same as the last one. I finally found my career where if I made no money off of this, I would still be happy. #homeless #homelessness #homelessshelter #families #familieshelpingfamilies #casemanager #ymca #socialservices #socialserviceworker #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealth #psychology #mastersnumber2 #reflection #lovelife #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":20,"Hashtags":["#homeless","#homelessness","#homelessshelter","#families","#familieshelpingfamilies","#casemanager","#ymca","#socialservices","#socialserviceworker","#mentalhealthawareness","#mentalhealth","#psychology","#mastersnumber2","#reflection","#lovelife","#pandemic2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Jazzy Double H 👑💋⚓🍷☕️🐾🐾 in Massachusetts.

Being aware is important! ⠀\n⠀\nIf you are pregnant, be proactive. Educate yourself about mental health during pregnancy. If you are suffering, talk to a professional. Remember mental health symptoms are common during pregnancy and postpartum, and can be effectively treated.⠀\n⠀\nIt's okay to ask for help. If COVID-19 has taught us anything, it\u2019s that health is not solely the individual's responsibility, but is reliant on community. If you are pregnant or have recently given birth, make a list of concrete ways others can help you. For example, can a family member research support services in your area? Could neighbors cook meals that you could put in your freezer for later? Can you arrange for friends to pick up and do your laundry after the baby is born? It can be hard to ask for help but remind yourself it's a win-win. You get the support you need, and you offer others the opportunity to feel good and wrap around you all at the same time.⠀\n⠀\n#mindfulparenting #globalpandemic #pregnancyjourney #worldpandemic #pregnancybeyond #pregnancyblog #family❤️ #pandemicbaby #pandemiclife #pandemictimes #pregnancytips #pandemicparenting #pandemicpregnancy #pandemicpreparedness #pandemic #pandemic2020 #pregnancydiary #gentleparenting #coronaviruspandemic #familymatters","NumberOfLikes":6,"Hashtags":["#mindfulparenting","#globalpandemic","#pregnancyjourney","#worldpandemic","#pregnancybeyond","#pregnancyblog","#family❤️","#pandemicbaby","#pandemiclife","#pandemictimes","#pregnancytips","#pandemicparenting","#pandemicpregnancy","#pandemicpreparedness","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#pregnancydiary","#gentleparenting","#coronaviruspandemic","#familymatters"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The TNC Psychotherapy Group on August 13, 2020.

Taste and see that the LORD is good! Blessed is the man who takes refuge in him! Fear the LORD, you his saints, for those who fear him have no lack!\nPsalm 34:7-9\n\nFearing God, standing in awe of his power and sovereignty which, in turn, causes us to trust him is where we taste God\u2019s goodness.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting isn\u2019t it that \u2018taste and see that the Lord is good\u2019 is sandwiched right in between the vaccine for anxiety even in the middle of a pandemic:\n𝙛𝙚𝙖𝙧 𝙂𝙤𝙙.\n\nOpen our eyes to see him encamped around us.

Arriving early, the sun was still too high to shoot, but as I paused for a moment, I suddenly felt drawn to Kuta's small lanes.\n\nLike many, I've had numerous experiences on and around these colorful streets; that allows the good, bad, and indifferent to flourish. But sadly, nothing could prepare me for what lay ahead.\n\nWith every step I took, my heart grew heavy as a relentless and uncomfortable feeling began to overwhelm me. Everything I knew, everything I remembered, had seemingly vanished, replaced by the view of a new harsh reality.\n\nA world of cold emptiness surrounded me, an unexpected every day seemingly decimated by an unseen enemy, leaving a silent trail of collateral damage - the very people that made this tiny part of the world so colorful.\n\nThe only thing that seems to remain now are the echoes of the past, a distant memory few believe will be found again.\n\nI stumbled across a man sitting alone, staring into the abyss of a screen designed to connect us. As we chatted, my heart sank further when he shared a parting thought.\n\n\"I don't think COVID will kill me, but I may die of hunger\".\n\nI did manage to watch the sunset, but as the beautiful sphere of hope drifted towards the horizon, I was acutely aware that this reality will rise again tomorrow.\n\nSWIPE FOR MORE PHOTOS➡️➡️\n\n#bali #balivscovid #pandemic2020 #balistrong #balibangkit #balinow #ilovebali #backtonormal #newnormal #balinewnormal #duecovid19 #supportbali #balispirit #hopeful #balivscorona","NumberOfLikes":15,"Hashtags":["#bali","#balivscovid","#pandemic2020","#balistrong","#balibangkit","#balinow","#ilovebali","#backtonormal","#newnormal","#balinewnormal","#duecovid19","#supportbali","#balispirit","#hopeful","#balivscorona"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597326571,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 13 15:49:31 CEST 2020","Location":"Bali"},{"Owner":"littlebigfatfluffymonsterbaby","CaptionText":"This is my mama! \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#littlebigfatfluffymonsterbaby #snickerstheguineapig #babyguineapig #nursingguineapig #babyguineapignursing #guineapigsofinstagram #cavy #pandemic2020 #lockdown2020 #lockdownchronicles #miracleoflife #birth #dayone #guineapiglover #guineapigs #guineapiglife #spoiledguineapigs #lifeofpets #petsofinstagram #animalphotoraphy #guineapigphotography","NumberOfLikes":28,"Hashtags":["#littlebigfatfluffymonsterbaby","#snickerstheguineapig","#babyguineapig","#nursingguineapig","#babyguineapignursing","#guineapigsofinstagram","#cavy","#pandemic2020","#lockdown2020","#lockdownchronicles","#miracleoflife","#birth","#dayone","#guineapiglover","#guineapigs","#guineapiglife","#spoiledguineapigs","#lifeofpets","#petsofinstagram","#animalphotoraphy","#guineapigphotography"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597326179,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 13 15:42:59 CEST 2020","Location":"Long Island - New York"},{"Owner":"note.digo2020","CaptionText":"Acompáñanos este viernes y conozcamos la otra cara de la pandemia, descubre cómo es vivirla desde la trinchera médica #coronavirus #pandemic2020 #pandemiaméxico #quedateencasa #notedigo","NumberOfLikes":2,"Hashtags":["#coronavirus","#pandemic2020","#pandemiaméxico","#quedateencasa","#notedigo"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by NO TE DIGO! on August 13, 2020.
