We live too far from each other to go out and drink a Chaï latte. 🙊 Instead we love to spend time talking on the phone sharing our thoughts about life and discussing society. How we as humans act and behave, and how magical the universe actually is. I met so many \npeople on my journey, but never someone like him. He is a beautiful rare soul with a very unique vision on the world. 🌍💙 It\u2019s no coincidence that I asked him for an interview about love. On Instagram I am bounded to a certain amount of character, so I will share a part here. Make sure to check my website for the whole article, will share the link in my bio. 🔝\nMake sure to check his site: www.bhavnath.com for more inspirational feeds. ✨\n\nAs always I started the interview with the short introduction why I started with the Looks of Love and how the idea was born, followed with my famous question; \u201Cwhat does love mean to you?\u201D. 💕\n\nHe became silent and answered rapidly and so sincere; \u201Ca few years ago I should have needed time to reflect on this question\u201D. For me love is dissolving yourself with everything surrounding you. Being able to experience no sense of separation creates an ultimate feeling of freedom which is an essential element in love. When you emerge with everything you feel a deeper connection with so many things like food, music, nature, even the stars and the moon. ✨🌖\nWhat will make you more grounded and at ease. This form of connection and freedom will make it possible for you to trust the process of life. 🙌🏻\n\nOff course self love is a fundamental key is we speak about love. You need to experience it first. How can you explain to someone how sugar tastes if you never tried it? How can you write a poem or a song about love if you were never able to feel loved? How can you share love if you don\u2019t have a clue what it means and if you\u2019re not capable of giving it to yourself first? 🤷🏻\u200D♀️\n\n... to be continued on my site\n \n©️ @subtle_balance","NumberOfLikes":42,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by \u2022 𝕊𝕦𝕓𝕥𝕝𝕖 𝔹𝕒𝕝𝕒𝕟𝕔𝕖 \u2022 in Somewhere in the Universe. with @bhavnath.

The problem is that we're so busy trying to defend our fears in the act of attacking each other that we've lost sight of the fact that we need to take some responsibility in making a solution possible. \n\nThe bottom line is they're are going to have to get our children back into a learning environment but we also have to understand that it can't be the environment that we have all become formiliar with. There are ways to do this safely but we have to put the effort in the right place in order to make that happen.\n\nIf we're so focused on getting our children back in school by any means necessary the district will be under pressure to give parents what they are asking for (the reopening of school) rather than what our children need (a learning environment that has not cut corners in health and safety requirements to get them through the door).\n\nThere are very effective ways to get our children back into a learning environment where they can have face-to-face instruction where they can be in the presence of other children and they can take advantage of all of the benefits that they have become accustomed to in going to school.\n\nUnderstand that while a pandemic is a school concern it is not with in their area of expertise. They're doing as well as they can be expected to without the help that they need...

I keep saying this over and over in video after video because I want people to snap out of the gaslighting propaganda that has engulfed their mindset. People think they are immune to the poisoning of their mind by this mental manipulation technique.  You are not. Hitler ALMOST TOOK OVER THE WORLD with just the power of radio. Trump has inherited the Death Star of mind manipulation. The digital dictatorship that we have been living under which knows our behaviors better than our own families...and even ourselves.  Even our leader Putin says \u201Cthe nation that leads in AI will be the ruler of the world\u201D \n\nWe are now trapped in a world of mass confusion and hysteria mixed with lies and peppered with our own desperation and fear. Once you come to the realization of what is happening in front of your eyes. You have two choices. Stay silent and afraid and follow the herd to the cliff or begin the process of reeducating yourself on what has been happening to America and it\u2019s people to come to this point in the road of history.  Find the narrative that will help you get through each day. Find a storyline in the facts that helps you to realize the most important lesson of all. \n\nThat we are all in trouble together. Which means we need each other to make it down this road of hell we are on.  And if you can\u2019t understand that simple fact and embrace your truth and humanity. You are already lost.

Why Did They Say The Opposite Of Trump?  https:\/\/youtu.be\/HcZNBaUh-ds\n\nThe U.S intelligence Community has announced that the virus was not manmade and the genetics were not modified, however they will continue investigating. This last part left an open door and could be a sign of deep rooted changes to take place in the intelligence community. A few hours after this announcement, Trump announced that the virus was released from a lab in Wuhan and that the U.S has evidence of this and that he has seen this. He went on to say that the WHO should be ashamed; they are working like a PR agency for China. All this is proof of a history civil war taking place in American behind the scenes between agencies, departments and communities. This has also raised the questions that if the intelligence community is being run from London and the globalist elite.\n\nFollow OTRV On YouTube at: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCarPLihJWmTWgWk8pOPI0tA\/\nFollow OTRV On Twitter At: https:\/\/twitter.com\/OTRVideos\nFollow OTRV On Facebook At: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/offtherecord.otrv.3\n\n#newworldorder #globalist #deepstate #wuhanlab #china🇨🇳 #pandemic2020 #trump #mikepompeo #mikepence #ginahaspel #compensation #andrewhallman #richardallengrennell #intelligencecommunity #josephmaguire","NumberOfLikes":2,"Hashtags":["#newworldorder","#globalist","#deepstate","#wuhanlab","#china🇨🇳","#pandemic2020","#trump","#mikepompeo","#mikepence","#ginahaspel","#compensation","#andrewhallman","#richardallengrennell","#intelligencecommunity","#josephmaguire"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by OTRV on August 13, 2020.

Disaster capitalism is: governments reseizing squatter or involuntarily unoccupied land for redevelopment of high-return endeavours (HURRICANE KATRINA ANYBODY? 2004 TSUNAMI?); or the purchase of property in burst housing bubbles by real estate magnates. The list goes on. Essentially, disaster capitalism refers to the entrenching of capitalist and neoliberal systems in a state whereby the less disadvantaged are the least immobilised. \n.\nI argue that disaster capitalist also refers to narrative. In a society fragmented and disrupted by an unknown and invisible threat, facing recession and austerity, the government swoops in to tighten the belt and worsen the lot for the most disadvantaged.

Who was I if I couldn't go out to work or to college. Who am I without my friends to give me a mirror to look at? Calling up someone to talk to or chatting is very effective for some friends and has helped me tremendously, but what about the ones with whom we thrive on face-to-face social interactions? I miss them too.\n\nI was also so lost and so hurt.\n\nWhat can I *do* now? I tried cooking but that didn't give me the same reward as much as it did for my friends. I played the piano again but left when I started feeling the 'blues'.\n\nAfter a long soul-searching, it hit me! I was always a creative at heart. Also, I am someone who values genuine communal bonding. Plus, I care about adding value. So, how could I combine all three? Quarantine Good Vibes was born!\n\nSince then, I have made good progress in doing the things I care about. I am thankful that I still have my job and that classes have started online. I have also found a purpose that gives me hope and the determination to carry on. I still fumble and panic over taking a step back after taking two steps forward, and I struggle to feel grateful when I'm too down. But then, I sleep, share some of my woes with my friends, have alone time, and  feel light again. It's a battle but I'm gonna get there. \n\nBecause no matter what, quarantine can't lock my mind. It was always up to me.\n\nIf this story touches you or you relate to it in some way, feel free to share in the comments or inbox. \nAnd then, if you want to remind yourself of your inner strength when lockdown times get too rough, BUY sth NOW with this design:\n\nhttps:\/\/bit.ly\/3294qw3\n\nThere are so many items and colors to choose from!  And so many more designs too.\n\nTill then, take my best wishes. ❤","NumberOfLikes":6,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597285775,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 13 04:29:35 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"jokesondave","CaptionText":"Especially with a public phone. #pandemic2020 #covid_19 #fuckyourmask #sarscov2","NumberOfLikes":37,"Hashtags":["#pandemic2020","#covid_19","#fuckyourmask","#sarscov2"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by David Han on August 12, 2020.

If you haven\u2019t been keeping up with my situation here in New York City, then let me briefly tell you. So, back in march I lost my job because of the pandemic. That was really tough because I was self-employed. I spent two months trying to get my PUA (pandemic unemployment benefits) while temporarily on SNAP (welfare) because I lost my job. That was a pain, but I finally got my PUA, thank God. After that I researched and applied to a bunch of companies online. Many declined me and only two accepted my application. I chose to go with the company that I liked better. So then I got my first interview. The first interview was by phone. After that, I was asked to get interviewed again but face-to-face in a virtual setting. I did that and was told that I\u2019ll get feedback in a day or two. When I didn\u2019t hear back from my recruiter after two days, I sent her a follow up email asking about the postion. Later the next day she got back to me, said sorry for the delay and was waiting for more information from the hiring team. She then said that she\u2019d call me later on today. So, I waited and waited while praying to God that I get the job, because I really like it and need it! Then around 3:30PM my recruiter called me and said I\u2019ve got the job!!! SubhanAllah! Glory be to God! Alhamdulillah! I thanked God and then told my recruiter how happy I was to have been hired!!! So, after many months of worrying about how I was going to provide for my family and I, and after a lot of prayers and trust in the Creator, He has made a way for me. Alhamdulillah, praise be to God. \nFor those of you who have been with me through this crazy time, thank you. I really appreciate your kind words, encouragement and support. If you haven\u2019t followed me on my account @lionbeardkhannyc then I invite you to do so. I\u2019m still doing NYC walking videos, showing you around New York City. I still plan on writing\/journaling what\u2019s going on here and with my situation. The only addition is that I post videos and goofy things here and there, and share with you more about myself. Again, thank you and thank you for reading!...

She rolls around on the concrete floor of her cage, pulling at tufts of hair in frustration, looking depressed, lonely and traumatised. We all know what it is like to be in lockdown but imagine that for 32 years. If there has ever been a time where we say enough is enough it must be now.\nSo please spread the word, the more people that know about this, the more we can save Bua Noi.

I can\u2019t believe these two are in first grade and TK now. Sad for Livi for missing that experience of being in an actual school on her very first day of school. Kind of a crazy start though- first Lulu started complaining of a tooth ache, couldn\u2019t log them both on, school had technical difficulties so we had to log on a different way, and after finally logging in successfully we had to catch up quick on whatever the class was doing. I was going back and forth between the two of them like a freakin DJ. I was by myself since Adrian already had his hands full. Decided to make this morning even more hectic by having them wear their school uniforms for photos.
