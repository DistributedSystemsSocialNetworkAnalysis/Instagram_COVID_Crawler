The measure of an individual, or organization, is how one responds to adversity. I believe we have all responded well and is a credit to each individual. 2020 has presented, and will continue to present, challenges but also opportunities. Greater opportunities for online courses. Greater opportunities for long distance learning. Greater opportunities to learn more computer skills. And, perhaps, greater opportunities to spend more time with family. \u2060\nAs long as each of us continues to respond to these ongoing challenges in a similar manner to what we have so far, I believe we will all look back on this year as one of the most memorable years of our lives. If that is the case, and it likely is, then we should continue to strive to have those memories as ones of success in conquering challenges, memorable self-reflection for when future hardships arise in years and decades to come, and the importance of friends, family, and colleagues in helping each other overcome difficulty.\u2060\n\u2060\nThank you all again for coming together and rising to the challenge and making this summer session a great success. I, and the rest of the G-MEO team, look forward to hopefully having many of you in our Fall 2020 classes as well.\"\u2060\n\u2060\n-- Dr. Andy Guth, American University\u2060\n\u2060\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\u2060\n\u2060\n#summer2020 #onlineclass #gmeosummer #college #studyonline #summerstudy #summerplan #summerlife #collegemust #studyinus #summeronline #studyathome  #socialdistance #professor #teachingabroad #teachinginchina #teachinchina #faculty #americanuniversity #university #summerreview\u2060","NumberOfLikes":4,"Hashtags":["#summer2020","#onlineclass","#gmeosummer","#college","#studyonline","#summerstudy","#summerplan","#summerlife","#collegemust","#studyinus","#summeronline","#studyathome","#socialdistance","#professor","#teachingabroad","#teachinginchina","#teachinchina","#faculty","#americanuniversity","#university","#summerreview\u2060"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by G-MEO | Study & Intern Abroad on August 22, 2020.

I was in complete disbelief, my stomach churned and my heart sank. Following that, panic and anxiety attack kicked in. How bad will my symptoms going to be? Will I end up in the ICU? Whaaa, Am I going to die? Did I infect my family?\n\nIt was weeks of battle and anxiety. But, I\u2019m glad & blessed that I finally finished my quarantine and back to work again. I didn\u2019t plan on sharing this publicly, as I am the type of person who doesn\u2019t share problems on social media. However, after much consideration, I figured it will be a good idea to share this to the public with the hope to educate the group of people who still think covid-19 is fake, baloney or hoax. From my experience; I\u2019ll tell you this, coronavirus is 100% REAL! This invisible virus is definitely out there infecting, and killing millions of people around the globe. This virus not only has the capability to destroy you physically, but also leaves a deep psychological impact, emotional rollercoaster topped with social stigma. So, please take matters seriously as times are uncertain and not much is known about this virus. Believe it or not, this virus is not racist. No matter what color you are, how healthy, and how old or young you are, it can still infect and possibly kill you or someone you know. I know we\u2019re reaching a point where we all feel like the situation has been going on forever. But, time is passing and it will be over soon if we we do our part... \n\nAs far as how I got infected, it\u2019s definite that I got it from a covid(+) colleague. However, to avoid complications, lets just say it\u2019s indefinite, since it became a political debate. One colleague said I got it from my families & friends. Another colleague think I got it from the restroom or from our patients, and lastly the other one said I got it from the supermarket etc. So, let\u2019s just leave it at that. \n\nWhat matters now is that I am fully recovered, vertical and functional. THANKS A MILLION to my families and friends for helping me get through quarantine, you know who y\u2019all are❤️, and above all God for not giving up on me. I hope and pray not to get this virus again 🙏","NumberOfLikes":35,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":16,"Timestamp":1598120517,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 20:21:57 CEST 2020","Location":"San Diego, California"},{"CaptionText":"This is what I do to maintain social distance!!! 😆Carry large sticks!!!\n#socialdistancing #socialdistance #frenchie #frenchbulldog #fransebulldog #frenchbully #frenchbullie #frenchielove #frenchielife #frenchieworld #frenchiesofinstagram #frenchiesoverload #frenchiesociety #frenchbulldogsofinstagram #dogsofinstagram #bulldog #adopteddog #rescuebulldog #adoptdontshop #gauitmijnaura #afstand","NumberOfLikes":13,"Hashtags":["#socialdistancing","#socialdistance","#frenchie","#frenchbulldog","#fransebulldog","#frenchbully","#frenchbullie","#frenchielove","#frenchielife","#frenchieworld","#frenchiesofinstagram","#frenchiesoverload","#frenchiesociety","#frenchbulldogsofinstagram","#dogsofinstagram","#bulldog","#adopteddog","#rescuebulldog","#adoptdontshop","#gauitmijnaura","#afstand"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @_mr___meatball_ on August 22, 2020.

Fakat Capitol Avm'ye gidip daha fazla fastfood yemektense hand-made bir burger yemek isterim diyenler için Ora Burger incelememiz geliyor. 😊\n\nOra Burger'in uzun dönem önünden geçtim fakat o zamanlar öğrenci olmam sebebiyle hiç girmeye cesaret edemedim. Bir gün kapısına astıkları belli saatler arasındaki indirimli menüleri ile ben de hemen denemek için içeri girdim. Şu anda da İstanbul'a geldiğim gibi ilk uğradığım yer oldu. Ora Burger'in köftesi son derece lezzetli ve ekmeği yumuşacık geliyor. Tüm burgerler menü şeklinde servis ediliyor. Yanında baharatlı patates ve içeceğinizi ücretsiz olarak alabiliyorsunuz. Pandemi öncesinde yemeğiniz hazırlanırken masanıza yer fıstığı ikram ediliyordu fakat şu an yok. Hatta masaya servis tamamen kalkmış. Oturduğunuz zaman masanın üstünde bulunan karekodlar ile siparişinizi veriyorsunuz. Panoda masa numarası yandığı zaman ise gidip alabiliyorsunuz. Bir tür self-servis sistemi uygulanıyor. Eskiden ev yapımı ayran ve ice-tea seçeneği vardı ve son derece lezzetliydi. Pandemi bitince muhakkak ev yapımı ice-tea içmeye gelmelisiniz.\n\nOra Burger hizmet ve ilgi son derece yüksek. Bir çok defa gittim ve bu zamana kadar hiçbir sorun yaşamadım. Mekanın tasarımı ise son derece ferah. Yüksek tavanlı geniş bir yapısı var. Bahçe kısmı da bulunuyor fakat yol kenarında olması sebebiyle bahçesinin fazla rahat olduğunu söyleyemeyeceğim. Hand-made burger restoranlarında her yerde fazlaca bulunan inek figürlerini ben çok hoş bulmuyorum. Burada da hiç yok diyemem ama abartılmamış. Geçen yıllardaki kampanyası devam etmiyor ve burger ücretleri 35-40 TL civarında. Umarım kampanyalar tekrar başlar ve biz de seve seve faydalanırız. \n\n#oraburger #steak #burger #cheeseburger #instafood #istanbul #altunizade #uskudar #üsküdar #food #foodphotography #dinner #sunday #funday #instasummer #meat #socialdistance #distance","NumberOfLikes":20,"Hashtags":["#oraburger","#steak","#burger","#cheeseburger","#instafood","#istanbul","#altunizade","#uskudar","#üsküdar","#food","#foodphotography","#dinner","#sunday","#funday","#instasummer","#meat","#socialdistance","#distance"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1598091780,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 12:23:00 CEST 2020","Location":"Ora's Steak & Burgers"},{"CaptionText":"THE BIGGER THE BETTER!!!!!! \n\n70\"-$1500\n\nThe Specs:\n\n1. 4K ULTRA HD SMART LED TV\n2.

In ieder geval weten we dat 3 factoren van belang zijn bij overdracht door grote druppels: de hoeveelheid virus die iemand bij zich draagt (viral load), de duur van de blootstelling (hoe lang ben je dichtbij elkaar) en de intensiteit (direct in iemands gezicht hoesten, of rustig ademen).\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nDe rol van aerosolen (de kleine druppels die vrijkomen en die langer in een ruimte blijven hangen) bij overdracht van het coronavirus is een zeer uitgebreid besproken onderwerp van de afgelopen tijd. Het is aannemelijk dat aerosolen een rol spelen bij de verspreiding. Om verspreiding door aerosolen te voorkomen is het belangrijk om goed te ventileren zodat de druppels kunnen weg waaien, of om buiten af te spreken, daar waaien aerosolen makkelijk weg.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nMoeten we dan de 1,5m afstand loslaten zoals sommige mensen betogen? Nee, ook de grotere druppels kunnen virus bevatten. Moeten we altijd, onder alle omstandigheden 1,5m afstand houden? Daarover is het laatste woord nog niet gezegd en ik denk dat we dat onder sommige omstandigheden los kunnen laten, zoals in het volgende voorbeeld. Maar voorlopig geldt het advies: in principe 1,5m afstand houden.","NumberOfLikes":29,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":6,"Timestamp":1598081010,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 09:23:30 CEST 2020","Location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands"},{"CaptionText":"アトラクション乗る時もソーシャルディスタンスする私たちはもう完璧😤\n\n#universalstudiosjapan #ユニバ\n#制服ユニバ　#恐竜 \n#socialdistance #ソーシャルディスタンス　\n#jkの素敵な思い出 #青春の1ページ","NumberOfLikes":102,"Hashtags":["#universalstudiosjapan","#ユニバ","#制服ユニバ","#恐竜","#socialdistance","#ソーシャルディスタンス","#jkの素敵な思い出","#青春の1ページ"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598080987,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 09:23:07 CEST 2020","Location":"ユニバーサル・スタジオ・ジャパン \/ Universal Studios Japan (USJ)"},{"CaptionText":"Tüm hijyen önlemlerinin alındığı odalarımızda keyifli bir konaklama deneyimi yaşayın! ✨\u2063\n. \u2063\n. \u2063\nEnjoy a pleasant stay in our rooms where all hygiene measures are taken! ✨\u2063\n\u2063\n#radissonblutrabzon #radissonblu #radissonmoments #Trabzon #Türkiye #Turkey #blacksea #boztepe #karadenizgroup #hotel #room #feelslikehome #journey #travel #seyahat #memoriesneverdie #sightseeings #tourists #tourism #seaview #cityview #bluview #sağlık #health #sosyalmesafe #socialdistance #dezenfeksiyon #disinfection #hijyen #hygiene","NumberOfLikes":28,"Hashtags":["#radissonblutrabzon","#radissonblu","#radissonmoments","#Trabzon","#Türkiye","#Turkey","#blacksea","#boztepe","#karadenizgroup","#hotel","#room","#feelslikehome","#journey","#travel","#seyahat","#memoriesneverdie","#sightseeings","#tourists","#tourism","#seaview","#cityview","#bluview","#sağlık","#health","#sosyalmesafe","#socialdistance","#dezenfeksiyon","#disinfection","#hijyen","#hygiene"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Radisson Blu Hotel Trabzon in Radisson Blu Hotel, Trabzon.
