We practice certain disinfection procedures blah blah. Sabi nga nila better safe than sorry. We even closed our store and the catering doesn\u2019t accept clients for full service yet.

First off, you can\u2019t compare it to Disney; nothing can, but Dollywood has its own unique & special charm that really can\u2019t be missed. Similar to Disney, though, DW offers TimeSavers (like Fast Passes), though you can get 10 or unlimited (prices vary). If you are staying at the DreamMore Resort on site, however, you get 10 for free, which was more than enough. Another perk for staying on site is a complimentary shuttle to both DW and Splash Country, a special entrance to skip the line, and COVID screening prior to leaving the resort so you don\u2019t have to do it at the park. Let\u2019s also talk about the rides. Y\u2019all, I have only been to Disney for the last fifteen years (minus a trip or two to Six Flags over Georgia years ago). I forgot what actual thrill rides are! Lightning Rod, for instance, is the world\u2019s fastest wooden rollercoaster, topping out at 73 MPH along with a nice 165\u2019 drop. I will never again find the start of Rockin\u2019 Rollercoaster stressful 🤣 Seriously though, if you can\u2019t get to Disney right now & are relatively close to DW, definitely take a nice weekend to explore East Tennessee & the mountains. I\u2019m already ready to get back up there! 🦋 Also, if you are concerned about safety, DW is on top of cleaning, social distancing, and employees were quick to catch people violating the masks on rule. They have designated \u201Cmask free zones\u201D and, of course, you can take them off while dining. Otherwise, you keep them on - even on rides 🦋\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#dollywood #dollyparton #dreammore #dreammoreresort #pigeonforge #sevierville #umbrellaart #easttennessee #dollypartonchallenge #dollywoodinsiders #exploretn #themepark #maskson #themeparkphotography #socialdistance #covidtravel #lightningrod #rollercoasterenthusiast #rollercoaster #rollercoasters #familytravel #familytime #vacaygoals #vacayvibes","NumberOfLikes":67,"Hashtags":["#dollywood","#dollyparton","#dreammore","#dreammoreresort","#pigeonforge","#sevierville","#umbrellaart","#easttennessee","#dollypartonchallenge","#dollywoodinsiders","#exploretn","#themepark","#maskson","#themeparkphotography","#socialdistance","#covidtravel","#lightningrod","#rollercoasterenthusiast","#rollercoaster","#rollercoasters","#familytravel","#familytime","#vacaygoals","#vacayvibes"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597153700,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 11 15:48:20 CEST 2020","Location":"Dollywood"},{"Owner":"coosacatchco","CaptionText":"Fishermen prefer social distancing.","NumberOfLikes":11,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Coosa Catch Co. on August 11, 2020.

This number is very alarming as we approach schools reopening. 😰And keep in mind, as alarming as 97k sounds, this number is likely an *underrepresentation* of the actual pediatric COVID-19 infections. 😥 So we must be extra cautious. We hardly test children, as their symptoms often mimic the common cold or are hardly noticeable, and hardly trigger the same sense of urgency for testing as an adult. But children are still #susceptible to this virus, they can still fall #ill from this virus, and they can #die from this virus, although they are much less likely to suffer poor outcomes when compared to the elderly. Most important of all - they can #spread this virus - and they may play a much larger role than anticipated in this pandemic. \n\nI repeat: We are not out of the woods yet! 🤒 We must stay strong, continue to follow the CDC guidelines to #wearamask, #socialdistance, and limit indoor social gatherings. \n\nLet\u2019s take care of each other, America 🙏🏼❤️ let\u2019s reach across the aisle and remember that Public Health is #bipartisan. 🤝✌️🦠 Let\u2019s depoliticize public health, and carry our country across the finish line! 🇺🇸 \n\n#covid19 #erdoctor #publichealth #depoliticizepublichealth #emergencymedicine #bipartisan #globalhealth #foxnews #foxandfriends","NumberOfLikes":180,"Hashtags":["#susceptible","#ill","#die","#spread","#wearamask,","#socialdistance,","#bipartisan.","#covid19","#erdoctor","#publichealth","#depoliticizepublichealth","#emergencymedicine","#bipartisan","#globalhealth","#foxnews","#foxandfriends"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Dr. Natasha Kathuria on August 10, 2020 tagging @natashakathuriamd, and @foxnews.
