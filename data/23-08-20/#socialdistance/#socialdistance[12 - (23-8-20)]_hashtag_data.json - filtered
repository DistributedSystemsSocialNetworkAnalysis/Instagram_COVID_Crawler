They are often depicted walking off a cliff with a tsunami-like wave rolling in the distance. Symbolically, The Fool represents deep trust or faith in the universe, spontaneity, and a new phase.

I see people look past me and keep their distance on the street, but in the park, they don't mind as much. I can't seem to smile through this mask. I can't seem to feel the same human connection I once felt at a concert or in public spaces. Now if I stand too close I'm essentially a murderer. My fleeting opinions or thoughts are forever cemented on the internet. A pinhole-sized camera on my iPhone watches me change clothes, a few moments later Instagram flashes an ad for a new bra. Racists, pedophiles, and Christians keep quiet these days. SJW's are the new preachers. The Tik-Tok generation dances their way into a meme filled apocalypse. But isn't \"the end\" a new beginning? The beginning of what? I do not know. #2020 \u2022\u2022\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n#drawing #tarotcard #pencildrawing #mask #distance #socialdistance #police #selfportrait #thefool #art #draw #apocolypse #thoughts #tiktok #sjw #riot","NumberOfLikes":95,"Hashtags":["#2020","#drawing","#tarotcard","#pencildrawing","#mask","#distance","#socialdistance","#police","#selfportrait","#thefool","#art","#draw","#apocolypse","#thoughts","#tiktok","#sjw","#riot"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":7,"Timestamp":1597000669,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 09 21:17:49 CEST 2020","Location":"Athens, Georgia"},{"CaptionText":"#summer\n#flowers\n#fushia\n#lipstick\n#socialdistance\n#homelife\n#postivevibesonly","NumberOfLikes":32,"Hashtags":["#summer","#flowers","#fushia","#lipstick","#socialdistance","#homelife","#postivevibesonly"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Shamila Mazhar on August 09, 2020.

By any measure, they are experts in exactly what is needed right now.\u2060\n\u2060\nFollowing the June re-opening, only 3 of our 2,200 beauty professionals contracted Covid. That's a 0.1% infection rate versus the 1.0% infection rate for the general public in CA. \u2060\n\u2060\nOther salons are reporting similarly-low numbers of infections. It's been well-reported that in Missouri, two hairdressers with covid serviced 139 clients and not one client was infected.\u2060","NumberOfLikes":136,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":22,"Timestamp":1596999962,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 09 21:06:02 CEST 2020","Location":"Wilshire Federal Building"},{"CaptionText":"Another custom!! 24x36 canvas","NumberOfLikes":67,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Paints by Ziya on August 09, 2020.","NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1596999904,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 09 21:05:04 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Our salons are safe.

I am Dr. Hina Talib, teen doc & toddler mom. A family #selfcaresunday post this morning to highlight the importance of perspective taking. \u2009\u2009\n\u2009\u2009\n👩🏻\u200D⚕️I will admit I lean to over-thinking the parent load, the physician load &, as @_happyasamother describes so well in her work, the invisible load of motherhood. So today, I wanted to practice perspective taking myself & encourage you to do as well for all the peas in your pandemic pods, partners too. \u2009\u2009\n\u2009\u2009\n🧠A neuroscientist recently explained \"load theory\" in an article, that I thought was really helpful. \u2009\u2009\n\u2009\u2009\n\u201CWe have limited brain capacity, and focusing on one thing requires filtering out other stuff. If our short-term memories\u2014or our visual perceptions\u2014are overloaded with more info than we can handle, we struggle to distinguish what matters, we become forgetful, and we\u2019re easily distracted.\u201D\u2009\u2009\n\u2009\u2009\n\u201CIf your life was complicated before Covid-19, consider how much more you\u2019re keeping track of now. Was that person six feet away? Did you just touch your face without washing your hands? Are your kids completing their home schooling? Are your boomer parents ignoring social distancing guidelines again? Does your home look presentable for that Zoom call? Is that Arizona outbreak going to cause a second wave in your city? Did you miss your online grocery delivery slot? Do other people secretly think your brain has turned to mush, too?\u201D\u2009\u2009\n\u2009\u2009\n\u201CThe more our working memories are filled with these powerful emotional thoughts, the less capacity we have to distinguish important work tasks in front of us from the cacophony of everyday distractions that we\u2019re usually able to tune out.\u201D\u2009\u2009\n\u2009\u2009\n👉🏼So, what can we do about our collective mushy brains? I have shared in the past, tips to help teens facing pandemic fatigue, they apply for all of us actually. Validating this load, giving ourselves a break, repriotizitng our goals, mindfulness or other coping skills practice, movement, finding meaning and of course therapy are all options. \u2009\u2009\n\u2009\u2009\n👩🏻\u200D⚕️Much more coming from me this week! School reopening is definitely on my mind, will share your questions tonight.  Only one way through this, directly & collectively 💕","NumberOfLikes":616,"Hashtags":["#selfcaresunday"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":65,"Timestamp":1596973852,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 09 13:50:52 CEST 2020","Location":"New York, New York"},{"CaptionText":"About ready for some #socialdistance #Flinthills #LaGrind #gravelgrindinggoingon","NumberOfLikes":60,"Hashtags":["#socialdistance","#Flinthills","#LaGrind","#gravelgrindinggoingon"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by LaGrind_GravelStageRace on August 09, 2020.

The show is called Wide Open and it opens August 15th to September 13th. \n\nThis series, titled peep, critiques the closeness individuals feel towards celebrity via social media posts. These photographs were taken through a peephole installed within a reflective box that peers into the social media accounts of multiple celebrities.  They show glimpses of celebrity life while individuals in quarantine try to mirror these emotions to feel the leisure of celebrity. \n\nThis leisure is an unattainable microcosm surrounded by infinite dead space. No matter how much individuals wish to mirror celebrity they will not attain that leisure due in part to not only an absence of commodity, but also the worldbuilding of a legal\/political economy that excludes the quarantines masses.  \n\nSo, come by see the work and take a queue from Lady Liberty when you get there and social distance.\n\n#artlaw #artlawyer #leisure #wideopen #photography #design #installationart #rightofpublicity #privacy #peep #copyright #publicfigure #socialdistance #nyc","NumberOfLikes":22,"Hashtags":["#artlaw","#artlawyer","#leisure","#wideopen","#photography","#design","#installationart","#rightofpublicity","#privacy","#peep","#copyright","#publicfigure","#socialdistance","#nyc"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1596915268,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 08 21:34:28 CEST 2020","Location":"BWAC Brooklyn Waterfront Artists Coalition"},{"CaptionText":"What a beautiful morning.

Although I have him as a sleeper to watch out for based on his ADP and his production last year, the fantasy community is well aware of this stud. Many have him as a breakout candidate, and that\u2019s also accurate, but this post is affirming him as a sleeper for his value. \nAs a rookie last year, Johnson led the Steelers in targets (92), receptions (59), and touchdowns (5)! He was only a measly 55 yards behind JuJu for most receiving yards, and he played in all 16 games and started in 12 of them. \nIn no way am I saying he will do the same this season, as JuJu is due for an uptick in production and he has a solid rapport with Big Ben. Eric Ebron and Chase Claypool will also take away some targets. With that being said, Diontae Johnson gives his fantasy owners great upside, and could easily be a flex or low end RB2. He\u2019s great after the catch as well, so I\u2019d especially target him in PPR formats.\nThe Steelers are absolute juggernauts at producing and developing high end WR talents. They did it again with Johnson. Be excited about him this season because he\u2019s going to light it up again and show everyone last season\u2019s numbers weren\u2019t a fluke. \n\n🎥 Sports Productions (YouTube) \n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n#DiontaeJohnson  #WR2 #steelers #Pittsburgh #nfl #fantasy #YourFantasyDoctor #nflmeme #SleeperoftheWeek #FantasyHelp #breakout #wewantfootballback #COVID19 #socialdistance #SteelCurtain #BigBen #Toledo #JUJU #footballplayers #league #highlights #americanfootball #sportsclips #footballvideos #Coldweatherfootball #fantasyhelp #footballtutor #mockdrafthelp #AFCNorth","NumberOfLikes":66,"Hashtags":["#DiontaeJohnson","#WR2","#steelers","#Pittsburgh","#nfl","#fantasy","#YourFantasyDoctor","#nflmeme","#SleeperoftheWeek","#FantasyHelp","#breakout","#wewantfootballback","#COVID19","#socialdistance","#SteelCurtain","#BigBen","#Toledo","#JUJU","#footballplayers","#league","#highlights","#americanfootball","#sportsclips","#footballvideos","#Coldweatherfootball","#fantasyhelp","#footballtutor","#mockdrafthelp","#AFCNorth"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":16,"Timestamp":1596911880,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 08 20:38:00 CEST 2020","Location":"Heinz Field"},{"CaptionText":"This is what happens when you are home for so long.
