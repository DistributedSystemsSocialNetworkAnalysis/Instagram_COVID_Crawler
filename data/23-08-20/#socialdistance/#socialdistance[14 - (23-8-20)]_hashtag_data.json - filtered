Dan jangan menyimpan tepung di tempat yang terkena sinar matahari langsung atau pun terlalu panas, karena akan cepat sekali mengubah kualitas tepung.\n\nSetiap membuka kantong untuk mengambil tepung, ambil jumlah yang diperlukan dengan sendok yang kering dan bersih lalu segera tutup kembali.\n\nSebaiknya jangan mencampur tepung yang sudah lama di dalam kontainer dengan tepung yang baru dibuka dari kemasannya.

Especially working in an office with a cast of characters, highlighting the many different types of relationships that evolve in the workplace.\n\nWhen I think about what I miss about pre-COVID work, it\u2019s not necessarily the conference room, the office kitchen (although, sadly, there are many less @traderjoes snacks in my life), or the subway (heyyy, @mtanyctransit). It\u2019s the people. The room for connection and discovery together in person.\n\nIn her @theatlantic article, Nicole Mo writes about the significance of work friendships and the different ways people are continuing to foster these remotely, or let them go. She states, \u201CWithout gathering daily in a communal space, co-workers will no longer share the proximity that once created low-effort, high-reward friendships.\u201D \n\nPeople react to this situation differently, with some noting the importance of these relationships and @gallup research finding \u201Cthat a close work friend increases fulfillment, productivity, and even company loyalty.\u201D On the other hand, for others, the \u201Cremote workplace with less built-in socialization is a welcome change, lessening the pressure to devote emotional as well as professional energy to their job.\u201D\n\nWhat do you think?

He recalled the Andhra Pradesh microfinance crisis to buttress his rationale. \u201COnce you told people don't pay, it became hard to get them back into the payment habit because they have not saved any money. They did not have any money.\u201D\n\nOn May 22, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) extended the moratorium on term loan equated monthly instalments (EMIs) by another three months, until August 31. The moratorium, which was launched on March 1, was aimed at providing relief from the financial crises seeded by the coronavirus pandemic. On the fears of a spike in non-performing loans once the loan moratorium term ends, Rajan said sometimes you recover more on your loan by writing down your debt and recognising losses. \u201CMore than private sector banks, public sector banks are worried about writing down their debts as they have to face various enquiries.\u201D\n\n#raghuramrajan #Interviews #EconomyOnTrack #moratorium #Banks #banking #loan #vakreports #vakloans #economictimes #economy #lockdown #lockdownlife #lockdown4 #makeinindia #india #pandamic #socialdistancing #socialdistance #socialdistancing2020 #socialmediamarketing #socialmedia","NumberOfLikes":23,"Hashtags":["#raghuramrajan","#Interviews","#EconomyOnTrack","#moratorium","#Banks","#banking","#loan","#vakreports","#vakloans","#economictimes","#economy","#lockdown","#lockdownlife","#lockdown4","#makeinindia","#india","#pandamic","#socialdistancing","#socialdistance","#socialdistancing2020","#socialmediamarketing","#socialmedia"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by VAK Reports on August 06, 2020.

We spent three days stopping in every major city, and some minor cities along the way. Denver was by far my favorite, if you must know. It was one of the most memorable trips I\u2019ve ever taken. And sitting here on my couch, scrolling through memories of adventuring new places really has me missing a friend-packed car full of luggage and snacks. \n\nKev and I had a trip planned for a friends birthday to go to New Orleans, LA back in March, and obviously we had to cancel. This slowed time in the world has had an astronomical impact on so many people, and while it\u2019s important to be grateful for where you are, right where time finds your feet in the world, I would be lying if I said I am not itching to adventure again.\n\nUntil then, I\u2019ll keep taking naps with the pups and enjoying the quiet, loving space I get to call home🏡\n\n#graphicdesign #graphicdesigner #graphicart #graphicartist #linedrawing #procreate #art #artist #VW #car #cardrawing #travel #travelart #memories #loveoftravel #tbt","NumberOfLikes":33,"Hashtags":["#socialdistance","#stayhome","#graphicdesign","#graphicdesigner","#graphicart","#graphicartist","#linedrawing","#procreate","#art","#artist","#VW","#car","#cardrawing","#travel","#travelart","#memories","#loveoftravel","#tbt"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @anna.the.arter on August 06, 2020.","NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1596716777,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 06 14:26:17 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"The pets in our care depend on us, we  can\u2019t risk getting sick and being quarantined.

In the yin-yang dichotomy, yin represents things that are slower and less aggressive. Often poses are held for several minutes, allowing the connective tissue to begin to release and creating a greater opening in the body. Props are used to support various parts of the body to make the poses easier to relax into.⠀\n.⠀\nYin yoga is the perfect compliment to a busy life because it forces you to really slow down. It can be mentally challenging for yogis who have trouble shutting their minds off, but practicing yoga asanas is all about finding a moving meditation and slowing down the thoughts moving through your consciousness. Sometimes a slow yin class is exactly what we need to move away from the crazy pace of modern life and to find stillness.⠀\n.⠀\nSign up for YIN tomorrow online at 6:30pm! ⠀\n🔸⠀\n🔸⠀\n🔸⠀\n#hotyoga #hotyogahouston #theoriginal #acceptnosubstitutes #ihp #infernohotpilates #socialdistance #virtualconnection #letsstaytogether","NumberOfLikes":15,"Hashtags":["#hotyoga","#hotyogahouston","#theoriginal","#acceptnosubstitutes","#ihp","#infernohotpilates","#socialdistance","#virtualconnection","#letsstaytogether"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Hot Yoga Houston on August 06, 2020.

Poikkeuksellisesti kuva otettu kaappauksena Facebookista, ei ole minun ottama. Mutta sopi niin hyvin tämän päivän aamuiseen pohdintaan. \n\nOlen havainnut sen, että ihmiset eivät ole enää läsnä. Tänään todistin hotellin aamupalalla tätä hyvin selkeästi. Viereisessä pöydässä oli noin 25v pariskunta. He istuivat hiljaa, tuijottaen puhelintaan yli kaksikymmentä minuuttia putkeen. Ei mitään kommunikointia keskenään. Lopulta mies otti kontaktin, kosketti naista käsivarteen ja sanoi jotain ennen kuin lähti hakemaan lisää ruokaa. Nainen oli kuin zombi, kun katsoi ylös, katsoi hetken ja otti sitten puhelimen takaisin melkein nenään kiinni. Surullista. \n\nSamaa olen havainnut monesti kahviloissa, ravintoloissa jne. Sekä pariskuntien, että ystävien kesken. Miksi lähteä ollenkaan toisen kanssa johonkin, jos on sitten kuitenkin omassa valomaailmassa?\n\nItsekin syyllistyn puhelimen räpläämiseen esimerkiksi, kun odotan ravintolassa ruokaa. Mutta pidän tärkeänä, että olen läsnä silti. Eli esimerkiksi puolison kanssa jutellaan uutisista mitä luetaan tai näytetään toiselle hauskoja videoita. \n\nEn tiedä onko sekään hyvä, mutta ehkä parempi kuin täysin mennä eri ulottuvuuteen seuralaisen kanssa?

They talked about the 7-year-old German Shepherd who had the Coronavirus and possibly died from it. The owners saw the sign of COVID in their dog and was able to get him tested. The dog, Buddy, was tested twice, the first time the results came back positive and the second time he tested negative, but he was still sick. Buddy was suspected to have lymphoma that they found in his blood work. They are not sure if the Coronavirus made the cancer worse, or if he died from COVID. The reason they are not sure what Buddy died from, is because he did not have a necropsy (\u201Cis the examination of an animal after death\u201D) (no fault to the owners).\n:\nThis was just a brief summary of what they talked about. If you would like to watch the whole video to get more information on buddy and dogs getting COVID head over to @thezendogla to watch.
