This is a quick service that provides a better look at your internal eye health, without dilating your eyes.\n.\n.\nWith these images, we are able to evaluate the retinal health to a much greater extent, and have an image to compare to in the future. Although most of the time the images show a healthy retina, we have found problems ranging from minor to severe in hundreds of patients, and many times without any warning or symptoms. The retina is the light sensitive portion at the back of the eye that transmits the signals of light from the world to your brain so you can see. This is the part of the eye that can suffer from macular degeneration, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, melanoma, retinal holes\/detachments, genetic disorders, and several other conditions.\n.\n.\nThis technology also promotes social distancing? Patients spend much less time in the office and much less time at close distance with the doctor compared to manual viewing with eye dilation. We feel this is an especially good method to use during this time of the COVID-19 pandemic. As with all the other procedures at our office, masks by staff and patient are kept on and the instruments, chairs and counters are all sanitized between each patient.","NumberOfLikes":293,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Jasmine Chen, OD., FAAO in Novato, California.
