Also @malonegareth for persevering with all those involved and for making something musical and magical. \nThe CD is available to buy for £5.99 and the money raised goes to the nhs charities. Please buy if you can- a piece of history ! \nDownloads are available but so many many more need to be bought for the price of one EP. \nI\u2019ve bought one so will have to sit in my car to listen as my only CD player! \n\nPS I\u2019m happy to autograph copies bought.

This session will not say what is right or wrong, as we believe that is something each family needs to decide for themselves. Rather, our panelists will discuss ways we can keep our family healthy, how to protect children's mental and emotional health, and how we can keep our own sanity amidst what is sure to be a crazy year (regardless of the decision your family has made). This event is free and open to the public and we hope you can join us! \u2060\n\u2060\nWednesday evening we will be joined by Dr. Susan Lovelle of @premierewellness for an Expert Q&A about Stress, Hormones & Immunity. This session will provide information on using a truly holistic approach to lower STRESS, boost the IMMUNE SYSTEM, manage INFLAMMATION, BALANCE hormones, and feel as healthy as possible in these unprecedented times.\u2060\nThis is a member event.

So it only seems fitting to introduce For The Love of Flowers. Gorgeous blooms are now available with all our boards. Here\u2019s how it works: Tell us your fav color-mine\u2019s orange (we might add another color that complements it) and we take it from there. We then hand select the freshest stems, wrap them in burlap, cello and hand tie with raffia. With nearly 35-40 stems and often 6 different flowers, these bouqs are a show stopper. And no 2 arrangements are ever the same. Who doesn\u2019t love fresh flowers?\n\nThis bouquet features cockscomb, gomphrena, calla lilies, gerber daisies, roses, and French tulips. This beaut is available for $75.\n\nWe love to customize flowers and will create innovative arrangements using your vases.

We place an overemphasis on showing up fully for those who ask it of us but what happens when we don't make these same promises to our own beings? It is often easier to meet these outward expectations as we get openly chastised for being unreliable or betraying these same agreements. We so often see an outpouring of energy towards the external here at Erotic Living but what if we treated ourselves with the same importance and fierce accountability we reserve for those closest to us?
