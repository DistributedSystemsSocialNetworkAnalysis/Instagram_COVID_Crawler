You know what though? You aren\u2019t wearing them for you. You are wearing them out of respect for the health and safety of every single person around you. This isn\u2019t a political post. It\u2019s a human post because COVID doesn\u2019t care what side of politics you are on. Look...I get it, they are hot in general, especially in the summer, and they are a pain, uncomfortable, etc, but they are necessary if we ever want to have the world a normal and safe place again. I especially understand how uncomfortable they are because they actually cause me physical pain. When I had my accident last year, I had to have two plates and 12 screws put in above my mouth and I still suffer from extreme nerve damage. The plates among other things in my face cause pain 24\/7, but the level varies because of several different factors. Weather and extreme heat are big factors, and when I wear a mask, it intensifies any heat and humidity. It flat out sucks, but I do it because it\u2019s what I need to do for my friends, family, strangers...everyone. I know people who have lost the battle to COVID and I know too many people who have lost loved ones to this horrific pandemic. The heartbreak so many people have experienced this year breaks my heart, so if I have to deal with extra pain to help prevent further heartbreak, it\u2019s worth it to me. So if you think you are \u201Cimmune to Covid\u201D because you have antibodies 🙄 or they make you hot or it\u2019s messing up your makeup, please get over it and wear a damn mask. \n.\n.\n.\n.\n#dontsithome #mask #masks #covid #covid_19 #covid19 #covid2020 #2020 #coronavirus #coronavírus #socialdistance #socialdistancing #socialdistancing2020 #jerseycity #jerseycitynj #hobokennj #staysafe #flattenthecurve #wearamask #😷 #nyc #newyorkcity #sundaythoughts #weehawken #nj #newjersey #hobokengirl #corona #coronavid19","NumberOfLikes":179,"Hashtags":["#dontsithome","#mask","#masks","#covid","#covid_19","#covid19","#covid2020","#2020","#coronavirus","#coronavírus","#socialdistance","#socialdistancing","#socialdistancing2020","#jerseycity","#jerseycitynj","#hobokennj","#staysafe","#flattenthecurve","#wearamask","#😷","#nyc","#newyorkcity","#sundaythoughts","#weehawken","#nj","#newjersey","#hobokengirl","#corona","#coronavid19"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Don't Sit Home® | @dontsithome in Corgi Spirits at the Jersey City Distillery with @thrillist, @timeoutnewyork, @honeytrek, @nbcnewyork, @amandalady14, @thehobokengirl, @njdotcom, @neuroticmommy, @riversidemedicalgroup, @corgispirits, @littlehoboken, and @obcec.d.

Apparently we weren\u2019t the only ones who knew that because the queue to the rooftop was around the corner. \n\nWe were only in the country for a few days, so time was precious, but we took a chance. We stood in line, and luckily is moved quickly. We got a drink in hand and just made it in time to capture this shot! \n\nWhen given the option, always go for the sunset 🌅.
