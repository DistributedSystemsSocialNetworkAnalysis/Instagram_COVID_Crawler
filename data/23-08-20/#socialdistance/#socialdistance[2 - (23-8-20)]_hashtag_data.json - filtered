He developed the concept of Registrar General.\n* He developed the concept of treasury (Bait ul Maal). And he would spent on non Muslims as well from that.\n* He developed the system of taxing importing goods.\n* He decided in his time that coins should have specific weights which should be recorded and then used.\n* He in his leadership announced to never destroy a place of worship to those who are non Muslims.\n* He started the concept of Surveyor General basically. He surveyed and measured the lands and gave this idea to the Muslim world. \n\nMay Allah grant us his companionship in Jannat ul firdous!

There are those who care about people's health, and there are those who think it's a trick from the Democrats to get them to vote for them. To those who have been working hard to slow the spread of the coronavirus, I thank you very much.\n\nAs for those who are stubborn to think that this pandemic is fake, I tell you this: I'm stubborn as well. But I'm highly aware of when I'm stubborn, and I often tell myself that if I'm going to be stubborn, it better be something worth being stubborn about. I ask you this: are the deaths of over 170,000 Americans (this is just one part of the world) something worth ignoring? I hope not. There's a reason why people are warning you about the outbreak. Take it from someone who's had family members in Miami (a hotspot for the virus) get the virus. PLEASE take this pandemic seriously. I'm fortunate to not have lost anyone close to me from this virus, but many others haven't been so fortunate.\n\nThis is not a trick, but a wake up call to do what is right for everyone, not just for yourself. Wear a mask, even though you don't want to. If you don't wanna wear a mask, then don't leave your home. Social distance. It may take personal space to a whole new level, but it is to prevent contact with almost any disease. Clean often.

Mamma Elisabetta Canalis immortala la piccola Skyler, 5 anni a fine settembre, in posa per il primo giorno di scuola. Oltreoceano, a Los Angeles, le lezioni sono già iniziate con la modalità a distanza, on line, come le misure dovute all\u2019emergenza sanitaria impongono. In attesa di capire bene cosa succederà da noi auguriamo alla meravigliosa Skyler di vivere ogni attimo, tra i banchi, seppur virtuali, come una nuova scoperta. ❤️ @littlecrumb_\n#distancelearning #scuolaadistanza #tvstar #leveline #elisabettacanalis #socialdistance #school #kindergarten #madreefiglia #familyfirst #gentesettimanale #settimanalegente \n(📸 @littlecrumb_)","NumberOfLikes":719,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Gente Settimanale in Hearst Magazine | Italia with @littlecrumb_.
