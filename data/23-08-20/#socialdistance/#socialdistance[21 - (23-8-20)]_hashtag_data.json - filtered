This island is being a reception and ceremonial host to a wedding from a most popular couple. We are introduced on the day of the wedding and the days before. Multiple characters are introduced: the bride, bridesmaid, best man, the plus one (the bride\u2019s best friend wife), and the wedding planner. The day before the wedding there is tensions between the couple and the guest but it all unravels during the day of the wedding. \n\u2022\n\u2022\nIt was interesting, unique, and highly intriguing towards the end. However, I disliked the characters. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love a book that has multiple characters because it gives me a different perspective and their roles in the storyline. The only thing is I was just rooting one or two characters to get justice and the rest I disliked them. Additionally, I figured out the killer and the person who died before the ending which also gave me an uninterested ending. I would recommend hearing the book because it is quite exciting having the characters match a voice to. \nTherefore, I give this book:\n⭐️⭐️⭐️✨\/5 (3.75)\n \n#TheGuestList #booksbooksbooks #summerreadings #bestbookworld #libbyapp #bookblog #summerreading #books #bookstagram #booklover #bookstagrammer #instagood #instabooks #instabookstagram #bookgram #bookgrammer #socialdistance #ilovebooks #book #reading #barnesandnoble","NumberOfLikes":30,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by 𝚂 𝙰 𝚁 𝙰 𝙷 𝙸 on July 29, 2020.

Wear your mask. This is the way.\n😷\nYesterday afternoon, I went on an adventure around the city. Some may call it a walk, but at this point in the pandemic, any outing is better suited to be called an adventure; it helps make the seclusion feel more hopeful.\n.\nOne thing that makes any activity  more fun is an adventure buddy. This could be anyone (or anything in my case), but being able to have a shared experience in times like this can help significantly with the being apart moments. For someone like me, who lives alone, this isolation has been extra tough. I watch as people talk about the time at home bringing them closer to friends & family and while that is still true, it\u2019s very different when you don\u2019t see anyone but the stuffed animals on your bed & the Dobby statue by the door.\n.\nIn the last few weeks, people have started asking me to come out and do things with them and for someone who has not only been alone for months, but sees everything you have (or haven\u2019t) been doing on social media, I have had to say no multiple times. We are still in a pandemic even if other people may be acting like it\u2019s over, so I\u2019ve set my own boundaries that make me comfortable and I won\u2019t veer from them. I call this my personal Phase One. I have decided on two \u201Cadventure buddies\u201D and for the time being those are the only people I am allowing myself to see. Limiting my contact with others is allowing me to feel comfortable phasing back to regular life and allows me to prevent myself from unknowingly passing anything to anyone or catching something from someone who is being less cautious.\n.\nWe need to normalize this behavior. Normalize being allowed to say no to seeing people during a pandemic and not be guilted for doing so. Everyone has their own comfort levels and once you decide on yours, you should stick to what your gut says.\n.\nFor now, I don\u2019t plan to move to my personal Phase Two until October.

I learned about this from these accounts, which you can follow for more info @beelzeboobz @accordingtoweeze\n\n🖤 If you posted already without knowing the full story, I challenge you to educate yourself.

Similarly, citizen activation becomes an essential tool for the consolidation of a new culture of co-responsibility. \u201CThe Responsible Return\u201D is a tactical urban planning and placemaking strategy that seeks to influence the reactivation of the city through resilient, responsible and adaptable public spaces to gradual post-pandemic recovery processes. Check out the profile of @nmdlab to find out more about their work.\u2060\n\u2060\nThe objective of this urban tactic was the creation of healthy occupation nodes through physical distance grids and stencils of culture\/citizen care, taking advantage of the spaciousness and open space that the courts and the park provide. With these new configurations, flexible spaces are generated that represent a responsible recreation alternative within the new normality. Little by little we will take up public spaces and we will have to do it alongside a new urban-citizen culture. \u2060\n.\u2060\n.\u2060\n.\u2060\n#jorgeurias #placemaking #placemakingmx #nuevanormalidad #newnormal2020 #sanadistancia #socialdistance #postcoviddesign #espaciopublico #publicspace  #basketballcourt #diseñosocial #socialdesign #urbanintervention #intervencionurbana #mexicocreativo #dronegram #designboom #superarchitects #arquine #revistaplot #designmilk #archdaily #divisare #dezeen #architizer #ciudadjuarez #juarez\u2060","NumberOfLikes":40,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":16,"Timestamp":1596053540,"LocalDate":"Wed Jul 29 22:12:20 CEST 2020","Location":"Ciudad Juárez"},{"CaptionText":"Real estate is essential business, so safe office access is so appreciated! 🙏 \n\nThank you to @jbgsmith and @theshopsatfairfaxsquare for putting socially distant protocols and practices in place!!

Saat hidup berlalu begitu saja dan disibukkan dengan pekerjaan, semangat MAGIS mengajakku untuk tetap menemukan Allah.\u2063\n\u2063\nSalah satu kebiasaan dalam formasi MAGIS adalah examen (pemeriksaan batin) dan menulis jurnal harian. Dalam examen, aku diajak untuk kembali memutar hariku. Karena ingatanku terbatas,  bagiku menulis jurnal harian menjadi \u201Cpaket lengkap\u201D dari examen.\u2063\n\u2063\nDengan menulis jurnal harian, aku pun dapat menyelam lebih dalam pada peristiwa yang terjadi, dan pada perasaanku sendiri. \u201CBagaimana perasaanku hari ini? Apa yang membuatku merasa demikian? Mengapa aku melakukan tindakan A dan bukan B? Apa dampak dari tindakanku tersebut? Baik atau burukkah? Apa yang bisa kubuat dengan lebih baik di kemudian hari? Apa yang dikehendaki Tuhan lewat peristiwa yang kualami hari ini?\u201D Ada rasa lega dan nyaman saat merefleksikan hidup harian, mencurahkan perasaan pada Tuhan lewat tulisan. Rasanya seperti curhat dengan seorang sahabat. Plong!\u2063\n\u2063\nDalam jangka panjang, menulis jurnal harian juga membantuku untuk menyadari ke arah mana Tuhan sedang mengarahkan hidupku dan melihat pola-pola yang ada. Aku semakin mengenal diriku, menyadari apa yang menjadi kelekatanku, apa yang membuatku jauh dan dekat pada-Nya. Dia mendidikku untuk setia dan berkembang lewat pengalaman pahit, tapi juga menghiburku lewat orang-orang di sekitarku. Semua peristiwa itu pada akhirnya baik, hanya perlu mengambil jarak dan melihat dengan sudut pandang yang tepat.\u2063\n\u2063\nSetia dalam proses (menulis) itu tidaklah mudah. Banyak godaan yang ada, tapi mari terus mengolah diri dan menjadi versi terbaik dari diri kita sebagai citra-Nya. \u2063\nAd Maiorem Dei Gloriam!\u2063\n\u2063\n🖊️ : @luisacatherine\u2063\n\u2063\n#jesuitinsight #katolikvidgram #katolikmedia #sahabatkatolik #berandakatolik #omkindonesia #omk #instakatolik #katolikmuda #prompangsj #hitsomk #magisindonesia #jesuitinsight #togetherAMDG #jesuit #katolik #serikatyesus #socialdistance #findingGodinallthing #AMDG #hopeinallthings #ignatianleadership #iteinflamateomnia #manwoman4others #solidaritas","NumberOfLikes":69,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Jesuit Insight on July 29, 2020 tagging @magisbrasil, @letsinspire.co, @katolikvidgram, @berandakatolik, @magis.indonesia, @sahabatkatolik, @komsoskotabaru, @katolik.muda, @magiszimbabwe, @prompang.sj, @magis_kr, @magis.macau, @magisamericas, @magismalaysia, @jesuitsasiapacific, @magisyouthcenter, @magiseurope, @jesuitindonesia, @alumnijesuit_id, and @magis.pilipinas.

Poster paint and graphite on found cardboard, ca. 1939-42. 9.75\u201D x 8\u201D. [AVAILABLE]\nTraylor (ca. 1854-1949), born a slave, created his own extraordinary history of drawing in more than 1,200 images that brought to life a world of chicken stealing, hunting, plowing, preaching, drinking, arguing and testifying, as well as many vivid representations of the animal world. His technique developed rapidly; from the use of simple geometric shapes to complex abstract constructions peopled with multiple tiny figures in motion.\nDuring the 1940s, visitors of Montgomery AL would have been treated to a startling sight: in a chair, next to a Coca Cola cooler sat a massive, dignified old man with a drawing board across his lap; he never stopped drawing. The mere three years when Traylor produced his entire opus toward the end of his life, were a key window in the history of American art.\nMost of Traylor\u2019s work was preserved by Charles Shannon (his white patron and friend). After Traylor\u2019s death, Shannon began a prolonged effort to bring his work to the public. Today his works are regarded as one the major triumphs of Self-Taught art. He is featured in numerous publications and his work is in various private and museum collections, including The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Whitney Museum American Art, the Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts, and the High Museum of Art.\n*\n*\n*\n#art #modernart #SelfTaughtArt #OutsiderArt #AfricanAmericanArt #worksonpaper #basquet #posterpaint #cobaltblue #blue #deepbblue #drawing #minimalism #abstractedfiguration #newgalleryspace #socialdistance #NYC #RiccoMaresca #FrankMarescaArt","NumberOfLikes":329,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by FRANK MARESCA in Ricco\/Maresca Gallery.","NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1596036505,"LocalDate":"Wed Jul 29 17:28:25 CEST 2020","Location":"Ricco\/Maresca Gallery"},{"CaptionText":"Dreaming is good.
