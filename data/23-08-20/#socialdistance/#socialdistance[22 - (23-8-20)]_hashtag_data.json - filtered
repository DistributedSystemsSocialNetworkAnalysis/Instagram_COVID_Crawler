I could end the caption with that and based on his production so far, you\u2019d have to believe me. \nHe finished as QB3 in fantasy last year and there\u2019s reason to think he can do that and more this year. Wilson was 3rd in passing TDs (31), 6th in passing yards (4111) and he was also top 10 in deep ball completion (39.8 %). Wilson was also best at keeping the ball away from the opponents has he was 1st in interceptable passes per game (0.6%).\nWilson is the only QB to finish within the Top 10 in fantasy each of the past three seasons. He\u2019s also been the most durable QB since he\u2019s entered the league. He hasn\u2019t missed a single start ever. He\u2019s second among active QBs and 8th all time in consecutive starts. In fact, he\u2019s only missed two practices his entire nine season career (attended funerals in each absence). \nDespite having undoubtedly one of the worst offensive lines (28th according to PFF), Wilson has managed to stay upright and become one of the greatest escape artists the league\u2019s ever seen. \n\nWilson\u2019s hungry. HE. HAS. NOT. EVER. RECEIVED. AN. MVP. VOTE. \u201CCome on! No votes at all? What more do I have to do around here, huh? I\u2019m just saying, can we get a few votes here or there? Why not?\u201D- Russell Wilson\nHe\u2019s been tremendously consistent, but perhaps put up his best season in 2017. I think he gets back to that this season. Brian Schottenheimer has curtailed Wilson\u2019s passing numbers over the past couple of seasons, but collectively they want this for Russ and the team. They\u2019ll let him air it out more. His defense will also allow him to see the field more with their recent upgrades. \nI believe Russell Wilson will be the frontrunner for MVP at the halfway mark of the season and eclipse 400 fantasy points this year.

I could have picked a glamorous picture to make black and white to support my sisters who have tagged me to post, but the truth is, this is my current reality and I wanted to take the time to bring some light and awareness to what is going on in our country 🇺🇸. OUR planet 🌎, and yes that includes you. ALL of us.\n.\nI have been blessed with the opportunity to contribute in the slightest bit to this pandemic, and I have the privilege to work alongside some amazing frontline healthcare workers and see first hand what is truly going on.\n.\nMany of us get to sit sheltered in the comfort of our homes and \u201Ctelework\u201D. Many have lost their jobs and ability to work. Many are overwhelmed with the amount of work they have to do. Some have lost someone they love, many have lost their lives and at least one person knows if someone who has. Somewhere in between, we all have to come up with a way to \u201Cpull our own\u201D and help each other get through this very tough and stressful time.\n.\nI want to specifically ask that each and every one of you do your part, and if you\u2019re not trained and equipped to be in the frontlines, please please please do your best to social distance, always wear a mask when you\u2019re out, and avoid gatherings. Masks are uncomfortable, but some MUST wear 3 layers of masks 😷(N-95s which are specifically tailored for front line health care works + a surgical mask + a face shield) JUST to stay safe while caring for very sick patients. I\u2019m getting to experience this.\n.\nAnd I felt compelled to share this with you. That\u2019s how I choose to empower you today, in observance of all my fellow doctors, therapists, nurses, custodial staff, support staff, and everyone I see out here on the floor giving it their best, every single day. I feel privileged and proud to be part of this.

We thought we\u2019d have a look and, make a decision on how safe we would be when we got there. They were not busy and we received a warm welcome from Margaret (one of the owners). She and her staff could not have been nicer. They set up a table for two, in the shade, 20+ feet away from the other patrons. We ordered the beer, drank it, took it away, and, paid all from our table.\n The neat thing about this Pilsner is that, one dollar from every can goes to the #highparkzoo a Toronto institution. It\u2019s interesting to note how much the #craftbeer industry, supports causes in their own communities and, larger things, (sometimes worldwide).

More than 150 doctors recommended closing down this entire country to get this virus under control so we can possibly go back to our lives sooner rather than later. But I'm sure that won't fly with people yelping about their rights, freedoms and conspiracy theories. But opening and closing is not getting it done.\n\nThere's no national strategy because we have incompetent science-denying Republican goofballs running the show in the Trump administration, and at state and local levels, Trump and the Republicans are trying to send kids back to school to become infected and pass that deadly virus on to others.\n\nTrump and crew must go!
