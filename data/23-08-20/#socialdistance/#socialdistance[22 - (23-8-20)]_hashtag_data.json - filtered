I could end the caption with that and based on his production so far, you\u2019d have to believe me. \nHe finished as QB3 in fantasy last year and there\u2019s reason to think he can do that and more this year. Wilson was 3rd in passing TDs (31), 6th in passing yards (4111) and he was also top 10 in deep ball completion (39.8 %). Wilson was also best at keeping the ball away from the opponents has he was 1st in interceptable passes per game (0.6%).\nWilson is the only QB to finish within the Top 10 in fantasy each of the past three seasons. He\u2019s also been the most durable QB since he\u2019s entered the league. He hasn\u2019t missed a single start ever. He\u2019s second among active QBs and 8th all time in consecutive starts. In fact, he\u2019s only missed two practices his entire nine season career (attended funerals in each absence). \nDespite having undoubtedly one of the worst offensive lines (28th according to PFF), Wilson has managed to stay upright and become one of the greatest escape artists the league\u2019s ever seen. \n\nWilson\u2019s hungry. HE. HAS. NOT. EVER. RECEIVED. AN. MVP. VOTE. \u201CCome on! No votes at all? What more do I have to do around here, huh?¬†I\u2019m just saying, can we get a few votes here or there? Why not?\u201D- Russell Wilson\nHe\u2019s been tremendously consistent, but perhaps put up his best season in 2017. I think he gets back to that this season. Brian Schottenheimer has curtailed Wilson\u2019s passing numbers over the past couple of seasons, but collectively they want this for Russ and the team. They\u2019ll let him air it out more. His defense will also allow him to see the field more with their recent upgrades. \nI believe Russell Wilson will be the frontrunner for MVP at the halfway mark of the season and eclipse 400 fantasy points this year.

I am delighted to introduce something new which I have been working on for the past 2 weeks since I received a call from @aneeqahsheikart who is employed by Avenu Tech(Pty) Ltd. Unfortunately they are not on Instagram so I am unable to tag them.\nAneeqa requested a team building activity to keep their staff engaged, excited & enthusiastic during these unforseen strange Pandemic times.\nCovid 19 has sprung upon us so rapidly that we all needed to think outside of the box.\n\"Shamila's kitchen has created a new\n\" Cook with me\" kit with step by step easy to follow instructions, one of many to follow.\nThe request was for a Ba Bun kit & naturally I obliged as honouring all types of requests is my forte.\nWith the help of @waseemaallie94 my keen \"photographer\" I could put this all together.\nA huge thankyou to @tone_media for my new look with the printing of my last minute request for stickers as it added to my presentation which was well received & complimented on upon delivery which I undertook personally today.\nShukran Yumnah for your efficient service.\nI commend Avenu tech for being such a thoughtful company by indulging their team by staying connected with innovative & creative activities.\nFor everyone else out there we can design any type of \"Cook with me\" kit tailored to your needs.\nBesides this being a good & different idea for team building its a great way to interact with family & friends especially during these trying times when social distancing is practiced.\nGreat idea for Zoom workshops.\nContact us with your requests & we will make it happen!\n \"making meals & memories\"\n#teambuildingactivity\n#socialdistance\n#mealkitsupply\n#homemade","NumberOfComments":16,"Timestamp":1595966419,"LocalDate":"Tue Jul 28 22:00:19 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"There\u2019s a fuckin pandemic going on and cases are rising all over this damn country but the Governor of Ohio thinks it\u2019s okay to send your child to back daycare at full capacity???

I am a real #REALFRONTLINEDOCTOR fighting this thing with my team of nurses, RTs, and techs.  We face Covid and death daily.  When these covid positive patients are tanking, I am the one that is going to put the tube down their lungs so they can breath.  We see the dangers of this virus every damn day, doing our very best to not catch it ourselves and bring it home to our familes.  We wear 2 layers of masks, goggles,, face shields for 10-12 hours a day. If there was a medication that that was an end all fix all, we wouldn't be where we are now.  We deal with real evidence-based science.\n\nThere's viral bullshit video that you have all seen and nothing makes me more mad than a \"fellow doctor\" spreading misinformation that is deadly.  I dont understand her motive, either she is staged or a fraud physician, or both.  There is no scientific evidence supporting the claims of a magical cure. \n\nBottomline, that video is dangerous and whats even scarier is that it's being shared by some prominent community leaders and hip hop artists who are all jumping on the bandwagon.  This deadly disease has been disproportionately affecting black and Latinx communities and now this dangerous misinformation is being spread by a black \"physician\" on black social media.

OUR planet üåé, and yes that includes you. ALL of us.\n.\nI have been blessed with the opportunity to contribute in the slightest bit to this pandemic, and I have the privilege to work alongside some amazing frontline healthcare workers and see first hand what is truly going on.\n.\nMany of us get to sit sheltered in the comfort of our homes and \u201Ctelework\u201D. Many have lost their jobs and ability to work. Many are overwhelmed with the amount of work they have to do. Some have lost someone they love, many have lost their lives and at least one person knows if someone who has. Somewhere in between, we all have to come up with a way to \u201Cpull our own\u201D and help each other get through this very tough and stressful time.\n.\nI want to specifically ask that each and every one of you do your part, and if you\u2019re not trained and equipped to be in the frontlines, please please please do your best to social distance, always wear a mask when you\u2019re out, and avoid gatherings.

Basically, the machine is activated when anyone gets within 6ft and S.A.M will set off an alarm informing people they are not social distancing as they should be. We don't know how exactly he built it but it seems like there's some sort of sensor which allows the machine to sense where people are and then begins to beep. However, this young man built it and we're amazed! His father is trying to get him into a private school and are currently raising money through go fund me.

We thought we\u2019d have a look and, make a decision on how safe we would be when we got there. They were not busy and we received a warm welcome from Margaret (one of the owners). She and her staff could not have been nicer. They set up a table for two, in the shade, 20+ feet away from the other patrons. We ordered the beer, drank it, took it away, and, paid all from our table.\n The neat thing about this Pilsner is that, one dollar from every can goes to the #highparkzoo a Toronto institution. It\u2019s interesting to note how much the #craftbeer industry, supports causes in their own communities and, larger things, (sometimes worldwide).

Maybe that's saying to stop the madness and end all sports until this virus is under control. The #coronavirus is cutting a destructive swath across this country, and turning the US into a humongous petri dish. More than 150 doctors recommended closing down this entire country to get this virus under control so we can possibly go back to our lives sooner rather than later. But I'm sure that won't fly with people yelping about their rights, freedoms and conspiracy theories. But opening and closing is not getting it done.\n\nThere's no national strategy because we have incompetent science-denying Republican goofballs running the show in the Trump administration, and at state and local levels, Trump and the Republicans are trying to send kids back to school to become infected and pass that deadly virus on to others.\n\nTrump and crew must go! If not, we're going to be looking like an episode out of the Walking Dead. Is having fun worth risking your health, your family's, friend's and everyone you come in contact with? Apparently to some people it is. I'm sick and tired of being locked down, wearing a mask and social distancing, but I know it needs to be done to protect myself and those I love and care about. I have common sense. It's all fun and games until your ass ends up deathly ill and on a ventilator fighting for your life.\n\n#LockThisCountryDown #Covid19 #WeartheMask #SocialDistance","NumberOfLikes":8,"Hashtags":["#coronavirus","#LockThisCountryDown","#Covid19","#WeartheMask","#SocialDistance"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Sydney Chandler on July 27, 2020.
