With the help of Lindsay I found what I would call is the most beautiful granite countertop I had ever seen. From start to finish they were in touch with me and before I knew it they came and did the template. They called me the day they were going to cut my piece of granite so I could have a look at what I was actually getting to approve it and of course it was a stunning piece and I could not believe it would be mine. The day of install could not have gone smoother. The guys that came to do it were amazing and did a perfect job!

I\u2019m a MASK WEARER! To my friends & family, to my coworkers & acquaintances, I LOVE YOU and I MISS YOU! And when I see you I will wear a mask because I love you. Please also wear one when you see me. I can not wait to give you a hug, but for now I care too much about the health & safety of my family and myself to risk any exposure. I care too much about you. This goes against what feels natural, and even talking about it feels uncomfortable. So now you know my stance. Please keep a distance and wear a mask so that sooner than later we can all come together like we used to. Please remind others to be courteous and be respectful of those who are being extra careful. When you see friends, keep in mind that they might be trying to be more cautious than you are, and remember to ask them if they are comfortable with the situation. This is new territory for everyone, so let's listen to each other, respect each other, and love each other.\n____\n\n#wearamask #covid19 #socialdistance #bethechangeyouwanttosee #newterritory #forthegoodofothers #doyourpart #mask #facemask #coronavirus #stayhome #staysafe #quarantine #socialdistancing #stayathome #covidportrait #maskwearer #imamaskwearer #humanity #bestme #makeadifference #tellyourtruth #beyourself #smilingeyes #iseeyou #newnormal #savelives #fortheworld #mystance #becauseiloveyou","NumberOfLikes":1,"Hashtags":["#wearamask","#covid19","#socialdistance","#bethechangeyouwanttosee","#newterritory","#forthegoodofothers","#doyourpart","#mask","#facemask","#coronavirus","#stayhome","#staysafe","#quarantine","#socialdistancing","#stayathome","#covidportrait","#maskwearer","#imamaskwearer","#humanity","#bestme","#makeadifference","#tellyourtruth","#beyourself","#smilingeyes","#iseeyou","#newnormal","#savelives","#fortheworld","#mystance","#becauseiloveyou"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Mask Wearer 😷 on July 27, 2020.

Anyway...\n\nIf you know me at all, you are well aware that the last few months of 2019 and most of 2020 have been pretty hard for me. In a span of less than four months, I lost the two most important women in my life. Some days are good, and some aren\u2019t. Sometimes I\u2019m okay, sometimes I\u2019m not - at all. \n\nAs we continue to #quarantine and #socialdistance, I think it\u2019s important to talk about mental health and when we aren\u2019t okay. Social media makes a lot of people feel like they need to show off their best moments and retreat from the bad ones. In actuality, it\u2019s the struggles we learn from most because we have to find our way out of the valleys to once again be on solid ground. \n\nI\u2019ve had anxiety all of my life and it has manifested itself into bouts of depression from time to time. I also have ADD which was only diagnosed a few years ago (I\u2019ve always had it but never spoke up). You know what? It\u2019s okay. All of these components make up who I am. I am still an eternal optimist, sometimes irrationally positive, and a hopeless romantic - and I\u2019m not always okay. \n\nAs hard as 2020 has been, I\u2019ve also had some incredible moments that I wouldn\u2019t trade for the world. I\u2019ve been blessed to spend time with people that I pray are in my life forever and that make me happier than I have ever been (I hope you know who you are and how much you mean to me. 💙💙💙). \n\nThis may feel a little disjointed, but I just wanted anyone reading this to know that it\u2019s perfectly okay to not be okay. You aren\u2019t and will never be alone. No matter where you are reading this, my DMs are always open if you need someone that understands. \n\nNever forget that a bit of kindness can go a long way and change a person\u2019s day or the trajectory of someone\u2019s life.
