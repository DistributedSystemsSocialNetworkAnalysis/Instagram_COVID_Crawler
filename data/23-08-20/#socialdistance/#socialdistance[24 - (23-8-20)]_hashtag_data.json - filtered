This is called source control. This recommendation is based on what we know about the role respiratory droplets play in the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19, paired with emerging evidence from clinical and laboratory studies that shows cloth face coverings reduce the spray of droplets when worn over the nose and mouth. COVID-19 spreads mainly among people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet), so the use of cloth face coverings is particularly important in settings where people are close to each other or where social distancing is difficult to maintain.\n-\n-\n- Follow us: @slhmedicalsupply\n-\n-\n- #covid19, #staysafe, #healthcare, #safetheworld, #pandemic, #mask, #socialdistance, #coronavirus, #prevention, #avoidcontact, #sanitizer, #protectiveequipment, #disinfection, #washyourhands","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#covid19,","#staysafe,","#healthcare,","#safetheworld,","#pandemic,","#mask,","#socialdistance,","#coronavirus,","#prevention,","#avoidcontact,","#sanitizer,","#protectiveequipment,","#disinfection,","#washyourhands"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by SLH Medical Supply on July 26, 2020.

We went to Saturday\u2019s market and I have to say I have never seen someone so excited to be out seeing new and unfamiliar faces. She had the best time ever and it was something so mundane! \n\nI keep wondering to myself what life must feel like from her eyes. Does she truly miss social connection? Is she wondering about what all the fuss is about with social distancing and masks?\n\nAlthough we have entered into phase three, we have been very slow to introduce this new way of life to our kids. \n\nI am teaching her the importance of wearing a mask, keeping her distance and thorough hand washing, but also hoping she never feels anxiety or fear in these uncertain times. \n\nI wonder what we can take from this experience and how we can become more resilient and stronger than before.\n\nAnd my hope is that we all come out of this year with fresh eyes. \n\nTo slow down, \nenjoy human connection, \nbe kind to one another,\nto fully appreciate our health \nand to take care of ourselves. \n\nhugs,\nShan","NumberOfLikes":37,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Shana on July 26, 2020.

We don't need, or want to be hailed as #heroes. All front line #health workers just want to be #safe, and keep our families safe. That includes having enough personal protective equipment to protect ourselves, our staff, and our #community. As some of you know, I also work in the Emergency Department and we have been seeing increased respiratory cases and also cases from interstate since our borders open. Unfortunately, this means we've had to step up our wearing of masks and other PPE. This also means that if you're unwell or have travelled from anywhere that's not #Queensland, let us know in advance. We've caught people telling untruths about where they've been and their symptoms. This is NOT right. This is #SELFISH. We will still provide you with adequate care, but in order to do so, we must also feel safe. We have families we go home to. I have a 1 year old who waits for me at #home. Please do the right thing.\nWhile we understand you want to #holiday in our #beautiful state, we also expect you to be #responsible and still social distance or wear a #mask if you can't.

And I will definitely be investing in a bottle of this vermouth! \n.\nI got the opportunity to get to know Sandra a few months a go with her fantastic, brilliant and entertaining #GinADayMay posts. She is such a kind hearted lady, who takes no bull💩 !!! I feel grateful to have virtually met her! She is great to talk to and my gosh she knows her gin and her martini's and negroni's. \nJulian is a treasure to know, I honestly am in absolute awe at how much knowledge this man has - I can only describe him as a walking Encyclopedia for Spirits. Is there anything he doesn't know!! He is a true pleasure to talk to and is also a fellow F1 fan!! 🤗🏎🏁\n.\nI honestly cannot tell you guys how grateful I am for all their advice they have given me.\nIt is on my bucket list to have an actual sociable drink with them both one day!","NumberOfLikes":81,"Hashtags":["#JuniperJuly","#SocialDistance","#GinADayMay"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Dee @ The Gin Library 🍸 on July 25, 2020 tagging @therealjuniperchick, @julianvallis, and @vermouthdolin.
