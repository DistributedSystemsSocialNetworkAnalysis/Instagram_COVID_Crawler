Or made smoke rings with a cigarette or even an incense stick? \n\nThe name of the \u2018doughnut\u2019 shape I\u2019m describing is called a torus and the reason this profound toroidal form is created (actually around all living things) is because it is self sustaining, self organizing and it optimises survival energy.\n\nNew thinking scientists and many ancient medicine traditions believe this \u2018torus\u2019 exists around us too and when the heart field is coherent it extends all the way around your body past your widest reach ... a distance of about 2 meters (though it can be much more for people who are enlightened and much less for people in fear)\n\n2 METERS ISN\u2019T THAT FASCINATING!\n\nI have been studying energy medicine for over 10 years now and I\u2019m often explaining to people that it isn\u2019t some woo woo alternative practice.\n\nIf you\u2019ve felt your heart and your energy soar while listening to music, dancing, or singing. If you\u2019ve had a dream that carried an important message perhaps from a loved one who has passed. If you\u2019ve shed tears of pain or joy and felt cleansed as a result. If you\u2019ve ever communicated deeply with someone to the point of having a new realisation ... you have experienced energy medicine. \n \nEnergy medicine is part of who we are, and how we relate to each other and the world around us and it regulates that torus shaped field of energy through the coherence of our hearts ♥️ ... that field of energy that perhaps people in mainstream authority are not educating us about because having knowledge of it and connecting with it (through our emotions and through feeling CONNECTED) creates huge potential for health and healing.\n\nPlease repost ... and encourage others to Google \u2018torus\u2019 \u2018toroidal energy field\u2019 . It may create questions around the need for social distancing vs social connection. 💗\n\n#torus #health #vibration #inspiration #floweroflife #science \u2063#wellness #mentalhealth #consciousness #awakening #holistichealing #selfhealingjourney #healingjourney #love #healing #energyhealing #socialdistance #coronavirus","NumberOfLikes":13,"Hashtags":["#torus","#health","#vibration","#inspiration","#floweroflife","#science","#wellness","#mentalhealth","#consciousness","#awakening","#holistichealing","#selfhealingjourney","#healingjourney","#love","#healing","#energyhealing","#socialdistance","#coronavirus"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Jo Wyse on July 24, 2020.

This is a time of fight or flight and everyone's version of saving their life looks different. I made this signage because I know that people are still continuing to have gatherings and events. Babies are being born, birthdays are happening, and boredom is certainly in the air. Germs however- are also in the air. This disease can have devestating and lasting symptoms like losing your sense of smell and at worse- losing your life. I hope to make this signage available on my website as a free download this weekend. In the meantime, please DM me and I'll personally email you these posters and more originals that I have created\n\n So, most people in my life do not know I live with a disability. A couple of years ago I suffered an intense fatigue from overworking myself that permanently harmed my immune system and body. I've experienced hair loss, hives, difficulty breathing, and relearning my abilities. I eat fruits and vegetables and eat my vitamins- I stretch and stay active and busy. Unfortunately no amount of vegan food or meditation will afford me the luxury of being able to repair the loss my body underwent. Most days I am buried under a heating pad and coated in tiger balm. This pandemic has been quite the challenge for everyone. Being immunocompromised it has been really damaging to my mental health to feel I can't leave my house because many people do not have face coverings (whether that is a mask or shield or even just maintaining distance). Since March, I've been able to leave my house less than 5 times and each time has been risky and stomach flipping. Please consider your community and loved ones. You can tape these around your event or even send them to that WhatsApp group chat.\n\n#covid #covidevent #smizing #psa #signage #do #dont #health #coronavirus #germs #mask #masks #covid19 #socialdistance #staysafe #freedownload #smile #cough #safety #guidelines #stopthespread #immunocompromised #disabled #disability #immunesystem #antm #tyra","NumberOfLikes":67,"Hashtags":["#covid","#covidevent","#smizing","#psa","#signage","#do","#dont","#health","#coronavirus","#germs","#mask","#masks","#covid19","#socialdistance","#staysafe","#freedownload","#smile","#cough","#safety","#guidelines","#stopthespread","#immunocompromised","#disabled","#disability","#immunesystem","#antm","#tyra"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":6,"Timestamp":1595649351,"LocalDate":"Sat Jul 25 05:55:51 CEST 2020","Location":"Smize and Shine Beauty"},{"CaptionText":"Today marks stop four of our #2020roadtrip.

We will not be providing an explanation for all of the minor changes that happen in the future, but we will today to provide an example of how the reported numbers can have small discrepancies from day to day and yet are still accurate at the time of posting. On July 23, 2020, we reported 524 total cases. On July 24, we reported 27 new cases and 550 new cases. The reason that there are 550 total cases on July 24, 2020, rather than 551 is that during the case investigation yesterday it was found that one of the cases attributed to Brewster in Okanogan County is actually a resident of a neighboring county. This information was updated in the Washington State database accordingly, and therefore, that case is no longer being reported as an Okanogan County case. Additionally, one case that was not yet assigned a city yesterday was determined to be from Omak.","NumberOfLikes":3,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Okanogan County Public Health on July 24, 2020.

I have been very blessed to have a strong immune system that I strongly believe helped me fight the virus and not get as sick as other people has gotten.  At the time of my test and results , I was completely asymptotic. It\u2019s a little scary to think that I was positive and I did not even feel anything at the beginning. I started feeling my symptoms at Day 3- since being positive: My only symptoms were headaches, fatigue, low -grade fever, and nausea (no vomiting x1 day only). I AM NOW 100% WELL & BACK TO NORMAL. What I am super proud to say is that nobody around me got sick from me. Mom, dad, and especially, Abby THEY ARE ALL WELL. None of my co-workers or patients got sick from me. Here is the takeaway from this: 1️\u20E3 You can have COVID19 even if you don\u2019t have symptoms. 2️\u20E3 Wearing a MASK, hand-washing, sanitizing, & social distancing WORKS! 3️\u20E3 Vitamin C (2000mg) + Zinc daily shortens the illness course and severity.  4️\u20E3 Living a healthy lifestyle: eating well and  exercising improves your fighting chance against COVID19 \u203C️ I was never really scared of getting COVID myself, rather I was scared that other people who are immunocompromised, ill, the very young, the very old, and people with respiratory issues would get it. Again, I just don\u2019t wear  a mask , wash my hands, sanitize, and social distance for myself. I DO IT FOR OTHERS! I want to protect people around me. I want everybody to have a fighting chance. We just have to ALL WORK TOGETHER , and eventually WE WILL ALL GET THROUGH THIS!  We are in this together, as families, communities,  and global citizens. This pandemic is  so much more than a local or national issue. It is a GLOBAL PROBLEM, and WE ALL HAVE THE POWER AND RESPONSIBILITY TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION\u203C️ #wearamask #socialdistance #sanitize #washyourhands #fightcovid19  There is no \u201CONE\u201D hero in this , it takes ALL OF US TO BE OUR OWN HEROES\u203C️ Thanks everyone for doing your part 🙏🏻💝","NumberOfLikes":66,"Hashtags":["#wearamask","#socialdistance","#sanitize","#washyourhands","#fightcovid19"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":23,"Timestamp":1595620409,"LocalDate":"Fri Jul 24 21:53:29 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"What a wonderful surprise it was for Elsa and Anna to see Olaf and Sven had already made themselves right at home!\n\nWe\u2019re so excited for another very busy weekend ahead at Lockdown Magic!

Und der müssen wir uns stellen. So wie MIKE LITT, Familienvater, Radiomoderator, Autor und DJ.\n\nVor 45 Jahren erschien das fünfte Studioalbum der Düsseldorfer Gruppe Kraftwerk mit dem Titel Radio-Aktivität. Radio-Aktivität, dieses Wort muss für Sie eine ganz besondere Bedeutung haben? Das ist eine sehr interessante Frage! Ich hatte noch nie darüber nachgedacht bis jetzt. Damals als Kind habe ich das Titelstück durchaus wahrgenommen. Es war mir ein bisschen unheimlich ... der Sound ist ja wirklich sehr speziell und war futuristisch zu der Zeit. Dass das irgendwas mit meinem Leben zu tun haben könnte, war mir damals nicht klar. Ich dachte eher, das ist so eine Musik, die spielt auf einem fremden Planeten oder in einer Welt, die sich gerade in der Krise befindet. Jetzt plötzlich denke ich: könnte vielleicht gerade der passende Soundtrack fürs Hier und Jetzt sein. Und ich bin tatsächlich zur Zeit sehr radioaktiv, also ich mache viel Radio und Podcast - meine Sendungen für WDR2 und den \u201EClub der Republik\u201C bei Deutschlandfunk Nova. Außerdem die Podcastserie \u201EAlle Rhein!\u201C für die Stadt Düsseldorf.\n\nWann findet Ihr nächster bezahlter Auftritt statt und wo wird er stattfinden? Ich verstehe meine Radioabende ja auch als Auftritte, bei denen ich mich bemühe, einen Verbindung zu den Menschen aufzubauen, auch wenn ich sie nicht sehe. Aber es gibt tatsächlich wieder eine Moderation vor Publikum und unter freiem Himmel am 15. August im Amphitheater in Dorsten. Da freue ich mich sehr drauf! Ich moderiere eine Lesung mit dem Schriftsteller Andreas Heidtmann. Er liest aus seinem Roman \u201EWie wir uns lange nicht küssten, als ABBA berühmt wurde\u201C. Es geht um das Lebensgefühl damals, weniger um ABBA. Ein tolles Buch voller Musik und Verweise auf die Popkultur damals im Jahr 1974, also noch ein Jahr bevor \u201ERadio-Aktivität\u201C erschien. Ansonsten: kurz bevor es mit Corona richtig los ging, standen ein paar DJ-Gigs u.a. in Luxemburg im Kalender, die dann auf unbestimmte Zeit verschoben wurden. Ich hatte gehofft, dass wir das nun allmählich nachholen können, ... [Fortsetzung in den Kommentaren]","NumberOfLikes":50,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Hartmut S.

From his hospital bed in the ICU as he struggled to breathe, my dad urged me to take all precautions to keep from getting this virus. It wasn\u2019t the first time he made this plea for us to not get this virus, but it was the last time.\n.\nEven though he and my mom wore the masks, sanitized, stayed home, shopped the senior hours, they still got this virus. On July 3, my mom died from it, and on July 21, my dad died from it. Why? Because it takes EVERYONE doing all the things, and someone was negligent in their actions and exposed them to it.\n.\nAs his last request.....\n.\n*Please take all the precautions possible to stop this virus from spreading and infecting those who are at highest risk.\n*Please stop getting your medical advice from politicians with no medical expertise backing them up.\n*Educate yourself from knowledgable, reliable, credible, fact based, scientific researched sources.\n*If you don\u2019t want to\/can\u2019t wear a mask stay home.\n*Make sure when you wear your mask you wear it properly.\n*Practice social distancing.\n.\nIt takes everybody working together doing all the things to stop the spread of this virus.\n.\nIt\u2019s too late for my mom and dad, but Daddy was concerned for everyone else who could become infected, so everyone. Don\u2019t do something that could put someone else at risk, someone you love like I love Momma and Daddy! NOTHING IS WORTH THE RISK.\n.\nThese photos are from my wedding 21 years ago. I was the last of the four girls to get married. It was a very happy day. These are the days and ways I want back, and the way I want to remember my Momma and Daddy, happy, healthy and here.\n.\nFor those who have prayed for my family, thank you.
