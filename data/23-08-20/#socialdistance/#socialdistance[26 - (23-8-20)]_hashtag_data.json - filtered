Please keep a distance and wear a mask so that sooner than later we can all come together like we used to. Please remind others to be courteous and be respectful of those who are being extra careful.

The uptick in cases in young people is a problem that needs to be addressed, but there is a very clear line between that and perpetuating blind judgment. Your posted frustration has an impact, but likely not in the way you want. Instead of holding the individuals that aren't doing their part accountable, people unrelated end up attacked. Right now, the target is young people. Before that, it was Asians, resulting in innocent people attacked on transit or in stores. People who live and\/or work here but have different license plates are being egged and harassed!\n\nThe recent criticisms that have come about for my race and my age group have impacted how people have treated me individually throughout this pandemic, and they don't even know me. I was spat at by a man in his forties at the grocery store, and coughed on by another who thinks the pandemic is funny. I've had neighbours (plural) all older than me, that have gotten in my face and argued with me for wearing masks and a face shield and being 'sheeple'. Maskless people have approached me or my fellow masked Asian neighbours in the very small elevator, \"teasing us\" about wearing masks and face shields, or eating bats. Even though I am young, I have the capacity to understand these few horribly ignorant actions do not represent people of your race, your generation, or you.\n\nWe are all frustrated and anxious and scared. But most of us, young and old, are taking precautions not just for us, but for you. We care. The young generations still care so much. You just don't see most of us because, as recommended, we're inside or covering up our faces. Please remember we are individuals, and most of us are doing everything we can to fight alongside you in this pandemic. Don't lump us all together and treat us like the few who don't. And maybe, just don't attack people, whether or not you think you have all the facts. \n\nBe kind, be calm and be safe.\n\n#drbonniehenry #bekindbecalmbesafe #ilovebc #letsworktogether #covid19 #pandemic #wearamask #socialdistance","NumberOfLikes":6,"Hashtags":["#drbonniehenry","#bekindbecalmbesafe","#ilovebc","#letsworktogether","#covid19","#pandemic","#wearamask","#socialdistance"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Katherine Ariel Lozada on July 23, 2020.

It spoke to me, as I have not felt like myself, and I\u2019ve been calling on animals and benevolent monsters to help me connect better with my animal body, which has felt alien and unglamorous. I got sick from COVID back in March, and I\u2019m still having lingering post-COVID symptoms. I know I\u2019m not alone. I picked it up when I was in the hospital getting tests because I have a chronic illness that was acting up. My life has changed dramatically since I got sick. I am usually active, whereas now I need to rest for hours after simple tasks, like watering my garden. It takes me much longer to do my intellectual work because I cannot lift my head off the pillow sometimes. My breathing is still affected. I\u2019m so dizzy that my legs are covered in bruises from falling. I have strange neurological symptoms that alarm me. And I am very lucky because my case was relatively mild and I did not require treatment in the hospital. That said, there were three long days when I was on the precipice or calling 911 because it was so hard to breathe, and I needed to come to terms with the possibility that I might not survive. I worked through COVID, teaching online from bed, but it was hard and my students could tell I wasn\u2019t ok. Please take good care of yourselves if you\u2019re sick. Wear masks and Social distance regardless. This virus is not well-understood. Be patient with your friends and coworkers who have been affected. I\u2019m also lucky that I\u2019ve been able to teach online, offer readings online, and when I\u2019m physically able, to model online. While I haven\u2019t posted publicly before about how difficult it\u2019s been, I wanted to express my deepest gratitude for my supporters on this platform.

Especially for food and favors [who\u2019s got that, \u2018I got it, thanks\u2019 ministry? 🙊] But real talk, not waiting in what actually matters, has taught me some of the hardest life lessons. And as grateful as we are for God\u2019s grace through it all and having learned what we have as a result, the trauma of loss and its residual effects is just not worth forfeiting the value of waiting in wisdom. [Which isn\u2019t to be confused with not pursuing purpose out of fear]. Over the years, my perspective has changed so much but particularly in 2020. Waiting no longer feels like God depriving me of \u2018good\u2019 if I believe His Sovereign Love has taken into account what\u2019s best for me. Waiting is now an invitation to trust Abba in what I don\u2019t see when I\u2019ve been so eager to \u2018move things along.\u2019 And while it isn\u2019t particularly easy when circumstances won\u2019t \u2018let me be great,\u2019 I choose to trust that He will never withhold anything good from me. So if He is inviting me to wait... His plan is far better than any well thought out 5 year plan with color coordinated spreadsheets. So yes. I will wait here.

My close family in the US has also been affected.  I am seeing far too many high fives, hugging, hand shaking in public, etc.  It all seems far away until it hits you or your family.  Practice social distancing even if it\u2019s inconvenient.  Also practice fear and negativity distancing because any type of stress, worry, anger, etc. weakens the immune system so stay away from fear based media.  Build your immune system with vitamins but even more so by laughing, exercising, smiling, listening to upbeat music, etc. because health is dependent on the mind!\n\n#campbelltown #macarthur #nsw\n#focusonthesolution #inspirationalspeaker #lifecoach #lifecoaching #keynotespeaker #lifecoachinghappiness #healthcoaching #motivationalspeaker #lifecoachforwomen #laughterisgoodforthesoul #coronavirus #coronavirusitalianews #lovewins #inspiration #staypositive💯 #socialdistance #loveandlaughter #maxgarcia #australia","NumberOfLikes":93,"Hashtags":["#campbelltown","#macarthur","#nsw","#focusonthesolution","#inspirationalspeaker","#lifecoach","#lifecoaching","#keynotespeaker","#lifecoachinghappiness","#healthcoaching","#motivationalspeaker","#lifecoachforwomen","#laughterisgoodforthesoul","#coronavirus","#coronavirusitalianews","#lovewins","#inspiration","#staypositive💯","#socialdistance","#loveandlaughter","#maxgarcia","#australia"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":30,"Timestamp":1595504855,"LocalDate":"Thu Jul 23 13:47:35 CEST 2020","Location":"Hilton Surfers Paradise"},{"CaptionText":"😤🤦🏾\u200D♀️ Good Morning y\u2019all! #goodmorning#staysafe#blm#applypressure#socialdistance#neverfold#motivation#riseandshine#wakeup#grindtime#iwokeuplikethis#thankful#bless#goodmorningeverybody#riseandgrind#hustleandflow#gohardorgohome#letsgetit#hustlehard#grindharder#smile#itsThursday#tbt#smilebitch#itsabovemenow#vibesunmatched","NumberOfLikes":82,"Hashtags":["#goodmornin","#staysaf","#bl","#applypressur","#socialdistanc","#neverfol","#motivatio","#riseandshin","#wakeu","#grindtim","#iwokeuplikethi","#thankfu","#bles","#goodmorningeverybod","#riseandgrin","#hustleandflo","#gohardorgohom","#letsgeti","#hustlehar","#grindharde","#smil","#itsThursda","#tb","#smilebitc","#itsabovemeno","#vibesunmatched"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Sytira Harper-Maxwell in Atlanta, Georgia.
