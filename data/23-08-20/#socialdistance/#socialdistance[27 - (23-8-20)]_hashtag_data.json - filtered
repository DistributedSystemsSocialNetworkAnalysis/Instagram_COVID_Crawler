It's so important to maintain these connections and many of us now have a bit more time to do this! ⭐ We know your favourite gym may be closed and you can't go to your Sunday night soccer game but being physically active during this time is important for your health and wellbeing. Search YouTube to get some inspiration for workout challenges or some relaxation yoga...or just blast some music and have a dance party! ⭐ Some of us don't have work or school right now but it's important to still keep our brain stimulated.

The show addresses themes of racial inequality and urban identity, juxtaposed with capitalist paradigms. Both artists have lived and thrived in these modern-day times of cultural divides. Although from different generations, Young and Jansen have experienced irrefutable racial inequalities and prejudices firsthand. Their artwork expresses literal, as well as metaphysical, allegories of social injustice and economic inequalities, but in very distinct and unique ways.

If you have issues you can shorten the range of motion and invisibly choose a lighter weight.\n.\nYou should hold the weights by your sides as you step up.

I want to be clear that I take this virus very seriously. I have multiple people in my life who would be seriously affected if they contracted it.

I understand we are in close contact with our guests for prolonged periods of time which makes us more prone to contracting it. But our industry has been put through the ringer in this situation and we need help! Switching to outdoor services is not a solution for us. For many that is even more expenses and an even smaller client base. The majority of us have proven we can be safe and slow the rate of transmission through our spaces. We should be allowed to operate, with continued guidelines, inside our salon spaces. Those few salons with community spread should be looked into on their own to perhaps strengthen some of what the are enforcing. But the whole of us should not be punished.

Odlaziš na more, opuštaš se, zaboravljaš na brige i na posao ili se pak pajcaš u uredu ili negdje vani, ne znaš di ti je glava od vrućine i spavaš ostatak popodneva.

Iz priloženog su 4 moje fotografije u okviru, koje sada krase prijateljičinu dnevnu sobu 🥰 Čast mi je što netko smatra da su moje fotografije dovoljno vrijedne i lijepe da od toga napravi kolekciju, uokviri ih, te ih stavi na mjesto gdje ih svi koji u kuću uđu odmah i ugledaju, jer kako sam rekla, sve ovo u takvim situacijama dobiva smisao i daje mi do znanja da ne trošim vrijeme uzalud, ali i potvrđuje teoriju da se uvijek vidi kada radiš nešto što voliš ❤️\nA jučer su 3 nove fotke otišle drugoj prijateljici, no te još čekaju svoj trenutak da osvanu na zidu hodnika 😊","NumberOfLikes":58,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Valerija's Eye on July 22, 2020.","NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1595436899,"LocalDate":"Wed Jul 22 18:54:59 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"nmdlab","CaptionText":"🌳 Hacia un regreso responsable al espacio público. ✅\n.\nEn la actualidad, los espacios públicos\/abiertos se tornan en aliados estratégicos para la gradual reactivación social\/económica de las ciudades. 🖼\n.\nPromoviendo el distanciamiento físico, la cultura ciudadana y una ocupación responsable, pueden generarse intervenciones urbanas que detonen espacios de resiliencia, adaptación y prevención comunitaria. 🧍🏻\u200D♀️➖🧍🏻\n.\nDesde calles, parques, plazas, patios de escuela, hasta espacios de abiertos en empresas\/instituciones.

She sees the season in terms of a subscription-based film festival with nine shorts and six features.\n.\nThe shorts will be dance films \u2014 mostly recorded by the dancers themselves \u2014 presented on a new virtual platform on the company\u2019s website called BalletX Beyond. The features are intended to be performed live in the spring or summer, depending on public health concerns.\n.\nBalletX first shipped ballet barres and pieces of dance flooring to the dancers\u2019 homes, and now dancers are allowed to come two at a time to the studio to rehearse with choreographers and staff via Zoom. The space is separated by a divider, allowing social distancing, and this way dancers have been able to maintain their 38-week contract, and work with choreographers all over the world.\n.\nFor more on BalletX, visit the link in bio.\n.\n📸 Elizabeth Robertson \/ Staff\n.\n#socialdistance #balletx #performingarts #phillynews #phillydance #phillyreopening","NumberOfLikes":321,"Hashtags":["#socialdistance","#balletx","#performingarts","#phillynews","#phillydance","#phillyreopening"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1595430934,"LocalDate":"Wed Jul 22 17:15:34 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"lifeofjazzi","CaptionText":"Whew!!!

I let him know that wearing a mask isn\u2019t anything other than precaution and for safety, and my company mandated to wear around client meetings. He still never wore it in various meetings in last 3 months. For context, we\u2019re in North Georgia, Dawsonville area. Then, this morning he shows up with a mask with an American flag on it. 🇺🇸 I asked him what changed? And he goes, \u201CNothing, I found one I liked.\u201D 🤣 We had a good chuckle, but it\u2019s such a normal thing that I see in this industry (maybe it\u2019s the town\/area) that I\u2019m in. I get it, being around construction sites with a mask on isn\u2019t easy, but at least he showed me that a change of thinking was possible. I really thought he\u2019d never wear a mask to our meetings. No one HAS to wear it, I\u2019m just hoping everyone CHOOSES to wear it when we\u2019re near each other.
