We decided to keep the this tradition #alive while we stay home and learn. We took a walk in evening after school and took some pictures. Inaya missed being in school and her big brother was unable to play with her the whole day. She wanted to stay by Ibrahim\u2019s side the whole evening. #Fact Distance does make hearts go fonder! \n\nWe practiced #virtuallearning in the beginning of this #pandemic that gave us a good idea of what to expect. Our first day went smooth overall with some technical glitches. Ibrahim towards the end of day said \"Why I choose virtual learning again? They seemed to be having a very good time and looked like they were taking good cleaning measures.\"  \n\nHis comment made me think he was missing his school and his friends. All zoom meetings were streamed live from his classroom and it looked tempting to be around people again. Although we made the tough choice of staying home after a whole summer of thinking and Ibrahim wanting to stay home & #safe but he might be having second thoughts.  7 out of 24 students opted to stay home and picked virtual learning. \n\nWhat have you or your #child decided to do this year, are your kids staying home or going to school in person?  \n\nIf stay at home children request you to send them back to school, would you reconsider? \n\nWishing all the kids a wonderful and safe school year ahead! \n\nDream Big kiddos, sky's the limit!! \n\n@Zarakids @target @catandjack @Tilly\u2019s @apple\n\n#zoom #virtualschool #socialdistancing2020 #homegoodsfinds  #2020 #loveibrahiminaya #zarakids #target #Homegodsfinds #tbt #learn #schoolyear #kids #children #siblings #love #outdoors #summer #summer2020 #apple","NumberOfLikes":4,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597913713,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 20 10:55:13 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Great feature on @ocula.art looking at our @massisolationaus project.\n\nImage: Richard Hunt @richyeah , 'Melbourne 04' (2020) \n\u2060⠀\nTag #massisolation #massisolationAUS to participate, and follow @massisolationaus for the curated archive of the project.","NumberOfLikes":160,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by BIFB | Ballarat Foto in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia with @richyeah, @ocula.art, and @massisolationaus.

Air circulation is key, and thankfully the floor space has peak natural ventilation, with wide-open shutters, helping circulate fresh air from inside out. \n.\nThe coaches are fantastic with kindly reminding all members to be 1-2 metres apart whilst exercising, and despite all the new rules, still, make each class as enjoyable than ever. \n.\nI understand the decision about whether to return to such environments will remain knotty and personal, which all depends to some extent on how each of us balances the benefits of exercise and the possible risks of infection. But for myself who has worked in the hospital throughout the pandemic, and being mindful of the new guidelines, returning to such a normal and clean environment amongst other members was vital for me to train, disconnect from my work, and to maintain a healthy mind and body. \n.\nThank you to the fantastic team at CrossFit Colchester for opening their doors, and allowing us to train safely. \n.\nHappy lifting everyone.\n.\nDr Adnan Azad\n\n#doctorazad\n#CFC \n#CrossFitColchester\n#Colchester\n#CrossFit\n#doctor \n#bossmodelmanagement\n#keepingpeoplesafe \n#essexfashion \n#colchesterlife\n#socialdistance \n#functionalmedicine \n#eatwelllivewell","NumberOfLikes":46,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":6,"Timestamp":1597907303,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 20 09:08:23 CEST 2020","Location":"CrossFit Colchester"},{"CaptionText":"Rule No.1 in Men's Bathroom etiquette","NumberOfLikes":9,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Dr.Meme Prescriptions on August 20, 2020.

Keep in mind that these numbers are from last year, and they\u2019re free to everyone in the world who wants to see them. This means that teams can drastically change their rush\/pass ratios based on personnel and a number of different factors. Again, this is something to help you along the way. \nFor those targeting Lamar Jackson if you get sniped, just know there\u2019s plenty of value at the QB position later in drafts.\nJackson and the Ravens were ahead in many games, game script was a huge factor in their place on the list. So, this isn\u2019t saying they had a horrible passing attack (obviously not, but I gotta say it). One note about the Ravens is that when they did air it out they ranked in the top 5 in yards per reception. \nAs we get closer to our respective draft days any nugget helps. Also, as a reminder always keep your options open and stay away from zeroing in on a set strategy. Having a PLAN is great, but let numbers, talent, and opportunity help lead you. \n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n#nfl #fantasy #YourFantasyDoctor #nflmeme #QB1 #FantasyHelp #wewantfootballback #Yahoo #socialdistance #ESPN #footballplayers #league #highlights #americanfootball #sportsclips #footballvideos #fantasyhelp #footballtutor #mockdrafthelp","NumberOfLikes":56,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Fantasy Doc in NFL with @washingtonnfl, @49ers, @ravens, @vikings, and @titans.
