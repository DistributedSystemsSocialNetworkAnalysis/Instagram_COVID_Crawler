So having wildflowers & a more natural look was important to me when picking flowers and putting it together.  I even tried to convince @jsears90 to let me snip a few flowers on our walk but he didn\u2019t go for it.  I got ~5 different bouquets from Trader Joe\u2019s in Portland to start with and then I pulled them apart and paired flowers together.  So for every yellow I did a white and then I filled in the purple and red and finished it off with 3 eucalyptus evenly spaced.  Wrapping it with the floral tape and then the ribbon took 2 pairs of hands, but overall I was pleasantly surprised by how quick & easy it was to make my #bouquet \nPRO TIP: Don\u2019t use your fancy Kate Spade scissors to cut flower stems 🤣🤦🏻\u200D♀️\n\nAnd for any #brides, feel free to use my Elopement playlist. \n\nhttps:\/\/open.spotify.com\/playlist\/1TvsahKNRWuWdloxdd3qsH?si=5rHB1a3aQhOrmFwlw0-2qg\n\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n#elopementday #elopementmorning #loveisnotcancelled #loveisntcancelled #luckofthesears #pintofsears #wedding #weddings #covidbride #covidwedding #minimony #fiance #fiancé #marriage #married #newlywed #walk #lover #mylove #lovehim #lovehimsomuch #almostmrs #misstomrs #socialdistance #nikon #weddinginspiration #kiss #travel","NumberOfLikes":16,"Hashtags":["#bouquet","#brides,","#elopementday","#elopementmorning","#loveisnotcancelled","#loveisntcancelled","#luckofthesears","#pintofsears","#wedding","#weddings","#covidbride","#covidwedding","#minimony","#fiance","#fiancé","#marriage","#married","#newlywed","#walk","#lover","#mylove","#lovehim","#lovehimsomuch","#almostmrs","#misstomrs","#socialdistance","#nikon","#weddinginspiration","#kiss","#travel"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597770214,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 18 19:03:34 CEST 2020","Location":"Seaside, Oregon"},{"Owner":"jerrell_conner","CaptionText":"Started this series of \u201CPRO TIPS\u201D on #Facebook back on July 4th as a way to vent about the current political \/ social \/ racial \/ medial stories and fear flooding my media outlets... but also to open it up to friendly conversation ( NOT DEBATES - definitely not interested in #politcaldebates ). \n\nLove you all!\n\n#foodforthought #protip #politics #religion #racism #policebrutality #blm #blacklivesmatter #alllivesmatter #political #politicallycorrect #politicallyincorrect #socialism #capitalism #communism #marxists #covid19 #covid_19 #basicmath #coronavirus #partofthesolution #masks #socialdistance #partoftheproblem #president #news #meme #Trump","NumberOfLikes":4,"Hashtags":["#Facebook","#politcaldebates","#foodforthought","#protip","#politics","#religion","#racism","#policebrutality","#blm","#blacklivesmatter","#alllivesmatter","#political","#politicallycorrect","#politicallyincorrect","#socialism","#capitalism","#communism","#marxists","#covid19","#covid_19","#basicmath","#coronavirus","#partofthesolution","#masks","#socialdistance","#partoftheproblem","#president","#news","#meme","#Trump"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Jerrell The Conner🌀 on August 18, 2020 tagging @republicanparty, @thedemocrats, @rightwing.news, @theradicalleftvids, and @villainlife.official.

This was the best of both - a quick 2 hour drive from DC, out in the grand outdoors with SO MUCH space and nature to breathe fresh air, they follow all Covid precautions and cleanliness, and they have internet service 👌 We plan to go back sometime to have a full #remote #wfh week there, while still being able to relax and unwind, have a bonfire with s\u2019mores, do hikes and walks, #socialdistance yoga classes, go to bed with starry night skies and wake up to the beautiful daylight. It was a perfect weekend away from the hustle and bustle and the River Mountain crew were SO kind and accommodating.
