We are exposed to higher wavelengths like UVA and UVB radiation that can cause DNA damage 💥🔥of our skin and thus lead to skin cancers like melanoma (very aggressive and can be fatal). \u2063\n\u2063\nThere are a few articles that came out studying the effects of UVB on SARS-CoV-2 on SURFACES in laboratory settings using dried simulated saliva. It has been shown that UVB can deactivate the virus in 10-30 minutes depending on the time of day, latitude, season or DROPLET SIZE. \u2063\n\u2063\nMy take:\u2063\nI came out on FB Live earlier and reminded everyone on how it can live on surfaces for a few days and studies have claimed that it can still be infectious or even re-aerosolize. UV light may be disinfecting the outdoor surfaces this summer but this should NOT mean that you can feel safe congregating in groups during this warm season. Moreover, we are seeing horrific numbers once again during the summer months most notably in my tropical home state of Hawaii. Sitting out and tanning with your friends will not prevent you from inhaling infected droplets from others and tanning will not help you once you are infected. \u2063\n\u2063\nDr. Penny Ward (professor in pharmaceutical medicine in Kings College London) summed it up, \u201CUV radiation and heat are known to kill virus particles on surfaces. But neither sitting in the sun, nor heating, will kill a virus replicating in an individual patient\u2019s internal organs.\u201D \u2063\n\u2063\nWe are all trying to learn more about this virus together. You can form your own opinion on the matter but here is what I gathered and here is my take. \u2063\n\u2063\nTake care everyone ✌️\u2063\n\u2063\nThank you @technigadgets for the sunglasses.","NumberOfLikes":310,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Dr. Daniel Sugai, MD, FAAD on August 17, 2020.
