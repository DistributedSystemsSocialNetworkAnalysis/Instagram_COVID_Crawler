In year 22 leading up to 23 I was able to turn my Bestfriend into my boyfriend, move to a whole next state, learn more about him and his family, get our own apartment, save money, slowly but surely getting to open my own business (@noire_royal), learn how to drive not one forklift but two different types(thanks to my amazing mentor\/work mom), become a server, and now being store manager at sneaker\/clothing store, which if you know me you know I love both. All of these things have come to be from manifesting, perseverance, and overcoming my own internal struggles. I\u2019m grateful to have made it to year 23 and excited for many more years to come.

In de media horen we verschillende meningen, die elkaar soms ronduit tegenspreken. Het lijkt soms wel een battle tussen bijvoorbeeld viruswaanzin en het RIVM. Door al die verschillende meningen weten mensen niet meer wat ze moeten geloven. Het gesprek over het coronavirus lijkt zwart-wit, terwijl er juist grote grijze gebieden zijn van dingen die we nog niet zeker weten. Er is gewoon nog veel onzeker, dat is niet prettig, maar voorlopig moeten we met die onzekerheid leven.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nHet is in deze tijd verleidelijk om te roepen dat het kabinet meer maatregelen moet nemen, of juist minder. Sommige mensen worden opstandig en houden zich helemaal niet meer aan de maatregelen, anderen leven juist te veel in angst. Er is minder ruimte voor een open gesprek over dat wat we niet weten. Dat kan weer leiden tot een tunnelvisie en het versterkt het zwart-wit gesprek. \n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nIk wil mensen oproepen om niet naar anderen te wijzen, of zich te laten leiden door \u2018corona-moeheid\u2019, vakantie, recalcitrant gedrag of het zwart-wit gesprekken. Dit is een oproep om eigenaarschap te nemen, allemaal op onze eigen manier verantwoordelijkheid nemen voor onszelf en onze directe omgeving. Want ook al lijkt het misschien niet altijd zo, u heeft ook een deel van de coronacrisis en de gevolgen daarvan in uw hand.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nIn de aankomende posts zal ik bespreken hoe u eigenaarschap kunt nemen. Ik bespreek het belang van risico-inschattingen en zal ik informatie geven om die op een verantwoorde manier te maken.","NumberOfLikes":35,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597564055,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 16 09:47:35 CEST 2020","Location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands"},{"CaptionText":"#l4l #ootd #socialdistance #instagram #vscofilter #1998cam #follow #instafashion #me #japan","NumberOfLikes":52,"Hashtags":["#l4l","#ootd","#socialdistance","#instagram","#vscofilter","#1998cam","#follow","#instafashion","#me","#japan"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by 馬 on August 16, 2020 tagging @pumawomen, and @2100xtokyo.
