Hope ALL of you awesome people are great! I\u2019m rolling into the weekend encouraged and FILLED with HOPE... \n\nIt has been awhile... WOW! It\u2019s been a historical week... epically speaking. We\u2019ve seen a glass ceiling fractured with a Black woman chosen as VP candidate for the Democratic Party... FIRST EVER!!! \n\nThere\u2019s been unconventional levels of direst and distress in Chicago, the Nations 3rd largest City. \n\nA city near and dear to me as I grew up near Chicago. \n\nPortland, OR have seen nonstop demonstrations since the death of George Floyd...\n\nLittle Gianna said it best \u201CDaddy changed the world.\u201D \n\nWith ALL that\u2019s going on around us, it\u2019s important that we remain grounded; kind; loving; and forgiving.  We must remain prayerful. \n \nMany are now sending children blindly into a learning zone... OR should it be called a pandemic war zone to fight the virus without parental oversight... trusting the teachers who are concerned about their own lives to do their absolute best to keep the lives of these precious little people safe.  Can they really #socialdistance without the sturdy reminder of their own mom and dad offering oversight?! We don\u2019t know, but will find out in 24hours or maybe less... we are praying that we don\u2019t get any calls about a fever; cough; or ANY other flu-like symptom that could even point your child towards COVID-19...\n\nAnd, by now we all either know someone personally who has been impacted by the pandemic or who has succumbed to the side effects induced by the virus... #justpray \n\nThese are the signs of the times. \n\nYour story, my story, it ALL gets better... you win. \n\n#quotes #benice #love","NumberOfLikes":8,"Hashtags":["#socialdistance","#justpray","#quotes","#benice","#love"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597375525,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 14 05:25:25 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"kcmogov","CaptionText":"Check out #KCMO in this 2018 #CityHallSelfie Day #Throwback picture.

In his announcement, schools have the option of re-opening if they \"\"are in a region where the average rate of positive coronavirus tests is below 5 percent over a two-week period.\"\" This threshold was provided by the World Health Organization and some school districts have assumed this number to gauge the status of public health.

Covid isn\u2019t gone. \nLet me repeat that for the folks in the back...\nCOVID ISN\u2019T GONE!!!\nNot yet. Yesterday nearly 1500 new deaths were reported in the USA. That\u2019s the highest single day tally since mid-May üò´ü§Ø. We know respiratory droplets are the most substantial mode of transmission. We are still months out from a possible vaccine. And we know masks work! They help to prevent the spread. That\u2019s the goal. PREVENT THE SPREAD. That way kids can go back to school. That way we can get back to sports. That way the economy can build back up. \n.\nMasks have been proven to be safe time and time again. There is no substantiated evidence that says CO2 levels build up significantly when wearing a cloth mask. If you wash them, they won\u2019t get \u201Cmoldy\u201D or whatever people are trying to claim. There is no known medical condition (besides a severe skin condition like a severe facial burn) that should prevent mask tolerance. Think of it this way, you can wear a scarf in the winter to keep your face warm right? Same deal. Just different reason. There\u2019s lots of different styles of masks and you probably just need to find one that actually fits your face! These masks are not one size fits all. If you feel like you are sucking the fabric in all the time, maybe your mask is too tight. Or maybe you should try a mask bracket (see last photo...you can buy on Amazon). \n.\n.\nThis isn\u2019t about politics. It\u2019s simply about public health and looking out for your fellow mankind. Please do your part. \nLove always, Dr. J\n.\n.\n.\n#maskon #maskup #covid19 #covid_19 #educateyourself #wearamask #socialdistance #stopthespread #sports #economy #science #scienceisreal #mankind #lovethyneighbor #usa #newyorkstrong #america\n#topdoctor #drj #womeninmedicine #health #injury #healtheworld #lovemyjob #practicewhatyoupreach #nycdoctor #doctorsofinstagram #mask","NumberOfLikes":150,"Hashtags":["#maskon","#maskup","#covid19","#covid_19","#educateyourself","#wearamask","#socialdistance","#stopthespread","#sports","#economy","#science","#scienceisreal","#mankind","#lovethyneighbor","#usa","#newyorkstrong","#america","#topdoctor","#drj","#womeninmedicine","#health","#injury","#healtheworld","#lovemyjob","#practicewhatyoupreach","#nycdoctor","#doctorsofinstagram","#mask"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":10,"Timestamp":1597359931,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 14 01:05:31 CEST 2020","Location":"New York, New York"},{"Owner":"shawnkroop","CaptionText":"And this too shall pass\n#breathe\n#socialdistance \n#solitude\n#om\n#mycamp\n#rivercamp\n#trees\n#adventure\n#gooutside\n#flowstates\n#disconnect\n#reconnect\n#rewire\n#reboot\n#tuneout\n#camping \n#snowmelt\n#wimhof\n#coldplunge\n#grateful","NumberOfLikes":29,"Hashtags":["#breathe","#socialdistance","#solitude","#om","#mycamp","#rivercamp","#trees","#adventure","#gooutside","#flowstates","#disconnect","#reconnect","#rewire","#reboot","#tuneout","#camping","#snowmelt","#wimhof","#coldplunge","#grateful"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1597359911,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 14 01:05:11 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"rumaonlinerd","CaptionText":"Primer concierto con distancia social en el Reino Unido, con p√∫blico agrupado y alejado. \n\n2.500 personas acudieron al espect√°culo celebrado al aire libre y divididos en espacios delimitados\nLa actuaci√≥n del cantante Sam Fender dej√≥ im√°genes in√©ditas de la reanudaci√≥n de espect√°culos m√∫sicales tras la crisis sanitaria\nAl aire libre, agrupados en peque√±os grupos y separados por varios metros.

But I did it. 149 days of every day life for Sam Benham.\nThis post is just a taster but if you'd like to see more cd's, pictures of trees and sky and the occasional dinner\/tea, you're in luck; I've saved them all in my highlights, even migraine day.

Since we\u2019re in the middle of a pandemic, I know we\u2019re not going out without masks and eating inside! This was on a pier, so it was outside and there was plenty of room to be away from everyone AND we wore masks when we weren\u2019t eating. Now, to the rating. When I saw the waiter bring over the burger, I knew my taste buds and tummy would thank me for this delicious meal that I was about to bestow on them. This burger was oh so thick that I had to securely grab it with my two hands for safety measures. If you know me, you know I love a nice and crispy piece of bacon. This restaurant did not disappoint. This burger was so good that as I laid in bed that night, I found myself hoping it would appear in my dreams and ask me to my 2016 senior prom. I got a watermelon martini to celebrate watermelon sugar being @harrystyles\u2019s FIRST NUMBER ONE!!! It\u2019s all for you, king. These fries were crispy and thick and I wish I could\u2019ve taken some home and performed a whole skincare routine on them and made sure they got 8 hours of sleep.
