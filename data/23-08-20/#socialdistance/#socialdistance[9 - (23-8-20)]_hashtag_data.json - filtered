Why? When someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain viruses. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets or even virus if the person has the disease.''\n\nWith Keepa, when kids are not at a safe social distance in public🚎, they'll receive warnings from their Keepa. This will help kids make a habit of keeping a safe social distance. Keepa is integrated with 3 alert modes and comes with a wrist strap and lanyard for ease of use. kids can switch different alert modes and decide how to wear it as they like, making it more like a cute toy watch that is appealing to kids than a common alarm⏰. \n\n📋Learn more: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2DNluy6\n.\n.\n.\n.\n. \n#covidsafe #backtoschool #backtoschool2020 #schoolbegins #handwashing #socialdistance #socialdistancing","NumberOfLikes":6,"Hashtags":["#covidsafe","#backtoschool","#backtoschool2020","#schoolbegins","#handwashing","#socialdistance","#socialdistancing"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by TinkerGen | STEM Education on August 13, 2020.

My Tata was a voracious reader and appreciated social media-- I think he'd have been amused that thousands of people have shared his story + sweet smile online and that countless other listeners across the globe got to hear about his story and why he was so beloved. I've had strangers reach out to me that knew him directly through his work as a doctor or that just wanted to share how moved they were by his more than 60yrs of dedication to the folx in the barrios and 'hoods of South Phoenix as well as the surrounding valley. He was an OG influencer before it was a thing and certainly was a major influence on why balancing health + happiness are my passions of choice. \n\nI miss this man, mucho.\nIt's not getting easier without you Tata, I'm just continuing to grow stronger because of you... \n🎶\"Pobre de mí (Ay corazón) Pobre de mí (No sufras más) Cuánto sufre mi pecho que late tan solo por ti...\"🎶 #NPR #porunamor #restinpeace #grieving #gratiTUDE #ilovemyTata #loveinthetimeofcorona #maskup #socialdistance #BIPOC #brownfolx #healthspo #topfan","NumberOfLikes":89,"Hashtags":["#DrJGLopez","#NPR","#porunamor","#restinpeace","#grieving","#gratiTUDE","#ilovemyTata","#loveinthetimeofcorona","#maskup","#socialdistance","#BIPOC","#brownfolx","#healthspo","#topfan"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Luisa Hall Valdez on August 12, 2020.

Please take time to read.\n\nI love going to the gym and fitness in general. It's a part of me and my lifestyle. It helps me relieve stress, keep my sanity and feel better about myself.  With what's been going on in the world I had to stop going to the gym. I think its more reasonable to be carefull and try not get or spread the virus and protect your loved ones and others than a bunch of muscles. Its not easy, the gym is a very important thing for me and not being able to go it messes me up. Even though I workout regularly from home  and go for runs here and there, I still miss the gym, it's not the same. Truth is I lost a lot of muscle, i'm trying hard to maintain, to keep my cool and the itch to go. One thing is certain, when things get better and go back to normal  i'm gonna go hard and go back to where I left of and become even better. What I know for sure from the whole situation  is that i indeed grew stronger and became a better version of myself mentally. Till everything is right again, don't go left, stay safe, keep social distance, wear a mask, be grateful, be strong and be patient. The more carefull and smart we are the sooner it will all go away and we'll get back to normal.\n\n#gym #workingout #fitness #healthylifestyle  #lovethegym #loveworkingout #fitnessislife #excersiceislive #bodybuilding #rows #covid19 #coronavirus #socialdistancing #staysafe #socialdistance #stayhome #wearamask","NumberOfLikes":4,"Hashtags":["#throwbackto","#gym","#workingout","#fitness","#healthylifestyle","#lovethegym","#loveworkingout","#fitnessislife","#excersiceislive","#bodybuilding","#rows","#covid19","#coronavirus","#socialdistancing","#staysafe","#socialdistance","#stayhome","#wearamask"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597238578,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 12 15:22:58 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"これは！！😆😆😆\n#楽天 #お買いものパンダ #ソーシャルディスタンス #Tシャツ #socialdistancing #socialdistance #panda #tshirt","NumberOfLikes":43,"Hashtags":["#楽天","#お買いものパンダ","#ソーシャルディスタンス","#Tシャツ","#socialdistancing","#socialdistance","#panda","#tshirt"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ゆさ(Yuichi Sato) on August 12, 2020.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597238115,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 12 15:15:15 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"¡El ritual de @rafaelnadal, también en el golf! 😂🏌️\n\nAsí se preparaba el español, que participó de un torneo en las Islas Baleares donde finalizó cuarto. 🙌🏻\n\n📹: @fbaleargolf\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n#Nadal #rafaelnadal #toninadal #tiotoni #rafa #tennis #tenis #tennis #tenis #rafaelnadal #nadal #rafanadal #federer #djokovic #murray #andymurray #rogerfederer #roger #delpotro #delpo #training #tennismatch #socialdistance #tennispractise @tennislegend @baselinehighlights @tennisacademy101 @tennisbuilder @outsidetheball @tennisnewsmachine @2minutetennis @tennislegend @tennis.heart @this_is_tennis @hitwithme @juniortennispros @boostyourtennis @tennisways @ultimatetennis @trickshottennis @tennis..lover @connectingtennis @lovetennisuk\n@rafanadalacademy @rafaelnadal_ @we.love.rafa.nadal #golf","NumberOfLikes":642,"Hashtags":["#Nadal","#rafaelnadal","#toninadal","#tiotoni","#rafa","#tennis","#tenis","#tennis","#tenis","#rafaelnadal","#nadal","#rafanadal","#federer","#djokovic","#murray","#andymurray","#rogerfederer","#roger","#delpotro","#delpo","#training","#tennismatch","#socialdistance","#tennispractise","#golf"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Video by Ventaja Tenis in Capdepera Golf.

There is no evidence on how long the virus survives on clothes and researchers believe that the virus survives more on hard surfaces than soft surfaces such as fabric. One study states that in ideal conditions the virus can survive for up to three days on a metal\/ plastic surface and 24 hours on a cardboard surface. As for fabric, it could be similar to that of cardboard, but then there is no evidence. If you are stepping outdoors for a very short period of time and following social distancing wherever you go, then there is no real need to change your clothes when you return home. However, if you are staying out for prolonged periods of time, then it just seems like a good idea to divest yourself of the outdoors when you get home. Whether you change your clothes or not, you simply have to wash your hands thoroughly.\n#drkmh #chennai #multispecialityhospital #covid #covid19 #coronavirus #precautions #safetymeasures #wearfreshclothes #keepawayvirus #hygienic #clean #socialdistancing #socialdistance #stayhome #quarantine #flattenthecurve #wearmask #weargloves #mask #masks #hygiene #healthcare #health #staysafe","NumberOfLikes":4,"Hashtags":["#drkmh","#chennai","#multispecialityhospital","#covid","#covid19","#coronavirus","#precautions","#safetymeasures","#wearfreshclothes","#keepawayvirus","#hygienic","#clean","#socialdistancing","#socialdistance","#stayhome","#quarantine","#flattenthecurve","#wearmask","#weargloves","#mask","#masks","#hygiene","#healthcare","#health","#staysafe"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Dr. Kamakshi Memorial Hospital in Chennai, India with @dr.kamakshimemorialhospital.
