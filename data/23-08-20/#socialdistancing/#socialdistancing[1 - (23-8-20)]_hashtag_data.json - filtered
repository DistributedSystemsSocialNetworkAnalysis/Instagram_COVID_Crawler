Our sweet old guy, Rusty, crossed the rainbow bridge yesterday at the ripe old age of 17. I can\u2019t help but reflect on the  7 sweet years we were together❤️❤️❤️Jamil is not a fan of animals and is allergic, but after many tears, he relented and let me get a dog. I knew if the dog I found to adopt wasn\u2019t great (and hypoallergenic), Jamil would not be thrilled, so I prayed I could find a dog that was perfect. After searching the rescue sites like a crazed lady, I came across Rusty, who was a rescue from a puppy mill. We met him in the middle of a snowstorm at a movie theater and I instantly knew Rusty was meant to be. He was matted and half his teeth were rotted, but he was the MOST loving 10lbs. of Curly poodle fluff you could ask for. He was perfect. And when Zola was born, he became her furry sibling. Those two were always by my side, toddling around right behind me every move I made. Rusty also went to work with me and brought joy to so many of my therapy clients. He truly was a blessing. I\u2019ll miss you old boy. So much. ❤️\n(Thank you to @nylonsaddle for capturing these last photos of Rusty, Zola and I. I\u2019ll always cherish them!)\n#rusty #rainbowbridge #poodle #rescuedog #poodlesofinstagram #therapydog #family #socialdistancing","NumberOfLikes":25,"Hashtags":["#rusty","#rainbowbridge","#poodle","#rescuedog","#poodlesofinstagram","#therapydog","#family","#socialdistancing"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1598134680,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 00:18:00 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Just your typical run of the mill Saturday things with my boo @_markactual 🏎💨\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n#240sx #v8 #schassis #silvia #S14 #S13 #zenki #drift #nissan #silviaculture #stance #jdm #schassis_ #silviafanz #lsxswap #nismo #coupe #turbo #lsswap #schassissocialclub #socialdistancing #skiddy #driftmissile #drift #itsawrap","NumberOfLikes":10,"Hashtags":["#240sx","#v8","#schassis","#silvia","#S14","#S13","#zenki","#drift","#nissan","#silviaculture","#stance","#jdm","#schassis_","#silviafanz","#lsxswap","#nismo","#coupe","#turbo","#lsswap","#schassissocialclub","#socialdistancing","#skiddy","#driftmissile","#drift","#itsawrap"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598134679,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 00:17:59 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"So glad to support our favorite #jeffersonvilleindiana bar @thealcove246 - of course at 5pm w\/almost no one here [our typical jam].

Activating the presence of the expansion joint line through a confined painted area enables communities to take agency over their sidewalks while cueing walkers of safe spacing distances. \n\nThrough branding opportunities with local small businesses and community partnerships with neighborhood schools, Sensible Spacers work to weave the visual language of the sponsoring organization onto adjacent sidewalks.

Starting in the NYC Public School system, private schools, universities and many other venues, has allowed me to share what I learned as a young boy from my elders in the cotton fields in North Carolina. The truth is our music represents the oral history of our country.  The original music our beloved enslaved African brothers and sisters created, we know today as African American spirituals is the foundation of most  American music genres including Jazz, Blues, R & B, Rock, Pop, Folk, Country and Gospel. The plantation and workday song had embedded secret codes and routes on the UGRR in the music. The kids learn how the original melodies and rhythms of the enslaved Africans music were transformed during the Civil Rights Movement into Freedom Songs. I will deeply miss the time I get to spend with these amazing kids who are our future in my artist in residence programming, but until COVID 19 is over and I can go back into schools in person, we all need to stay safe. I do have a big surprise coming this Fall, so stay tuned.☮️❤️🎶 #school  #teachers #life #love #socialdistancing #socialjustice #africanamerican #africanamericanhistory #believe #goodtrouble #blacklivesmatter #justice","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#school","#teachers","#life","#love","#socialdistancing","#socialjustice","#africanamerican","#africanamericanhistory","#believe","#goodtrouble","#blacklivesmatter","#justice"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598126396,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 21:59:56 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"My mom is making cool masks!

Last week @beautifulmessartcollective had its MTP debut, showcasing all of the conceptual pieces (artwork + lifestyle essentials) they've created with intention and love, designed to elevate and bring joy to your personal space. Every piece is part of its own collection, with the purpose to question your deepest desires, and heighten your spiritual intelligence.
