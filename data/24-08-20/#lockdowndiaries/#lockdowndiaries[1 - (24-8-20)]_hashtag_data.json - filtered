Many luxuries were denied to us in the last few months due to the ongoing pandemic and one among them is the liesurely dining in your favourite restaurants. The moment I heard that Gossip Bistro has opened its doors, I wasted no time and landed up there. The restaurant has taken all safety measures recommended by the government and WHO. It wasn't crowded at all to my delight and there were good distance between tables. The fare and the hospitality was as usual top notch led by the bistro owner himself. My only grouse is that there was no air conditioning but that's the norm these days, instead there were portable fans all around making the dining comfortable. I was told that the seafood was fresh..hence I opted for the same. \n\nThe dishes I had were:\n\n* Prawn Olivetti (Stir fried prawns in olive oil with garlic, chilli flakes, olives, lime juice & coriander)\n* Chilli Seafood (Mixed seafood stir fried in an Asian black sauce with peanut rice)\n* Tres Leches (A butter sponge cake soaked in condensed milk and whipped cream, served with custard sauce and topped with tropical fruits)\n* Beverage: Lemon Mint Mojito\nAnd finally ended the fare with a wonderful Espresso. \nFood rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nI took my own time in relishing the fare, enjoyed it immensely and I can't wait to go back again. This place is highly recommended to break your lockdown reclusion.\n\n#Foodgasm #FoodLover #Foodie #Foodpic #FoodPhotography #Foodiegram #Instafood #InstaFoodie #ChennaiFoodie #FoodPorn #August2020 #Foodgram #FoodgramIndia #WhereChennaiEats #Yummy #Yummylicious #YummyinmyTummy #Foodstagram #FoodsofInstagram #Seafood #GoodFood #EatWell #LiveWell #EatHealthy #FoodTalkIndia #FoodBlogFeed #NammaChennai #ECR #LockdownDiaries #Justadriveaway","NumberOfLikes":26,"Hashtags":["#Foodgasm","#FoodLover","#Foodie","#Foodpic","#FoodPhotography","#Foodiegram","#Instafood","#InstaFoodie","#ChennaiFoodie","#FoodPorn","#August2020","#Foodgram","#FoodgramIndia","#WhereChennaiEats","#Yummy","#Yummylicious","#YummyinmyTummy","#Foodstagram","#FoodsofInstagram","#Seafood","#GoodFood","#EatWell","#LiveWell","#EatHealthy","#FoodTalkIndia","#FoodBlogFeed","#NammaChennai","#ECR","#LockdownDiaries","#Justadriveaway"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598198166,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 17:56:06 CEST 2020","Location":"Gossip Fusion Bistro & Dessert Bar"},{"Owner":"nishamalkani","CaptionText":"Simran\u2019s 6 th bday .With fancy cake made by dhruv.

In everything they do, i feel that they just do it with their whole heart, cheerfully. Almost about a year ago, I was seriously interested in keeping a journal. I tried to get some inspiration from the really aesthetic ones and after spending some days in trying to find one, Shaheen, a very sweet friend of mine from Pakistan suggested me to have a look at @ohareeba and @noor_unnahar 's instagram handle. And that was it. Since then, they have really been an inspiration. Also, I don't know how to express my love for Noor's poetry.\n \nAnyway, this is one of my favourite from the journal which I had made almost a year back. I took this idea from Areeba's youtube tutorial on art journal and tried giving it a twist with one of my favourite quote. Also, after fifteen to twenty pages, I couldn't complete my journal last year as I had to get back to my studies. Thanks to this quarantine period which really helped me in using all these free time to complete my journal. I'm grateful to everyone who have been inspiring me everyday. It's really worth the time because it helped me in many ways to keep me busy and distracted from negative stuffs. And yes, I'll also post some of my favourite ones after I complete editing the final look 🌻❤\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n#writingcommunity#journaling#journalinspiration#artsandaesthetics#quarantinemood#lockdowndiaries#quarantinetimes#areebasiddique#noorunnahar#noorunnaharpoetry#journalcommunity#instagramers#postup#gratitudepost#moodygrams#instagramdaily#feeds#instagram","NumberOfLikes":104,"Hashtags":["#writingcommunit","#journalin","#journalinspiratio","#artsandaesthetic","#quarantinemoo","#lockdowndiarie","#quarantinetime","#areebasiddiqu","#noorunnaha","#noorunnaharpoetr","#journalcommunit","#instagramer","#postu","#gratitudepos","#moodygram","#instagramdail","#feed","#instagram"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1598174292,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 11:18:12 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"mistertaxman","CaptionText":"Where we would have been during Lockdown if we didn\u2019t have the iPad to keep us occupied during COVID19?\n\nWill the kids stay on them the full 366 days this year? \n\nPS Nothing gets past lil Zoe\n\n#LarryLuckdown #MtMarthaLeprechaun #LarryLockdown #COVID19 #lockdown #lockdownlife #lockdown2020 #lockdowndiaries #leprechaun #leprechauninthehood #leprechaunsmademedoit #MountMartha #MountMarthaLeprechaun #VictoriaLockdown  #ScreenTime #iPad #technology #techneck #technecksyndrome #ipadaddict","NumberOfLikes":16,"Hashtags":["#LarryLuckdown","#MtMarthaLeprechaun","#LarryLockdown","#COVID19","#lockdown","#lockdownlife","#lockdown2020","#lockdowndiaries","#leprechaun","#leprechauninthehood","#leprechaunsmademedoit","#MountMartha","#MountMarthaLeprechaun","#VictoriaLockdown","#ScreenTime","#iPad","#technology","#techneck","#technecksyndrome","#ipadaddict"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598174176,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 11:16:16 CEST 2020","Location":"Mount Martha, Victoria, Australia"},{"Owner":"mandy.freeman","CaptionText":"The Lockdown Diaries \n\nIt's a new week filled with new opportunities.

I also tidy up my entire plastic model collection. I now have a sizable PlaMo wall. I now have a total of 130 kits counting the add ons(65 Bandai and Kotobukiya kits, 65 Bootleg kits). As much as I want to use this as my background for my online classes, my parents thought it wouldn't send a good message to anyone who'd see. So I had to clean them up and set up an angle of my room where they would see my small bookshelf instead of my boxes. I strongly believe this would show that I'm doing my own art that is different from my writing. I believe that PlaMo building in itself is a form of art and performance. I know I'm not doing any recolors or drastic color change on my kits but I'm getting there. I'd just have to invest on a small compressor and airbrush set and I'll be ready. I've been planning to do so but some things don't always go your way. Still, this clean up allowed me to look into my hobby not just as a hobby but a lifestyle; something that you have to invest time and resources in order to be good at. Salute to my fellow builders out there! \nFor now, allow me to put these boxes back.\n.\n.\n.\n#abuilderslife\n#plamobuilder \n#plasticmodels \n#gunpla \n#gunplabuilder \n#gunplaislyf \n#gundamsofinstagram\n#bandai\n#kotobukiya\n#zoids\n#zoidsofinstagram\n#happykid\n#lockdown \n#lockdowndiaries \n#stayhome \n#stayhealthy","NumberOfLikes":13,"Hashtags":["#abuilderslife","#plamobuilder","#plasticmodels","#gunpla","#gunplabuilder","#gunplaislyf","#gundamsofinstagram","#bandai","#kotobukiya","#zoids","#zoidsofinstagram","#happykid","#lockdown","#lockdowndiaries","#stayhome","#stayhealthy"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Simon Pablo Reyes Felismino in Marikina City.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598101695,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 15:08:15 CEST 2020","Location":"Marikina City"},{"Owner":"misi_13_13","CaptionText":"Happy Ganesh Chaturthi !! \nGanpati Bappa Morya !\n.\n.\n.\n#chalokarekuchhatke #ganpatibappamorya  #ganeshchaturthi #ganeshchaturthi2020 #lockdowndiaries #homemade #ganesha #victory #ladoo #pede #laddoopede #august22 #papa'sbday","NumberOfLikes":8,"Hashtags":["#chalokarekuchhatke","#ganpatibappamorya","#ganeshchaturthi","#ganeshchaturthi2020","#lockdowndiaries","#homemade","#ganesha","#victory","#ladoo","#pede","#laddoopede","#august22","#papa'sbday"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Mihika on August 22, 2020 tagging @shalinirohatgi, @themihikarohatgi, and @misi_13_13.

This lockdown has gotten the best and the worst out of me.\n\nOn one hand, it has taught me the importance of keeping oneself busy, indulging in new hobbies, and the importance of friendships. At the same time, it has multiple times made me feel caged, suffocated, brought out the worst anxieties in me, and something I'd never ever experienced before - anger\/rage attacks. \n\nI find myself losing control of myself at the smallest of things, feel such a strong bout of anger that I just want to throw things and scream at the top of my voice. Usually happens in interactions with my closest people. And I often end up pushing them away by this behaviour. \n\nI'm often told that I'm overreacting, that this is my strategy to shut them up, or a way to blackmail them to get things done my way. And that angers me even more.\n\nI've always been a short tempered, impatient and impulsive person, but I didn't know that it could come out in ways like these. It also leads to feelings of guilt and shame for lashing out on people that I love the most and making them go through hell. But I don't know how to help it.\n\nI'm trying though. I'm taking baby steps. Like taking deep breaths as soon as I see my temper rising, meditating, and exercising. It isn't easy but I'll get there.\n\nI'm putting this out here solely because I'm sure many of you are facing similar situations, where people around you are unable to understand what you're going through. This is to tell you that it's okay if people don't get you. It doesn't matter. What matters is for you to realise and accept that there is something that you need to do to break the cycle, and change those unhealthy behaviours.\n\nIt's not going to be easy. And it's not going to happen overnight. But it'll happen. The only person who needs to have faith in you is YOU. And all you gotta do is take baby steps, and you'll get there. \n\nWhenever I feel caged, I go to my terrace, put on some Frank Sinatra tunes, and enjoy the sunset.

Our Friday series aims to motivate fellow runners and fitness enthusiasts by spreading stories of people who continue to stay motivated through the lockdown.\n\nHere is how Coach Shivangi Sarda ( @fitness.trail ) turned the limitations of the lockdown to her advantage.\n\n\"Covid-19 was sudden & it came with a lot of uncertainty.\nIt's not easy to stay motivated & disciplined with no specific goal\/ events to look forward to. I took this as an opportunity to work on my strength & experience different forms of fitness.I have a fixed plan when I am training for events,but this time gave me a chance to try new ways to improve my fitness. I used my time for indoor rides, strength training , military fit training, mobility work & started practicing yoga which has helped me become stronger. Before the lockdown, I was facing some knee pain so I worked on strengthening & rehab.\nNow I am back to outdoor running & rides and I continue to follow my routine from lockdown which includes strength & yoga sessions.\n\nThere were days when it was challenging to get myself to workout but then I thought to myself that this is a good time to work on my overall fitness & it's going to help me when things are back to normal :) \" - @fitness.trail \n.\nHave a similar story that you want to share?

It is a real charmer when dressed up with homemade thick custard and piped, chantilly cream. It adds an honest flavour with its rich sweetness and spongy caramelised texture, suggestive of a splendid dessert. Doubly so, it can be quietly savored at tea time. \n.\nServed with a superior vanilla ice cream, this should clinch the deal for a refreshing summery dessert. This swoony South African classic never becomes outdated. Pudgy berries are a prerequisite for it\u2019s many nutrients and its sweet-tart flavour to offset the sweetness, although any seasonal fruit may be used. \n. \nIt would be considered rude to decline these marvelous saucy puds. The only honorable thing to do, is brew a pot of tea and dispense plates around the table. \n.\nThis recipe is from my ebook - In the Kitchen with Paz, to shop, click the link in bio\n.\nFollow @foodiesof_cakewalk for more photos and ideas\/recipes.

Also these days the energy of the Ganga close to her source in her high monsoon season is otherworldly. Strangely enough, I could not think of any wish to make...what can I possibly ask for, when the world is in similar storm to the nature around me now?

Now restrictions have been lifted, the pre-recorded weekly Zoom interviews are designed to provide insight into how our community of survivors are managing in the pandemic as a whole. A clip of each already posted to the DS channels is also posted to our feed to briefly introduce our wonderful Instagram audience and to give everyone a taster of personal affiliation with each survivor!\n\nLockdown interview number fourteen features stroke survivors Sheelagh and Andrew. Sheelagh is our Administrator at Different Strokes. She had her stroke in 2018 at the age of 51. Andrew had 3 haemorrhagic strokes in 2000 aged just 21. He takes us back to the start and through the progress he\u2019s made learning to walk and talk again, along with his aspirations and a heartwarming story how his goal was to get on one knee to propose to his now wife. He talks about the different types of brain injury he saw in rehab; the activities, treatments and physio he endured in his time there and the problems that have evolved because of his strokes - such as visual issues, epilepsy which is now controlled, fatigue and a permanent loss of feeling and movement in his arm. He discusses his struggles with Aphasia, reading and writing, how that affected his self assurance and relationships, and he explains about how casual talk with people was the best therapy. \n\nAndrew works in a school at lunchtime and continued this with key worker\u2019s kids during lockdown.

Sharing one such with all of you on this amazing day of photography.\n.\nThis mosque in the photograph, was built in 1835 at Tollygunge by Prince Ghulam Muhammad, the youngest son of Tipu Sultan. However, he built another mosque near Dharmatala road of Kolkata around 1842.

This place is 4mins away from my Home in Kolkata where I am born, raised and choose to call my home no matter where I stay. Will talk about the historical nuances of this place some other day.

Now, Elizabeth who is in her 30s is an amazing interior designer but leads a mundane life mostly shaped by her solitary lifestyle. With Ivan's entry, her otherwise monotonous days started filling in with colors. But like any miracle, it is short-lived and gone for good after the job is done.\n\nOn a personal note, I walked with the character of Elizabeth, the author brilliantly describes every detail that I unknowingly dwelled in it throughout my read.

Then horror which we used to read in past came in reality for this generation... Pandemic. \nLockdown was imposed in short interval notice and in a snap sound of fingers, many found themselves jobless, trapped inside. Privileged as me just had to get ourselves keep confined to our spaces. Real struggle was for them whose life started daily with sunrise and bread earned by long day hard work. Now there was no work.\nAs a photographers' perspective, shoots got cancelled, project delayed or denied. After a few days of not shooting, we started searching way to pursue passion. Business meetings started on conference video calls. Few photographers came with a temporary solution of shooting on video calls. Facetime shoots, WhatsApp Call shoots, Google video shoots, Skype shoot came in existence... in a shell, Virtual Shoots. Ofcourse not good as actual shoot, but \"...dil ko khush rakhne ko ghalib ye khayal achchha hai...\", it became a trend amongst photographers.\nAfter initial denial, me too thought to give it a try. Talked to few people connected with me. Now I am sharing few results. \nI won't call myself as Photographer for these shots, just a director. \n--- \u2022\u2022\u2022 ---\nIn picture: @itsharshitaagarwal\n--- \u2022\u2022\u2022 ---\n#virtual #shoot #virtualshoot #facetime #facetimephotoshoot #whatsapp #videocall #portrait_vision #pictureoftheday #photooftheday #pursuitofportraits #portrait_today #portrait_mood #portraitphotography #portrait_shots #portraiture #mood #moodygrams #snapseed #lockdowndiaries #lockdown #coronatime #portraitvision_ #pr0ject_uno #pr0ject_soul #portraitphotographer #bluedenim #relaxing #denim #relax","NumberOfLikes":37,"Hashtags":["#virtual","#shoot","#virtualshoot","#facetime","#facetimephotoshoot","#whatsapp","#videocall","#portrait_vision","#pictureoftheday","#photooftheday","#pursuitofportraits","#portrait_today","#portrait_mood","#portraitphotography","#portrait_shots","#portraiture","#mood","#moodygrams","#snapseed","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdown","#coronatime","#portraitvision_","#pr0ject_uno","#pr0ject_soul","#portraitphotographer","#bluedenim","#relaxing","#denim","#relax"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597763368,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 18 17:09:28 CEST 2020","Location":"India"},{"Owner":"shutterupphoctory","CaptionText":"#inbetweenshots #lockdowndiaries\nOn Frame: Ananthi Natrajan","NumberOfLikes":35,"Hashtags":["#inbetweenshots","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597762648,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 18 16:57:28 CEST 2020","Location":"Tycoon Resort"},{"Owner":"my_postmaker","CaptionText":"Independence Day special.
