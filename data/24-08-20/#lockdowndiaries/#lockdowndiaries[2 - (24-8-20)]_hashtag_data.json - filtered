I usually start while I\u2019m preparing breakfast. Our everyday bread for the children is a very simple white loaf that I make in my KitchenAid. This is a recipe I\u2019ve been using on and off for 13 years, and is adapted from \u2018The Cook\u2019s Companion\u2019 by Stephanie Alexander. \n\nI use 1kg bread flour, 2 tbsp olive oil, 1 tbsp dry yeast, 1tsp salt and 600ml warm water. Throw it all into the bowl of the mixer and knead with the dough hook for ten minutes. Move the dough to a large oiled bowl, cover with a tea towel, and leave to rise for about an hour. Knock the dough back, divide in half and place in two oiled bread tins to rise another 30-45 mins. Bake at 220c for 25 mins. You can remove the loaves from the tins for the last five minutes of baking for a crunchier crust.\n\nI\u2019ve made this recipe using 20% wholemeal flour and 100% wholemeal and they both work well. If you want to use 100% wholemeal you may need to bake a little longer. \n\nI make pizza dough once a week for lunches, and once or twice a week I may also make buns or another bread. This morning I tried this Milk Bun recipe from @locallovely \u2018s \u2018A Basket by the Door\u2019. (This is an amazing cookbook by the way, one of my favourites!)\n\nNeither my husband or I can actually eat any of these breads I regularly bake. I\u2019m hoping to begin experimenting with gluten-free sourdough soon, but for now I make a GF cornbread every few weeks and Evan snacks on that. \n\nThe best bread that you can eat, health wise, is a long-fermented sourdough loaf. I have had seasons of regularly baking sourdough, but I\u2019ve had to accept that in my current season I can\u2019t keep a starter alive. These simple yeast breads fit into my daily routine, only require about ten minutes of hands-on preparation time, and are still a much better choice nutritionally than store bought loaves. (I\u2019d rather not feed my kids soy flour, vegetable oils and questionable additives, thanks!)\n\nLet me know your favourite bread to bake, and also if you\u2019d like more posts like this, sharing some of the details of how we feed a large family. ☺️","NumberOfLikes":101,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":22,"Timestamp":1597714249,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 18 03:30:49 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"OOoppsy! 💛💫\n\n#lockdowndiaries #lockdownselfie #lockdownselfie😜😜","NumberOfLikes":8,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597712691,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 18 03:04:51 CEST 2020","Location":"Home"},{"CaptionText":"It's the first day of the \"Stay at Home\" order here in the USVI.

So I decided to do a 'home retreat'.\n\nWhat a beautiful experience in the comfort of my own home. In Chantal fashion, of course I had an itinerary as well (happy to share)😅\n\nI got to teach my very first Yin Yoga class online followed by an Energy Healing guided meditation that was so calming and ended off with 'safe space' chats. After this, I had the best sleep in weeks. And this absolutely set the tone for the weekend.\n\nI nourished my body with good food, did a 2hr online yoga workshop, read, journaled, meditations, YouTube dance class, core workout, mindfulness & self love session, facial, hand & hair treatment, body scrubs with relaxing lavender salt baths and soulful catch up with a friend.\n\nOne of my highlights was reading this beautiful book 'Wake up to the Joy of You' by @agapisees which gives you great tools for practising mindfulness and definitely the perfect read for that moment.\n\nOverall a huge success and feeling very grateful for the gift of life, my people, mental health, my home, opportunities, love & simply just the little things 🙌\n#retreatyourself #homeretreat #stayhome #lockdowndiaries #yoga #yogalife #yogalove #yogacapetown #yogasouthafrica #wellness #nutrition #skincare #investinyourself #journaling #intentionalliving #loveliveshere #mindfulness #mindbodysoul #selflove #selfcare #gratitude #littlethings #mentalhealth #blessed #godisgood #liveagoodlife #turnanewleaf #livelaughlove","NumberOfLikes":53,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by c h a n t a l   b o s c h in Cape Town Southern Suburbs, Cape Town.","NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1597705259,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 18 01:00:59 CEST 2020","Location":"Cape Town Southern Suburbs, Cape Town"},{"CaptionText":"You\u2019d think that a \u201Csalad\u201D like this was easy peasy to throw together but average Burrata caprese salads feature on menus quite often.

Even prior to panel lines and the yellow and some grey paints. I'm having a hard time looking for an HG Abyss Gundam and my other others won't be arriving anytime soon so I think I should start building my other HG kits. I'm not in the mood for another big kits after finishing these Ligers. Having a hobby that doesn't require me to look at a screen is really refreshing nowadays.

I felt like I had woken up from a long sleep and had missed a season because it honestly feels like yesterday I was walking the same park watching the autumn leaves fall from the trees.

I come from a big, close family - and being away from them was really difficult. \n\nI remember one time, I was walking through a shopping centre outside London, and suddenly I felt a wave of uncontrollable emotion rush over me. I stood in the middle of the walkway, and cried. It was unexpected (and let\u2019s face it, a little awkward), but I couldn\u2019t control it. I missed home.\n\nI may be at home now, but I\u2019ve felt those waves a lot lately. Because a home isn\u2019t just about the four walls and roof over our heads. A home isn\u2019t just about the scenery we take for granted every day as we go about our lives. A home isn\u2019t just about the things that make it a place to feel secure and safe. \n\nHome, for me, is about people. The people who make my little place in the world feel content, warm and comforting. Like home. \n\nMy Mum\u2019s cooking that instantly injects me with love and my Dad\u2019s ridiculous jokes that have us rolling our eyes and laughing simultaneously. That feels like home. \nMy little brothers and sisters, our dynamic and our banter\u2026 that\u2019s home.\nSeeing my beautiful friends, and drinking bubbles, talking our heads off, practicing impossible TikTok dances, and dancing on tables as we laugh all night\u2026. that\u2019s home. \nWaking up before the sun each day, jumping in the car to the gym and moving my body with people who uplift and inspire me\u2026 that\u2019s home. \nSeeing my children play with their friends, and run through our house laughing and playing with their little buddies\u2026 that\u2019s home. \nPopping across or down the road to my neighbours\u2019 house for a quick cup of tea and a chat (or a cheeky Friday champagne)\u2026 that\u2019s home. \nSeeing my nieces and nephews, and the children of my beautiful friends grow up and play with my kids... that\u2019s home. \nWalking through our village on a Sunday when the Farmer\u2019s Market is on - buying local produce and seeing cafes so busy their customers are spilling out on the streets as they happily waiting for their coffee in the sunshine\u2026. that\u2019s home. \n\n(Continued in comments)....","NumberOfLikes":62,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":40,"Timestamp":1597658938,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 12:08:58 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"@juhi168 reached out to us from Bangalore amidst the lockdown with one wish.

Due to him starting his exercise regime again he is loving the fact the fitness tracker also has a stopwatch so no more having to have his phone with him, it also keeps track of his heart rate and how many calories he has burnt. \nTonight he is going to try the sleep tracker for the first time.

And it makes you think what am I doing? How am I contributing? \n\nIf you ever felt that way at some point during this lockdown, please know that you can help by following the rules and staying at home. So please make sure you stay indoors, take care of your family and support your loved ones. Reach out (on your phone) to your loved ones. This lockdown will be easier if you have someone to communicate with. There is no better time than this to reach out to someone and be there for someone.\u201D\n\nThank you @sadon_lhamo for these lovely words.

If you were, you wouldn\u2019t have anything to strive for. You have this one life to pursue your dreams. If you get the urge to create something with your life, do it! \n\nSometimes the tougher the circumstances are in our life, the more of a catalyst those circumstances will become in pushing us to fight for our dream.\n\nWhen you find that burning desire to be or do something, you\u2019ve found a powerful force that can cut through seemingly impossible circumstances and limitations.\n\nFor me passion is purpose. It\u2019s that desire to be someone or to do something. It moves you like nothing else in life. It\u2019s something you\u2019re attracted to, something you\u2019re passionate about and it fills you with joy and sets your heart on fire when you do it.\n\nTravelling fills me with joy and ignites my passion for living to the fullest on this planet. When I am not travelling I am always researching, browsing and planning to travel. It\u2019s always on my mind and in my spirit. \n\nIstanbul is one city I have visited a couple of times and yet there is so much left to see and explore. Love the mix of classic royal ottoman culture, modern day Europeanised influences, Islamic art, the delicious Turkish cuisine and the grand charming palaces on the steps of Bosphorus river. I simply cannot wait to travel to Turkey 🇹🇷 again. \n\nOnce the world finally gets a handle on this deadly pandemic I will forever be grateful for a chance to travel again in peace. \n\n#travel #travelgram #instatravel #tourism #passportready #wanderlust #besties #forever #ilovetravel #passionpassport #suitcasetravels #traveldeeper #iamatraveller #discoveries #forbestravelguide #passion #travelislife #travelispassion #ciragan #palace #kempinski #istanbul #turkey #ottoman #empire #lockdowndiaries #postlockdowngoals #travelgoals #memories #travelmemories","NumberOfLikes":47,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by wanderlustbestiesforever🦋 in Ciragan Palace Kempinski Istanbul.

We have not met each other yet. I don\u2019t know how will it be to look at them for the first time, I don\u2019t know how will it be to meet them for the first time, I don\u2019t know how will it be to kiss them for the first time, I don\u2019t know how I will feel when my arms will be holding them so tight. As I think about them and these sublime feelings I get goose bumps. \nOur first date will be at their favorite coffee shop, sipping on their favorite coffee, having endless conversations about life, music and adventures. We are two different people: they like eating healthy and I like eating all the unhealthy food I can find. Our idea of life is different, but who cares as long as we are having fun. We are two souls lost in the casual imagination of life, protecting our hearts from the complexity of love.

Mine\u2019s not nearly as tasty as my gran\u2019s, but making this dessert refreshes my memory of my happy childhood every time and that gladdens my heart.

Liquor stores will be allowed to sell alcohol from Monday to Thursday during 9am to 5pm. 🍻 We all learned our lesson to stock up on drinks, like the french did and not on toilet paper 😋. \n\n*Restrictions on the sale of tobacco will be lifted, after 5 months. As a non smoker I can only guess how the people must be feeling right now, beeing able to buy their cigarettes legally again. \n\n*Restrictions on family and social visits will also be lifted. \n\nThe following restrictions will remain:\n\n*Borders remain closed.\n\n*No gatherings of more than 50 people will be permitted.\n\n*Spectators will not be permitted at sporting events. Guess we really won't make it this year to a Rugby event, which was on our to do list for our time here.\n🙄\n*The curfew will remain between 10pm and 4am. That's fine for us 😴\n\n*Masks obligatory\n\nThank you Mr President Cyril Ramaphosa. 👏🏼We are so ready for Level 2.\n\n#geschwisterliebe #brotherhood #jungenmama  #momslife #momofboys #capetownmom #lockdown2020 #lockdownsa #lockdowndiaries #livingatthebeach #level2 #onedaycv #coronavirusapocalypse \n#photooftheday #instagood","NumberOfLikes":43,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Karin Clap-sya in Capetown, Southafrica.

Then horror which we used to read in past came in reality for this generation... Pandemic. \nLockdown was imposed in short interval notice and in a snap sound of fingers, many found themselves jobless, trapped inside. Privileged as me just had to get ourselves keep confined to our spaces. Real struggle was for them whose life started daily with sunrise and bread earned by long day hard work. Now there was no work.\nAs a photographers' perspective, shoots got cancelled, project delayed or denied. After a few days of not shooting, we started searching way to pursue passion. Business meetings started on conference video calls. Few photographers came with a temporary solution of shooting on video calls. Facetime shoots, WhatsApp Call shoots, Google video shoots, Skype shoot came in existence... in a shell, Virtual Shoots. Ofcourse not good as actual shoot, but \"...dil ko khush rakhne ko ghalib ye khayal achchha hai...\", it became a trend amongst photographers.\nAfter initial denial, me too thought to give it a try. Talked to few people connected with me. Now I am sharing few results. \nI won't call myself as Photographer for these shots, just a director. \n--- \u2022\u2022\u2022 ---\nIn picture: @dikshadesire\n--- \u2022\u2022\u2022 ---\n#virtual #shoot #virtualshoot #facetime #facetimephotoshoot #whatsapp #videocall #portrait_vision #pictureoftheday #photooftheday #pursuitofportraits #portrait_today #portrait_mood #portraitphotography #portrait_shots #portraiture #mood #moodygrams #snapseed #lockdowndiaries #lockdown #coronatime #portraitvision_ #pr0ject_uno #pr0ject_soul #portraitphotographer #couch #red #faceshot #expression","NumberOfLikes":37,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597505708,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 17:35:08 CEST 2020","Location":"India"},{"CaptionText":"Cup of Joe🤎☕\n\n#coffeelover #coffeeaddict #barristalife #espressolove  #caffeinedaily #coffeefirst #coffeeoclock #elixir is #coffeequotes #coffeesesh #coffeemania #coffeemaniac #coffeeeveryday #lockdowndiaries  #coffeeaddict  #caffeineaddict #caffeinated  #coffeesesh #cofeelovers #coffeewoman #capuchino","NumberOfLikes":5,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by bronzed_affair on August 15, 2020.

She\u2019s small, and very funny! 💚\nToday we read Lauren Child\u2019s ( @laurenchildthatsme ) fab book \u201CI am too absolutely small for school!\u201D\nI\u2019d avoided this book for a while because in it Lola expresses concerns about school that my Lottie doesn\u2019t seem to have 👍🏻 and I didn\u2019t want her to start thinking she should be worried!\nHowever, what I really enjoy about this book is Lola\u2019s imaginary friend Soren Lorensen! He\u2019s used by Lola as a way of talking about her anxieties.\nThis brought up interesting discussions about underlying emotions (eg that we can be mainly excited about school but may also be a little nervous and that\u2019s ok!).\nWe also talked about the fact that someone can look and be happy but also be feeling other things too.\nWe pulled different faces and used our imaginary friend to show our underlying feeling. \n(I haven\u2019t included pictures of the kids in this one because I was too busy chatting and playing with them to take photos! But you can see what we were up to none the less.)\n🎨 I drew the outline of Soren Lorensen\u2019s face on a clear plastic wallet in chalk pen.\n🎨 Then the Littles drew on the expression.\n🎨 Then we held the plastic up to the light and it created a subtle outline shadow of our friend! I just loved the effect and the kids thought it was brilliant!\n💭 Today, apparently one Little is feeling \u201Ccalm but underneath happy too\u201D. The other said she would feel \u201Cso excited at school but under that a bit sad too to leave Mummy and Daddy\u201D.\nI was so impressed at the discussions this created and the emotional intelligence they showed.\n\nThe last sentences of the book:\n\u201C...I know Charlie, I was not worried. It was Soren Lorensen who was nervous, not me. I was fine.\u201D 💚\n\n#charlieandlola #startingschoolclub #startingschool #startingschool2020 #startingschoolbooks #reception #preschool #preschoolactivities #preschoolathome #preschooler #allabouttheearlyyears #eyfsideas #eyfs #eyfsinspiration #eyfsactivities #emotionalintelligence #emotionalhealth #emotionalwellbeing #seperationanxiety #earlyliteracy #mumsupportingmums #teachermum #mumlifeuk #kidsbookswelove #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":42,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":11,"Timestamp":1597406067,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 14 13:54:27 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"A @voizz_of_ink review - When you're the only girl in the gang Part-2 @poornima_ravii @balaji.sha.g @charan_chic @ajith_kumar_ist @srijith.ramachandran @always._.trip.soul @_araathi_fan_page_ @araathi_ponnu_fan_page @poornimaravii_araathi_fanpage @poor_n_i_ma_ravi_fans_page @araathi_fans_club @araathifans #girl #girls #boy #boys #boyswillbeboys #boystyle #girlpower #friends #friendship #friend #friendzone #friendsforever #friendshipquotes #friendshipgoals #friendshipbracelets #friendzone #friendstvshow #friendshipgoals💕 #friends👭 #lockdown #lockdown2020 #lockdownlife #lockdowncooking #lockdowndiaries #lockdownhouseparty #lockdownmemes #lockdownbirthday","NumberOfLikes":37,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by voizz_of_ink on August 14, 2020 tagging @srijith.ramachandran, @poornima_ravii, @charan_chic, @balaji.sha.g, @ajith_kumar_ist, and @always._.trip.soul.

Four people in my family including myself got infected with the Coronavirus at different times in the past 5 months, all successfully recovered now. The virus debilitated my body and left me with a kind of fatigue I was not prepared for. Dancing was a far-fetched goal, it was a task to get basic chores done without feeling breathless. As dancers, we are not used to feeling weak in the body and we are always trying to increase our stamina, strength and longevity. The exhaustion that follows a good practise session gives us deep satisfaction and we not only express through our body, we also \u2018think and feel\u2019 from it. Hungry to dance again but sensing my body is not strong enough to support the flights my mind was taking was heartbreaking to say the least. On 1st August, I finally pushed myself to record a dance video for a project I was part of. I was very scared that I would be able to dance for long hours for it. But I did it. Even though it took more effort to dance than before, looking at myself in the mirror in full costume and makeup reminded me again of my identity as a dancer. It taught me that in life my body will continue to go through ups and downs; but my dance will always live within me, and my body will always be my instrument to express and share my art with the world.\n\n@siddhigoelkathak is a Kathak dancer and teacher based in New Delhi. She is a disciple of Guru Pandit Jai Kishan Maharaj. Co-founder of \u2018Amaltas Curations\u2019, she holds a Masters degree in Arts & Aesthetics, from JNU. Her major interest lies in situating performance in urban\/cityscapes, & exploring movement & vulnerability. She shares a dance piece, Reunion, recently shot for ImmerseGo.

To yourself or to others? Have these words lost their meaning because of the constant use and no sign of anything getting better? I say this to everyone who is troubled in these times, which is everyone. And I caught myself saying this to a friend the other day and realising that it sounded hollow and even though I meant it I don't think my words had any hope in them. But that doesn't mean that I've lost hope, maybe I have, but what is life without positivity? When corona first struck, I remember being this positive person, bright as the sun, but as days went by, I also remember times of despair and feeling absolutely lost. But what matters is how much good you can get out of a bad situation. And how important it is to have even the tiniest bits of positivity. So, yes, I do hope that it does get better soon. Yes, hope is a strong word but it is also what keeps us going. Keep hoping.\n\n#lockdowndiaries #delhi #lifeinametro #photooftheday #nikon \n#sunriseorsunset #hopeful","NumberOfLikes":20,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Antisocial Alien on August 14, 2020.

'The Guest List' by Lucy Foley. Oh it's quite intriguing!! I am already a 100 pages down in just 2 hours. Can't wait to finish it. My weekend is definitely Booked!! 😍😍\n.\n.\nThe book is a good mystery but i could pretty much predict the killer once i reached halfway through the book. I loved the way it was written. A unique way of narrative. However I felt the characters were robbed off their chance of revenge and poor Hannah had no closure.

This is the first of more to come and I hope you will join in...Earlier this week I shared a video with friends of my foster kids and I being silly on our bike one rainy afternoon - 3 people wrote back and said how good it was to hear someone laugh. It really, really struck me. I think we are all doing it really tough right now, in our own unique ways. So I want to share what makes me laugh, what makes me feel good, every Friday. Because to have a laugh is to lighten the load for a minute or two. To have a laugh is to re-connect with inner-resilience. To have a laugh is to light up your soul and those around you. So here they are, photos of me being silly on my bike with the kids, not really taken for public consumption, but shared now in the spirit of finding what makes you laugh #FeelGoodFridays #Itshappening #laughteristhebestmedicine #bringbackthegoodtimes #childhood #youth #silly #adulthood #bikeriding #wellbeing #mentalhealth #reachout #sharetheload #stage4 #lockdown2020 #lockdowndiaries #surviving #spreadinglove #spreadhappiness💓 #notyoureverydaycandidate #makingthingshappen @beyondblueofficial @lifelineaustralia @cyc_competitive @yacvic @kingstoncouncil","NumberOfLikes":16,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Jenna Davey-Burns in City of Kingston with @jennadaveyburns.

From the person who used to stay out 14hrs a day on average to the person who haven\u2019t even seen the roads for a month or two straight, not even to get groceries was an interesting turn of events. But I must say I am loving this now. I see a number of people putting out posts on social media about how they hate staying at home and not being able to meet their loved ones, and all fidgety to go back to that NORMAL life we had. I miss my other family consisting two people; girls with whom at least meeting every other fortnight was as necessity as breathing but it\u2019s been almost half a year that I have seen their faces and nothing feels miserable compared to that. I am a barista who hasn\u2019t had a sip of coffee since I volunteered to be on unpaid leave. And what is a barista without coffee eh? I was in a relationship where I felt drained even if it was just for few number of months and I ended up calling it off. I was so afraid to talk about it that deep inside I wished him to vanish rather than confrontation. Because I am never the bearer of bad news but the receiver. I was always at the other end of spectrum. I have cut off ties with people to whom my absence doesn\u2019t mean anything. I have limited my arena to such extent where now I only communicate with people who cares about my wellbeing. Was it that easy? Oh hell no! There were times where I was just gone  because nothing I said to them made me feel understood. I like to steer the wheel of my life hence, I distanced myself from people I love so that I can reach to my own conclusions. My friends always disliked that part of me, but they understood me too. At one point, finally this pandemic crawled under my skin and made me go insane. \n\n#tobecontinued #journaling #writing #writersofinstagram #booklover #tumblr #explore #pandemic #lockdowndiaries #novice #writerslife #thoughtsbecomethings","NumberOfLikes":2,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Oona 🍁 on August 13, 2020.

Popular in herbal culture from Charlemagne, who ordered his people to grow it, to the Pharisees, 2,000 years of Japanese menthol harvesters, to the Romans who brought it with them as they marched through Europe and into Britain.\n\nToday I discovered, most excitingly, that it has an origin story in Greek Mythology (and we all know I love a Greek Myth 🌝). Two stories; the first is that the nymph Minthe was being chatted up by Hades, much to the jealousy of his queen Sephony who turned the nymph into a plant, Mint. The second, that unlucky in love Minthe, was beloved by Pluto, who turned her into a scented herb after his jealous wife took umbrage. Poor gal! \n\nBut she\u2019s now a wonder herb, and menthol has become probably the most ubiquitously used herbal derivative we have in modern times, from toothpastes to chewing gum, \u2018Minty Fresh\u2019 has come to mean clean and healthy. But I feel like that marketing ignores so many fundamental properties that Mint has; a fierce antiseptic, calmative, anti-spasmodic, anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, anti-parasitic, a stimulant. It works to soothe nervous headaches, increases concentration and is known to relieve gastro-intestinal disorders.\n\nSo an all rounder really, I\u2019ll post some options on @_thegreenplace soon! \n\n#mintplant #thegreenplace #lockdowndiaries #londongardens #herbalremedies #brockley","NumberOfLikes":33,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ✨ldc 🌙✨ in Brockley with @lauradrakec, and @_thegreenplace.

That's roughly how long many of us were in lockdown and some are in lockdown again ❤️. Spending a lot of time at home made me feel isolated and bored. So, I ate a lot of sugary things and would have a few drinks every evening, which helped me feel better and cope with the stress. These little habits suddenly became something normal and I also put on weight. I have now reduced my sugar intake and when I crave something I portion it. When I want to have an alcoholic beverage, I look for the alcohol free option. In this way I still have alcohol, but a lot less than before. I now enjoy alcohol free beer and found even an alcohol free gin! I have also started drinking more water, which also helps with my well being.

I have thought about this scene several times since. Grafton street is usually bursting with atmosphere, with musicians, singers, artists, tourists, shoppers and the general hustle and bustle of a capital city. All of them gone now. The ladies that sell the flowers 💐 have also departed. Usually at the top of Grafton street there is a queue of carriage horses waiting to transport tourists around the city, there was only one carriage. Shops have closed, and won\u2019t be reopening.\nI didn\u2019t know whether to post this or not and I had to think about it. I started my insta page as I wanted to post up beat images of simple things in life that get me through and make me happy and also maybe things that I had neglected to appreciate pre corona. I do think that it is important that people remember that ones\u2019 insta page may not be a true representation of the \u2018owner\u2019, it is only a segment of their lives. My aim was to create a page that appreciates the small things and helps me forget about the devastation the corona virus has caused. There are times when I think of how drastically life has changed and life pre corona... One thing I really miss is the soothing embrace of a good auld 🤗 hug (nothing beats that), the craic that was to be had in the pubs and going to a gig and dancing or standing in the audience squeezed in a sea of people. Ah the good old days....... I think we all have to be positive and do our best, we all have good and bad days!!! 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🙏🙏#graftonstreet #graftonstreetbuskers #graftonstreetdublin #dublin #dublinireland #dublinireland🍀 #dublinireland🇮🇪 #coronavirus #coronaviruspandemic #lockdown #lockdown2020 #lockdown2020 #lockdowndiaries #lockdownireland #coronavirusaftermath #effectsofcorona #covid_19 \n#covid19 #livingthroughcovid19 #bepositive #emptystreets","NumberOfLikes":15,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @rebalancinglifesytle in Grafton Street.

After years of living with Fibromyalgia, which is living with pain and fatigue, I had a realisation - for three years I've worked to \u2019get rid of the pain\u2019. When I sat with the pain, I only focused on the hate, blame and judgement and all the things it took away from me. I never welcomed it, I never listened to it and I never respected it.\n.\nCOVID has forced me into new realms of solitude and reflection, as it has for many of us. And through Dreamwork, working with a Cognitive Psychologist and an amazing Pranic Healer (@valentina_healing) - I started accepting,  listening and finally loving my pain, fatigue and Fibromyalgia. \n.\nNot judging negative emotions and making them \u2018bad\u2019 has really helped me as a tactic to frame COVID. \n.\nMy question for you: Have you made COVID or any emotions you maybe feeling \u2018bad, wrong, judged it or saw it or yourself as less than imperfectly perfect?\u2019\n.\nAre you willing to sit with whatever you maybe feeling or COVID as an experience and let go of the judgment or blame and see it through neutral eyes to listen to what message and gift it brings to you? \n.\nJust a thought - looking forward to hearing you\u2019re reflections on emotions 💕\n\n#mindfulness #meditation #mindfulnessmeditation #mindfulnesspractice #meditationpractice #meditations #meditationchallenge #wellbeing #wellbeingwarrior #wellbeingjourney #wellnesscoach #makingthebestofit #lockdown #lockdown2020 #lockdownlife #lockdowndiaries #lightworker #loveyourself #creativity #creative #quotestoliveby #creativewriting #Creativelifehappylife #creativityeveryday #creativitycoach #creativitymatters","NumberOfLikes":27,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Penelope Jane Jones in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia with @valentina_healing.
