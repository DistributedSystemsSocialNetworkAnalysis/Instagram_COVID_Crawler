The hope of seeing better and brighter days. And now when i see life getting back to normal in Pakistan, i'm having mixed emotions. Am happy yet little scared of this virus. I really dont wish to see it bouncing back again. On the contrary, am glad we can go to parks, malls, spas and restaurants, ofcourse with our safety gears but i'm so happy atleast we can. \n-\nIts been 5 good months since the country is in lock down. Our economy has crashed brutally. People have been laid off. Many people went under severe depression, mental health has been screwed up, people have died out of depression, suicide rate has doubled up, small startups and restaurants closed down. i'll be not wrong here if i say we have seen worst of all times in these past 5 months. We never thought of experiencing a pandemic in out life, did we? But we are living in it damn it!Imagine what we have been through!! But now Alhumdulilah ya rab we have survived. The curve has started to flatten. Business and hubs are resuming, public transports are resuming, narkets and shops are opening. I  just hope and pray our economy recovers really soon. \n-\nLet's just hope nobody chokes again. No more losing of loved ones. Let's hope & pray we transition back to normal world real soon.

If you leave the apple slices in the lemon water for longer (like I did by mistake) some of the red comes off the apple peel and turns the apple flesh pink! 🌷\n2. On the end that you start to roll the apple rose, try not to leave any pastry as it will stick out in the middle of the flower. But leave about 1 finger space pastry at the other end of the roll so you can stick it to the side of the rose to complete the flower! \n\nFun fact 🎁\nMother's day was first introduced to Thailand on August 15, 1950. In 1976 it was changed to August 12, to commemorate the birthday of Her Majesty Queen Sirikit, considered the mother of all Thai people.

And then the third wave came and everything is shut. School a week away, but only online. Social distancing in full force, we are back to wondering if life will ever truly get back to normal, we refrain from saying it out loud, but we fear at times it won't and we are all a bit tired of this and we are all dreaming of being somewhere else, at times. we look at each other through a screen and we wave, hello. Are you there? Can you hear me? Connection is not good enough. It's never good enough when you need to talk. And so we are waiting.

This came to mind as yesterday I was turned away from an UWS restaurant 4 blocks from my home. I've learned the hard way to consider safety when traveling, especially in the south. I'll never forget being nearly hate-crimed at a gas stop in West Virginia and didn't think much of my brother bringing a white companion on each of his cross-country road trips for safety. \n\nScotland 2017 was my first time in Europe; EVERY SINGLE person I spoke with about 'traveling while brown' in Europe had a story. \n- The Spanish call Central American travelers \"tercero-mundiales\" (3rd worlders)\n- Greece came up the most in anecdotal negative experiences...\n\nBasically I had low expectations, I've been treated like shit in Manhattan all the time, but low and below in Scotland I had zero experiences of micro-aggressions aka low-key racism, nor scary encounters with armed white men (this has happened to me in upstate NY, WV and Wisconsin). \n\nIt may seem super basic but it was so unusual to be treated kindly everywhere we went that we fell in love with the Scottish highlands. Now that American passports are getting a taste of our own medicine, we will just have to pinterest away until la próxima 😍\n\n#scottishhighlands #scotlandlove #sheepfordays #lockdowndiaries #travelersofcolor #queertravel #queertraveler #honestconversations","NumberOfLikes":79,"Hashtags":["#scottishhighlands","#scotlandlove","#sheepfordays","#lockdowndiaries","#travelersofcolor","#queertravel","#queertraveler","#honestconversations"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by jenny bale 🧸🏳️\u200D🌈 in Scottish Highlands.

Then horror which we used to read in past came in reality for this generation... Pandemic. \nLockdown was imposed in short interval notice and in a snap sound of fingers, many found themselves jobless, trapped inside. Privileged as me just had to get ourselves keep confined to our spaces. Real struggle was for them whose life started daily with sunrise and bread earned by long day hard work. Now there was no work.\nAs a photographers' perspective, shoots got cancelled, project delayed or denied. After a few days of not shooting, we started searching way to pursue passion. Business meetings started on conference video calls. Few photographers came with a temporary solution of shooting on video calls. Facetime shoots, WhatsApp Call shoots, Google video shoots, Skype shoot came in existence... in a shell, Virtual Shoots. Ofcourse not good as actual shoot, but \"...dil ko khush rakhne ko ghalib ye khayal achchha hai...\", it became a trend amongst photographers.\nAfter initial denial, me too thought to give it a try. Talked to few people connected with me. Now I am sharing few results. \nI won't call myself as Photographer for these shots, just a director. \n--- \u2022\u2022\u2022 ---\nIn picture: @dikshadesire\n--- \u2022\u2022\u2022 ---\n#virtual #shoot #virtualshoot #facetime #facetimephotoshoot #whatsapp #videocall #portrait_vision #pictureoftheday #photooftheday #pursuitofportraits #portrait_today #portrait_mood #portraitphotography #portrait_shots #portraiture #mood #moodygrams #snapseed #lockdowndiaries #lockdown #coronatime #portraitvision_ #pr0ject_uno #pr0ject_soul #portraitphotographer #windowseatproject #windowgazing #sunlight #model","NumberOfLikes":66,"Hashtags":["#virtual","#shoot","#virtualshoot","#facetime","#facetimephotoshoot","#whatsapp","#videocall","#portrait_vision","#pictureoftheday","#photooftheday","#pursuitofportraits","#portrait_today","#portrait_mood","#portraitphotography","#portrait_shots","#portraiture","#mood","#moodygrams","#snapseed","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdown","#coronatime","#portraitvision_","#pr0ject_uno","#pr0ject_soul","#portraitphotographer","#windowseatproject","#windowgazing","#sunlight","#model"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1596988007,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 09 17:46:47 CEST 2020","Location":"India"},{"Owner":"suneeth_nagam","CaptionText":"Smile on my face doesn't mean I'm Happy 😊😒\n#royalenfield #love #beast #newpost #bike #casuallook #smile #happy #roadsterlife #royalenfieldindia #royalenfieldbullet #modelpose #modellife #modelposes #fashionphotography #newconcept #manipulation #editingworld #editingtrends #editz #editingzone #editingclub09 #snapseededit #snapseed #picsart #picsartedit #editingbase #editings #lockdownlife #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":167,"Hashtags":["#royalenfield","#love","#beast","#newpost","#bike","#casuallook","#smile","#happy","#roadsterlife","#royalenfieldindia","#royalenfieldbullet","#modelpose","#modellife","#modelposes","#fashionphotography","#newconcept","#manipulation","#editingworld","#editingtrends","#editz","#editingzone","#editingclub09","#snapseededit","#snapseed","#picsart","#picsartedit","#editingbase","#editings","#lockdownlife","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Suneeth on August 09, 2020.

The color separation is good though, the off white and black really blends well with the dark green and light green as well as the grey for the Panzer CAS.

This phase will not last forever, soon we will become the country full of old and frail mouths to feed. On the other side, the wave of nationalism and pressure of reviving Indic civilization demands a movement that demands years of struggle, sacrifice and correct attitude. It's a junction where we have to choose or balance between these two paths. Denial is not a solution, Anger and hostility is not a solution. At the end of this churning we will emerge stronger, united and more capable of leading the world. But, are we ready? Are we seeing the big picture?

And I don't know about you, but I'm in need of just a touch of lightheartedness today. So whulst thisnwould be a great #traxtraveltuesday ,here's a #Fridayflashback to the time I went #Sharkcagediving \n.\n\nMy kids have been in my photo albums everyday for the longest time now, and I myself have been feeling the deep urges that nudge me towards travel. Maybe its the extreme case of cabin fever thats got my old #explorationbugs on hyper. But we're all feeling it. And I was asking hubby why he thinks my urges to travel &explore are on overdrive right now when I logically know its not possible, when he articulated it so clearly: \"We're all looking for some sort of soul food right. And that is one of your greatest sources of joy\"\n.\nWith all thats been going on in the world, a vacuum has formed, and we naturally know to its the small things, different for 3ach of us, to feed our soul.Something that deeply feeds our spark for life, soemthing that fires us up and makes us feel alive...so that not only can we better traverse the stormy waters we constantly find ourselves in right now, but to pump back our light and good energy into this world. \n\"Because what the world needs is more people who have come alive\" \u2013 Howard Thurman.\n.\nAnd I'll  tell ya, swimming in the ocean, face to face with a bunch of #GreatWhiteSharks really does make you feel VERY MUCH ALIVE!I love exploring this world, including our local wares, because, dannng, our country is STUNNING! It's one of the things that light my fires. And definitely one I'm sorely missing. So for now I turn to other outlets, and other fires that dwell within me...waiting patiently for a time we can do more again. (Swipe to see one of these beauties we swam with)\n.\nSo what fires you up? What stirs and fills your soul? May we all have a fulfilling weekend ahead❤\n.\nPs.

Supernatural events keep happening until two priests join forces to defeat evil forces.\n\nThis series deserved way more recognition than it did. It is one of the best tv shows in the horror genre I have ever watched. There were a lot of typical scare tactics, but was nicely riddled with fresh original scenes which was a pleasant surprise. A must watch for all the Exorcism Fans.

It is the belief that each of us is more likely to experience good outcomes and less likely to experience bad outcomes.\nThe key to optimism bias is that we disregard the reality of an overall situation, because we think we are excluded from the potential negative effects.\nIt's just a psychological trap, nothing else.\n:\nRemember a quote from Joseph Stalin, \nA million deaths is a statistic, But one death is a tragedy.\n:\nIt's like if we read the news that 10,000 people died, it doesn't affect us that way, as a single death of someone we know, does. Because when it's a single death, we get to attach the name, story and narrative of that person and feel emotional about it, but a million deaths is indifferent to our psyche. This is another psychological trap.\n:\nSo, the bottom-line is, that no matter how social norms are being relaxed, stay alert, cautious and extra vigilant, as if it's still an EMERGENCY,\nbecause it still is...!!! \nStay safe and go outside only if it is must. \nFollow all the precautions without fail.\nTake extreme Care.\nGood Day! \nWhatsApp forward from one of my friends! \n.\n#staysafeeveryone #stayhealthy #staystrong #wearthedamnmask #gocoronago #coronabedamned #weareinthistogether #wewillgetthroughthis #maskindia #wearamask😷 #lockdowndiaries #lockdown2020 #bevigilant #besafe #besafeeveryone #socialdistancing #socialdistancing2020 #besociallyresponsible #besociallysmart #besociallydriven #besociallyaware","NumberOfLikes":40,"Hashtags":["#staysafeeveryone","#stayhealthy","#staystrong","#wearthedamnmask","#gocoronago","#coronabedamned","#weareinthistogether","#wewillgetthroughthis","#maskindia","#wearamask😷","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdown2020","#bevigilant","#besafe","#besafeeveryone","#socialdistancing","#socialdistancing2020","#besociallyresponsible","#besociallysmart","#besociallydriven","#besociallyaware"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ˙·٠\u2022●♥️ Merlyn Kurian ♥️●\u2022٠·˙💋 in Socially Responsible.","NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1596785395,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 07 09:29:55 CEST 2020","Location":"Socially Responsible"},{"Owner":"river_phoenix_dog_page","CaptionText":"Our breakfast this morning - dice raw beef, leftover pasta, leftover roast pork gravy and a sprinkle of frozen baby peas #mumsdayoff #englishbullterrier #puppy #bullterrieraustralia #dogofinstaworld #bullterrierworld #bullterrierlovers #bullterrierpics #bullterrierpuppy #bullypuppies #riverphoenix #throwback #myspiritanimal #dogstagram #ilovemybullterrier #instadog #instapuppy #dogmum #covid19 #wfh #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":57,"Hashtags":["#mumsdayoff","#englishbullterrier","#puppy","#bullterrieraustralia","#dogofinstaworld","#bullterrierworld","#bullterrierlovers","#bullterrierpics","#bullterrierpuppy","#bullypuppies","#riverphoenix","#throwback","#myspiritanimal","#dogstagram","#ilovemybullterrier","#instadog","#instapuppy","#dogmum","#covid19","#wfh","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":13,"Timestamp":1596785037,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 07 09:23:57 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"pritysingh371","CaptionText":"Ass+u+me 🌈 #mysteriousgirl \n#lockdowndiaries #varanasi \n#selfieera","NumberOfLikes":174,"Hashtags":["#mysteriousgirl","#lockdowndiaries","#varanasi","#selfieera"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Mysterious Girl in Varanasi - Banaras - Kashi.
