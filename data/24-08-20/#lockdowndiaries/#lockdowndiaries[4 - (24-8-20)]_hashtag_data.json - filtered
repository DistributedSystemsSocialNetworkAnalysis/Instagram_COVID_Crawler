I\u2019m troubled by the state of our society, by the pandemic and the lockdowns, thousands of jobs in my city gone, the loss of life in Lebanon, the news that a lovely woman I know has cancer, and a beautiful family that I follow on here have lost their home. There\u2019s so much heaviness, and we are all physically isolated from one another. We weren\u2019t meant to live this way. \n.\nWhen I\u2019m struggling with life I try to take a few moments to sit out on our back steps by myself with a coffee. It\u2019s so good to get some fresh air, and getting out of my house gives me a new perspective, literally and figuratively.  A little time for self-care and our family rosary really help too. \n.\nThe longer this lockdown goes on, the more I see the importance of a strong daily rhythm. When life is confusing and uncertain, it is good to get up and do our daily work, to keep our hands busy. Unable to move freely, I am drawing inspiration from the monastic life, from those cloistered religious who choose to remain in one place, and must live an ordered day within their walls with contentment and love. \n.\nFor the first time in my life I am consistently getting up early. I have surprised myself by enjoying it, and I\u2019m craving even earlier starts. For a confirmed night owl, this could only have been a grace given to me by God. \n.\nI managed to make another contribution towards my #everybitcountschallenge again and made these Vinegared Red Onions from the Ball Preserving Blue Book. I have eight jars to add to my pantry. I have no idea what these will taste like, but isn\u2019t the colour pretty? I didn\u2019t actually grow the onions myself, but if I had, this is where I\u2019d have grown them. 😉","NumberOfLikes":169,"Hashtags":["#everybitcountschallenge"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":24,"Timestamp":1596712770,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 06 13:19:30 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Treated myself to some comfy slips!

I don\u2019t trust supermarket fish, so I bought salmon and tuna sashimi from sushi store. I used the same marination indicated in the recipe for both fish, they turned out so yummy!! 🤤\n2. Poké is a very versatile dish, especially with the toppings and dressings. I used wasabi mayo and roasted sesame for the dressing, and seaweed salad, prawns, kimchi, avocado, carrot, cucumber, edamame, and pineapple as toppings. 🥗\n\nTips and Tricks 🧑\u200D🍳\nWhen assembling the dish, I poured roasted sesame dressing right on top of the brown rice to give it more flavor, then wasabi mayo dressing on top of the toppings. \n\nFun fact🎁 \nPoké was invented by native Hawaiians and made with small reef fish. With the arrival of Japanese workers in late 1800s, they brought Japanese influence on the dish, i.e. the use of ahi tuna and soy sauce. Using salmon in Poké bowl is seen as inauthentic, as well as pineapple (oops).\n\n#pokebowl #pokébowl #poké\n#sweetteaandthyme #lunchrecipe #lunchideas #easyrecipes #3rookiecooks #cooksgonnacook  #melbournefoodie  #foodporn #foodies #fortheloveoffood #foodgasm #foodgram #madewithlove #homemade #homemadefood #homemadewithlove #recipes  #easyrecipes #cookeatrepeat #cuisine_captures #cuisineart #quaranteam #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":431,"Hashtags":["#rookiescooktheworld","#pokebowl","#pokébowl","#poké","#sweetteaandthyme","#lunchrecipe","#lunchideas","#easyrecipes","#3rookiecooks","#cooksgonnacook","#melbournefoodie","#foodporn","#foodies","#fortheloveoffood","#foodgasm","#foodgram","#madewithlove","#homemade","#homemadefood","#homemadewithlove","#recipes","#easyrecipes","#cookeatrepeat","#cuisine_captures","#cuisineart","#quaranteam","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":34,"Timestamp":1596711307,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 06 12:55:07 CEST 2020","Location":"Hawaii, United States"},{"CaptionText":"#lockdowndiaries #day133  visiting ouma with #freesias and #irises #capetownwinter","NumberOfLikes":27,"Hashtags":["#lockdowndiaries","#day133","#freesias","#irises","#capetownwinter"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Roberta Fox on August 06, 2020.

After distributing the gifts, she asked, 'Mummy! When can we do this again?' Ever since, we celebrate festivals at the orphanage\u2013you can\u2019t put a price to their smiles. \nSo one day, during the lockdown, I saw a sweeper limping, yet doing his duty. I immediately gave him food, a mask & a sanitizer. His eyes lit up & he said, 'Thank you!' They were just 2 words, but I felt his gratitude & realised how little our essential workers have. \nSo I ordered sanitization kits & collaborated with a kitchen service to distribute them amongst essential workers, police & sweepers. My husband was worried about my safety, but I followed protocol. \nA week later, my son Shrey said, 'Ma, wait! I'm coming with you\u2019, & Meghna joined too. We went from Juhu to Marine Drive, distributing essentials amongst 400 workers.\nWe've been doing this for 2 months every weekend & the response has been heartwarming. A cop even asked Meghna for a selfie to show his kid! We even give free health check-ups to the elderly in our society. \nIt began last month, when my father-in-law had a low sugar episode. That\u2019s when Meghna said, 'Shouldn't we do something for the senior citizens too?' She\u2019s a doctor, so she attends to the elderly, while I arrange for their food & medicines. They live alone & they're scared\u2013we\u2019re just trying to make them feel less alone. \nLike one of the aunties had breast pain & feared it was cancer, until my daughter did a physical examination & calmed her down. \nBut that day when Meghna came home, I couldn\u2019t help but hug her. I'm so proud of the woman she's become. And Shrey too\u2013he's just 14, but he used all his birthday funds to buy essentials for 150 workers.\nWhen I began trying to make a difference 15 years ago, I barely had the resources. But now, with our NGO Meghashrey, we can do much more. \nI\u2019ve realised that if you really want to help, it takes one step. I started with funding my driver\u2019s son\u2019s education\u2013today he\u2019s a CA looking after his family. So that\u2019s what it\u2019s about\u2013taking that one step to help & you never know how that one step could change a person\u2019s life forever.\u201D","NumberOfLikes":35254,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":142,"Timestamp":1596630205,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 05 14:23:25 CEST 2020","Location":"Mumbai, Maharashtra"},{"CaptionText":"#Scenery #copied\n#natureartgallery\n#natureartwork \n#seashores\n#brustroa5notebook\n#brustropencilarts \n#involutedesign \n#artwork \n#lockdownart \n#quarantinelife \n#lockdowndiaries \n#artzoneforu #igdaily #igartwork #igart  #artoftheday #indianpromotionhouse","NumberOfLikes":24,"Hashtags":["#Scenery","#copied","#natureartgallery","#natureartwork","#seashores","#brustroa5notebook","#brustropencilarts","#involutedesign","#artwork","#lockdownart","#quarantinelife","#lockdowndiaries","#artzoneforu","#igdaily","#igartwork","#igart","#artoftheday","#indianpromotionhouse"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by vidu_artzone in Chitrakoot : A Cultural Heritage with @_artist_booth, @bindass_art, @brustro_official, @_._artistica_._, @art_revelations_india, @art.sharing101, and @artistcommunityindia.

It is ultimately my favorite movie. James Cameron brought us a dream with this movie. I can believe that it broke box office records as the best block buster movie of the decade. This also explains why it took a decade for another movie (Avengers End Game) to break its record. This movie is a great adventure film set in Pandora a fifth moon inhabited by the Na\u2019vi. There a paraplegic Jake replaces his twin brother on a mission, he then however doesn\u2019t do what he was sent to do. The reason for his change of heart is the fact that he fell in love with the Na\u2019vi particularly Neytiri a kind of princes of the Na\u2019va. Therefore this movie is a great adventure story but also kind of a love story. The CGI and use of 3D in the movie is out of this world. Five stars is not enough. As I said in the beginning, I cannot stop watching the movie in fact I started watching it since its premiere and I still love it.\n.\n#maractivities #mar #makaut  #maractivities  #quarantinelife #creditpoint #creditpoint  #maractivitiesduringlockdown #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":2,"Hashtags":["#maractivities","#mar","#makaut","#maractivities","#quarantinelife","#creditpoint","#creditpoint","#maractivitiesduringlockdown","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Sweta on August 04, 2020.

He spoke about toxic productivity, something many of us have struggled with but perhaps without realising it. We have seen key workers and their tireless commitment to public service. We have seen people make the most of staying at home by learning new skills, starting exercise routines or volunteering in the neighbourhood. We naturally compare ourselves to each other and if we feel like we're not being as productive as we could or should be, this can have a negative effect on our wellbeing.\n.\nLike thousands of others, Alex has been on furlough. Even though he has struggled during this time, he has found happiness knowing that he is loved by God and can be used by God. Adapting Jesus' famous Beatitudes from the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5), Alex summarises: \u201CBlessed are the furloughed for they will find fulfilment, purpose and their identity in God.\u201D Alex's testimony is available to watch now on IGTV.\n.\nIf you'd like to learn more about faith and what it means to be a Christian, send us a message.

Go for flats on your feet to stay comfortable throughout the day. \n\nHowever if you wanna set aside your indian wear, you always have the option of palazzos and a cute croptop. To make it into an indo-western look add chandbalis, a kada and a matching ring to complete your look.

We were supposed to collect 2 Saturday from Crawley and then another 2 Sunday from Stoke, but when we got to the first place, the seller said they had 3 babies that hadn\u2019t been collected that needed homes and did we want them, so of course we did! It meant we had an established brood of hens who already got on, and we didn\u2019t have to travel to stoke the next day either!\nI\u2019m letting them settle in properly and trying not to disturb them too much just yet, but when I can, I\u2019ll take some photos of them individually and you can have a proper good look at each one!\nThank you to everyone for the naming suggestions, they were so cute! We have chosen to call them:\nMargot (after Margot Robbie)\nRuby (after Ruby Rose)\nPippa (after Joe\u2019s family dog)\nFearne (after Fearne Cotton)\nHolly (after Holly Willoughby)\n🐣🖤\nI think the older two are 7-8 weeks and the younger ones maybe 6 weeks old?

First time I ever wore a mask😷. I am not against wearing a mask and Please keep in mind that I live in The Netherlands where the covid situation was not like other countries so the restrictions were different for us. Wearing surgical mask doesn\u2019t prevent you from getting virus.! Social distancing is the most important.! It is for your own safety but I want to write about this with medicine expertise around me. But that\u2019s for another day 😊\n.\n.\nAnyways, Few weeks ago, I went to Lille, France. It\u2019s approximately 2,5 hours by car. It was our first day trip after the lockdown. We have been to Lille many times before but this time, it was different. It was too crowded. It\u2019s always busy on Saturdays but this weekend was something different.\n.\n.\nI thought France was hit bad by covid19 so people will be more cautious. I thought people will keep social distance like people in The Netherlands. I was expecting people in malls like here and people are more cautious by themselves. This was not the case in France. People were even not remaining distance in queue. So we didn\u2019t go to any store. I wanted to look for some clothes for my son but the situation was quite worse there 🙂.\n.\n.\nSo the face mask was compulsory in the stores and restaurants. We wanted to go to a restaurant but couldn\u2019t because of no masks. We were never obliged to wear a mask in The Netherlands because there was never a strict lockdown here like other countries. The masks are only compulsory in the public transport which we don\u2019t use these days.\n.\n.\nWhen the situation was worse here, we didn\u2019t go out at all, my husband went to grocery store or we got home delivery for everything we needed. But the things got better soon. I only went to my garden and that was my outing 😊 but better to be safe than sorry. Things got better here and there is still no obligation of wearing masks in stores, restaurants or malls (the situation will be changing soon though). People are careful by themselves. So back to mask, my first mask was in France and this is the picture of my first mask which we bought from a pharmacy.\n.\n.\nDo you have a mask story? Tell me in comments 😊\n.\n.\n#masks #maskstory","NumberOfLikes":24,"Hashtags":["#masks","#maskstory"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Fatima I. 👑 in Netherlands.","NumberOfComments":9,"Timestamp":1596402446,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 02 23:07:26 CEST 2020","Location":"Netherlands"},{"CaptionText":"I had something personal to do in Clanwilliam, so I ended up being there for some time. In my mind , it was always that place somewhere on the N7, far away from everything and one of those places you just drive past (That saying don't judge a book by its cover, definitely applies over here)\n\nI love rooibos tea so so much and Clanwilliam is known for being the heartland of Rooibos because it is planted and cultivated in the small and intimate town. This means there are quite a couple of tea houses. Each tea house was quite cute and I got to try lots of different flavors. Also, homemade rooibos tea is amazing😍\n\nIt's also just over a 2 hour drive from Cape Town. So picture roadtrips with your circle and padkos😂, postlockdown of course. If it was a social visit , I would have loved to do some hiking and chill by the dam some more but like they say, there is always a next time. This is just a little peek of what I was able to experience, let me know what you think of the town ❤?\n\n#livethehilife \n@hi_online_\n@siebritztwins \n@freshbycaddy\n\n#thisisouthafrica #travellifediary #clanwilliam #citrusdal #cederberg #rooibostea #westerncape #southafricaza #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":84,"Hashtags":["#livethehilife","#thisisouthafrica","#travellifediary","#clanwilliam","#citrusdal","#cederberg","#rooibostea","#westerncape","#southafricaza","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":8,"Timestamp":1596306035,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 01 20:20:35 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"TOO SWEET😋WHO'S TRYING THIS???\n.\n.\n.\n.\n👉FOR ADVERTS AND PROMOTION SEND A DM \/CHAT US VIA LINK IN THE BIO\n.\n.\n.\n.\nCredit : @1qfoodplatter\n.\n.\n.\n.\nFollow us @foodblogafrica for more delicious Nigerian \/African Recipes 👌\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#foodblogafricang\n#foodblogafrica247\n\n#nigerianfood #nigeriansoup#okrosoup #okro#foodinspiration#ka3na#ka3nabbnaija#lilobbnaija#ericbbnaija#praisebbnaija#bbnaijaupdate#bigbrother20#bigbrother2020#lockdowndiaries#ericabbnaija#nengibbnaija#nengiofficial#ozo#ozobbnaija#wathoni#tolanibaj#kiddwaya#laycon#layconbbnaija#foodmarketing","NumberOfLikes":323,"Hashtags":["#foodblogafricang","#foodblogafrica247","#nigerianfood","#nigeriansou","#okrosoup","#okr","#foodinspiratio","#ka3n","#ka3nabbnaij","#lilobbnaij","#ericbbnaij","#praisebbnaij","#bbnaijaupdat","#bigbrother2","#bigbrother202","#lockdowndiarie","#ericabbnaij","#nengibbnaij","#nengiofficia","#oz","#ozobbnaij","#wathon","#tolaniba","#kiddway","#layco","#layconbbnaij","#foodmarketing"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":7,"Timestamp":1596398164,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 02 21:56:04 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Here are the 9 housemates with the least votes in the Bbnaija show.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#vee #lilo #ka3na #praise #eric #trikytee #tolanibaj #bbnaijaupdate #bbnlockdown #bbnaijalockdown2020 #bbnlockdown #bbnaijaseason5 #bbnaija5 #bbnhousemates #laycon #brighto #gistloverblog #gistdey247 #naijaweddings #realityshow #lockdowndiaries #lagosians #ozoemena #erica #kiddrica #kiddwaya","NumberOfLikes":3,"Hashtags":["#vee","#lilo","#ka3na","#praise","#eric","#trikytee","#tolanibaj","#bbnaijaupdate","#bbnlockdown","#bbnaijalockdown2020","#bbnlockdown","#bbnaijaseason5","#bbnaija5","#bbnhousemates","#laycon","#brighto","#gistloverblog","#gistdey247","#naijaweddings","#realityshow","#lockdowndiaries","#lagosians","#ozoemena","#erica","#kiddrica","#kiddwaya"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by GOSSIP CENTRE on August 02, 2020.

I know some people will have found furlough to be like a long holiday but for me it's been a long stretch of time to spend with all the stresses that work distracts me from, on top of shielding and the general fear of the outside and the thoughts of \"will I even have a job at the end of this?\". I had a phone call with work yesterday morning and gained a small amount of clarity on where I stand for moving forward, it wasn't the worst news to be honest but I'd been waiting to find out for so long that finally hearing it all just left me emotionally and physically exhausted. \nI ended up just having to go to bed, which is something I've never done before. \nI knew I just had to listen to what my brain and body were trying to tell me and they were saying \"I want to rest\" loud and clear.\nIve woke up this morning feeling much better, more clear and more calm.

Maybe a few slower days will have me back to 'normal'.\nI guess what I'm trying to say is remember to put the brakes on every now and then before your body forces you to.

Even the Eid messages were full of \"keep safe\" and memes of sheep wearing masks. \n\nWe've been in lockdown for 4.5 months now. And yesterday was another reminder of the weird times we're living in. I think for many people the idea of not spending it with their loved ones was just too painful to skip. We caught up with family through video calls and chats but I acknowledge that it's not the same.\n\nI'm hoping that we get some normality back next year whether it's celebrating Eid, Christmas or Diwali. I know it's tough to be away from your loved ones, especially when you're craving human interaction, but if they didn't visit you, know that they're doing what they can to keep themselves and others safe, and isn't that an act of love too?\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#lockdownthoughts #lockdowneid #motivationalthoughts #sidehustles #beinspired #staypositive #eidmemes #lifeskills #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":61,"Hashtags":["#lockdownthoughts","#lockdowneid","#motivationalthoughts","#sidehustles","#beinspired","#staypositive","#eidmemes","#lifeskills","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1596359863,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 02 11:17:43 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Gift for all my friends...miss u school buddies...\n#friendshipday❤️ \n.\n.\nFollow on IG\/FB for more @the_empty_wordsmith \n.\n.\nLike💝  Comment💌| Share💫| Tag 📌\n.\n.\n.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n.\n.\n#friendshipdayspecial\n#friendshipdayquotes\n#friendshipdaygifts #yourquoteandmine \n#yourquote #yourquotes\n#nojoto #nojotoofficial\n#covid_19 #coronavirus \n#lockdown #instadaily\n#lockdowndiaries \n#writersofinstagram \n#writerscommunity \n#writersofig \n#iwrite #writers\n#the_indian_writers11 \n#rahatindori \n#mirzaghalib \n#gulzar \n#gulzarsahab \n#instagram \n#team_of_poet05\n#pod\n#yourdreamnetwork","NumberOfLikes":37,"Hashtags":["#friendshipday❤️","#friendshipdayspecial","#friendshipdayquotes","#friendshipdaygifts","#yourquoteandmine","#yourquote","#yourquotes","#nojoto","#nojotoofficial","#covid_19","#coronavirus","#lockdown","#instadaily","#lockdowndiaries","#writersofinstagram","#writerscommunity","#writersofig","#iwrite","#writers","#the_indian_writers11","#rahatindori","#mirzaghalib","#gulzar","#gulzarsahab","#instagram","#team_of_poet05","#pod","#yourdreamnetwork"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by @the_empty_wordsmith on August 02, 2020 tagging @the_empty_wordsmith.
