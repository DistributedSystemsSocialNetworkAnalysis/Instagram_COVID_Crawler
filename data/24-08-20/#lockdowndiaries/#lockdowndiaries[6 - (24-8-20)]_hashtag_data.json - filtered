I do! But luckily I haven\u2019t had to spend over £600 each month & 4 hours each day travelling. Thanks lockdown! \nBut it turns out I\u2019m a fair chunk down. So, what happened?\n.\nThe extra time at home 🏡 has meant Ive had more energy to focus on me, my brand & my dreams. And Ive had the opportunity to invest in myself & my future! Yes it has been quite a chunk of money with no return right now\u2026\n.\nBut it has seriously been one of THE BEST THINGS I have done!!🎉\n.\nThe thoughts of spending that much money on me was terrifying. It really scared me. But oh my god has it been worth it. To actually take the time & just think about what I want & need to reach my goals, & making those first steps towards it is really, really empowering.\n.\nIm always that person who will give all their time to help & support others, share advice - I always will do - but I seriously beat myself up & tear myself down. I can never take my own advice or think about what I want - something that I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not alone in feeling.\n.\nBut the coaching programs I have invested in are giving me not just the tools & knowledge but the confidence & belief that I can achieve my dreams. Thanks again Prasha and Holly. And I am in the mindset that the physical items I have been able to buy are not just things, but an investment in my future.\n.\nI recognise that Im in a very privileged position to be able to do this, especially during lockdown, and invest financially. But I would strongly encourage every single one of you to invest in yourself before the year is out - financially or with your time! These investments also don\u2019t need to be business related. Think careers, relationships, health & more.\n.\nHere are some ways that you could do that:\n🎇 Explore professional development at work\n🎇Pair up & swap skills with someone. Teach each other!\n🎇 Sign up to a course\n🎇 Invest in your health & meditate, journal or walk daily\n🎇 Find free resources online to support you\n🎇 Catch up with an old friend\n🎇 Get an accountability buddy or a mentor\n.\nHow are you going to invest in yourself before 2020 is done?\n👇🏼👇🏼","NumberOfLikes":275,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Dr Soph🌻|Science communication in Cambridge, Cambridgeshire with @prashadutra, @thestemsquad, @scientistselfies, @herstemstory, @thescicommunity, @women.doing.science, and @women.transforming.science.

My goal was essentially to make it through lockdown whilst maintaining my weight and trying to keep up with my fitness. To monitor that, the day that the gyms closed (21.03.2020) I weighed, measured & took photos of myself for comparison at a later date. As we all know the gyms reopened on Saturday (25.07.2020) and so I redid my weight, measurements & photos. Over the course of lockdown I\u2019ve gained 8lb and increased by body fat % as a lot of muscle has been lost, especially around my stomach and thighs as can be seen in the photos. I\u2019ve redone 2x LivFit workouts and my times have slowed by 1:30-2:00 mins which means my fitness levels have dropped somewhat but not completely off the scale - and probably expected after having not used things like a rower in 16 weeks. \n\nI thought a lot about it over the weekend and even though I\u2019ve gained weight I\u2019m actually OK with it - this has probably been the first proper test for my \u201Clifestyle change\u201D since I really began this whole journey in early 2018. I was worried I\u2019d begin to sink back into larger portions, less nutritious food and sacking off the workouts because there was no one to keep me accountable. In truth I was up and down with it. \nEarly on I was put on furlough and in all honesty I felt a little lost and lacking purpose and struggled. I then found a new routine and began house projects and a renewed sense of purpose so I felt great, was on plan & developed a great routine. After a while I was asked to go back to working from home full time and again I felt a little lost and out of sync and struggled to re-build the routine which has resulted in the gain. Now I\u2019m back in a stable working pattern and have access to the gym again I feel much more positive and a sense of normality is setting back in.... cont in comments...","NumberOfLikes":45,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1595848486,"LocalDate":"Mon Jul 27 13:14:46 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"my_mia_x","CaptionText":"💜 We\u2019ve gone a bit girly - Lockdown has meant most of her outfits just don\u2019t get worn or seen, I didn\u2019t have many nice outfits in 0-3 and she\u2019s slowly growing into her 3-6 bits so we can start getting use out of her lovely bits.

So here we go. #unfiltered on a Sunday morning. This never ending lockdown has brought out different things in different people. Some have turned avid home gardeners, some have tuned into the master chef in them.. and so on.. for me it has brought out the \u201CMonica\u201D in me. I seem to have developed an obsession for cleaning my house, especially the kitchen. In fact, A was heard complaining to the child how her mother is changing things in the kitchen  every day. It\u2019s true though.. one day I de clutter and throw things out, next day I order more stuff from amazon.. I have wiped every cabinet, every surface in the kitchen several times in the last four days. I cannot rest peacefully until my sink is absolutely clean. And in fact the satisfaction I am getting out of a clean sink is like none other these days.  And it\u2019s not because of fear of infection.. maybe because with so much happening outside that I cannot control, this gives me a sense of control.

I began following @abhishekhanna and seeing his stellar work, and I thought to myself - maybe I can give this a try! ⠀\n⠀\nAnd fortuitously enough - my mom made this sumptuous curry for the day. I shellebrated, because I knew then and there that this would be an Ande Funday. (I'll stop with the bad yolks now, hope they made you crack up xD) My mom had sourced the ripest, reddest tomatoes and I was dying to use them in a shoot. So I grabbed a few from the kitchen, along with some other accoutrements - lemons, garlic, coriander, and some chillies! We also had two chopping boards neatly stacked in the bottom shelf, which I planned to use as the base.⠀\n⠀\nI then proceeded to MasterChef the hell out of that curry - sprinkling the leaves, arranging the accompaniments around the centerpiece in the most decorative manner possible. And finally, I turned on my camera! These are some of my favorite shots from the day :))⠀\n⠀\nI've never really spent much time in the kitchen, besides helping myself to an extra serving of that delish payasam. I spend more time at the dinner table, refining my Michelin Man look. As the popular old saying goes - The best way to a man's heart is through his stomach!⠀\n⠀\nI've been super lazy, forgive me. But I promise I'll get back on track and give you a glimpse into my lockdown journey over the course of the next few weeks!⠀\n⠀\nP.S.: One last thing - Hope this photo was worth the white :P⠀\n⠀\nShot on Fujifilm XA-5 with 15-45 mm ⠀\n⠀\n#foodporn #foodphotography #foodiesofinstagram #hautecuisines #foodgasm #feedfeed #huffposttaste #droolclub #artofvisuals #photooftheday #photographers_of_india #fstoppers #nkpofficial #bangalorephotographer @artofvisuals #akhanna #shotonfujifilm #nustaharamkhor #coloursofindia #lockdowndiaries #flatlay #colorphotography #lightroom #myspc #insidephotos @natgeotravellerindia @bbc_travel #natgeoyourshot #cntgiveitashot #lonelyplanetindia #foodstagram #instayum #f52grams","NumberOfLikes":181,"Hashtags":["#foodporn","#foodphotography","#foodiesofinstagram","#hautecuisines","#foodgasm","#feedfeed","#huffposttaste","#droolclub","#artofvisuals","#photooftheday","#photographers_of_india","#fstoppers","#nkpofficial","#bangalorephotographer","#akhanna","#shotonfujifilm","#nustaharamkhor","#coloursofindia","#lockdowndiaries","#flatlay","#colorphotography","#lightroom","#myspc","#insidephotos","#natgeoyourshot","#cntgiveitashot","#lonelyplanetindia","#foodstagram","#instayum","#f52grams"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":26,"Timestamp":1595767390,"LocalDate":"Sun Jul 26 14:43:10 CEST 2020","Location":"Egg-Land"},{"Owner":"petra_sittig","CaptionText":"A moment in Lockdown with Baritone, Andrés Alzate Gaviria and Mezzo-Soprano Andrea Seemayer #momentsinlockdown @andrea.seemayer #mezzosoprano #operasinger #baritone #singersspotlight #operasingersofinstagram #lockdownvienna #lockdowndiaries #alleswirdgut #theresalwaysaway #musicmakestheworldgoround #vienna_austria #kopfhoch #viennamusicians #windowsup #weareallinthistogether #couplesinlockdown #viennaartist #positiveminds #gehmachdeifensterlauf #yourplaceisalwaysherewithus #musiciansunite #habsonneimherzen 🍀🔒","NumberOfLikes":55,"Hashtags":["#momentsinlockdown","#mezzosoprano","#operasinger","#baritone","#singersspotlight","#operasingersofinstagram","#lockdownvienna","#lockdowndiaries","#alleswirdgut","#theresalwaysaway","#musicmakestheworldgoround","#vienna_austria","#kopfhoch","#viennamusicians","#windowsup","#weareallinthistogether","#couplesinlockdown","#viennaartist","#positiveminds","#gehmachdeifensterlauf","#yourplaceisalwaysherewithus","#musiciansunite","#habsonneimherzen"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Petra Sittig Photography in Vienna, Austria with @andrea.seemayer.

Madhavrao Peshwa built this fort on the borders of the empire and handed over the control of the fort to Patwardhan family of Sangli who later transferred it to Mudholkar Ghorpade. A trench has been built surrounding the fort and is now covered with vegetation. A part of the trench opposite the entrance has been filled to make a road in-way. The two bastions alongside the entrance have been refurbished. The fort has two fortification walls. The outer wall has 18 bastions while the inner one has 8 bastions. The 12 ft base of fortified walls and bastions are built of black rock and the upper remaining part is made of bricks. As we enter the citadel from the inner fortified wall there is a dense vegetation cover and many structural remains have been hidden in here. There is step well. Further to the well in the outer fortified wall there is a secret doorway.\n\n@aniketkhedekar_ @shodhashodh @girlonthemountains @rupali_kamtekar @virajt_dd11 @jayedeepjagtap1 and Me 😉","NumberOfLikes":61,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1595748105,"LocalDate":"Sun Jul 26 09:21:45 CEST 2020","Location":"Bahadur Wadi"},{"Owner":"mahu2407","CaptionText":"Cheesy Potato Cups🧀🥔☕😍🤤🥤\nFrom the basic ingredients that we all have in our homes, this is the easiest baking dish!

Here's her 'lockdown' story:\n\nMy baby and I sitting in the balcony watching the sunset along the horizons of the Periyar river where boats paddle across its streams, is our usual evening. In the initial days of the lockdown, I was hopeful that everything will soon get back to normal. But my hopes were crushed by mid-April when Covid cases in India started spiking. \nMy husband - a navigational officer, left to sail months ago knowing that he would miss our baby\u2019s little milestones, with hopes of reuniting with us by mid-July. I was eagerly waiting for him to return at least by the time she starts walking. But it sure looks like he is going to miss that too as the sailors could only reach back home when the international flight operations resume. As the wait for this global stand-still to end continues - I miss him. It pains me to see our baby play every day without even realizing she has a father who on the other side is sailing the oceans, eagerly waiting to come home to her. I constantly realized how important it is to not take what you have for granted as for us, spending time together as a family seemed a luxury. It has been almost three months since we went out or had any visitors. Friends and family stayed away in concern of the baby. But now I am perturbed as she is starting to show stranger-anxiety at the mere sight of people passing by. \nThis lockdown helped me immensely in changing the way I perceived the world. I learnt it takes just a microbe to bring us humans to our knees and discovered the power of nature to restore itself. People who never once slowed down in their lives are taking a break. These days my husband and I, though shores apart, are co-writing an autobiographical fiction and we are looking forward to get it published by the end of this year. My baby and I still wait here looking forward to little things like these which means the world to us. After all, this is what hope is all about, isn\u2019t it?\n\n@anjoalphonse #journal_hope #hope #love #stayhome  #change #survival #pandemic  #family #baby #parents #sailing #lockdowndiaries #instagood #quarantine","NumberOfLikes":24,"Hashtags":["#journal_hope","#hope","#love","#stayhome","#change","#survival","#pandemic","#family","#baby","#parents","#sailing","#lockdowndiaries","#instagood","#quarantine"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1595737358,"LocalDate":"Sun Jul 26 06:22:38 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"ostrich.nuts.mist","CaptionText":"Milky eyes \n#lockdowndiaries #nikondslr #quarantineandchill #lockdowninspiration #photography2020","NumberOfLikes":9,"Hashtags":["#lockdowndiaries","#nikondslr","#quarantineandchill","#lockdowninspiration","#photography2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Ostrich.nuts.mist on July 25, 2020.

Wouldn\u2019t trade it for an extra hour of sleep - not now at least. \n\nI now know the time without looking at my watch when the fifth floor Aunty throws rice on her balcony for birds every morning. I know the days when fourth floor family makes paratha or poha for breakfast. 🙈🥞🍝🍛🤸\u200D♀️🤸\u200D♀️\n\nI can watch the cloud endlessly while they traverse from one end of my horizon to other, chasing the sun or running away from it. 🏞🌠\n\nSome days when cheeku is with me we look at the sprightly sparrows bobbing up and down. We weave stories about them being three friends playing hop scotch and hide n seek. In the lawn, under the bench, inside the bushes. 🐦 🦅 \n\nEvery morning is shiny, is new. Then the day takes over to make it same. Sometimes busy, sometimes dreary, many times frustrating. Until I wake up to unravel a new morning again. 🌞\n\n#lockdown #lockdown2020 #lockdowndiaries #coronavírus #being #living #life #breathing #fitness #fitmom #peace #morning #mumbai #morningsun","NumberOfLikes":30,"Hashtags":["#lockdown","#lockdown2020","#lockdowndiaries","#coronavírus","#being","#living","#life","#breathing","#fitness","#fitmom","#peace","#morning","#mumbai","#morningsun"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Rashmi on July 25, 2020.

There were other aspects he enjoyed too.\n\u201CIt was great to be forced to slow down in my personal life. There were no interruptions and I was able to spend more time with my boyfriend Janusz. He\u2019s a baker and has loved having time to make more elaborate things.\u201D\nSimon - pictured here with his dog Nigel - has lived in Brighton all his life. He says it\u2019s difficult to visit Poland where his partner is from because of the political landscape, particularly since the recent re-election of President Andrzej Duda.\n\u201CHe wants to eradicate the LGBT community and has set up LGBT-free zones. My boyfriend feels ashamed of it,\u201D he said.\nThe couple, who met two years ago, have no plans to leave Brighton. \n\u201CNowhere else is as accepting. The people make it what it is. When I go on holiday I actually look forward to coming home.

Thanks to my foodie friend @manthenaanupama for the suggestion. Contrasting textures like smooth & crispy can never go wrong.  Monsoon is my favourite season minus this year of course. But in general it gears up your mood,  the relaxation from heat, the new playlist for drive, the switch from chocolate shakes to hot chocolate, the guilt free fried food menu, after all we take only those things for granted which are the closest, case in point fried food here. All this most definitely gives you a different high.  I haven\u2019t felt more connected to food what lockdown has made me feel. A deep sense of gratitude for every small ingredient that I get on time at my door step when I am genuinely craving to cook something fancy. Every plate I cook makes me so excited.

In 1672, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj captured it from Adilshah. The first to be seen on this fort is the Hemadpanthi temple of Bhairavnath with a different style. There are overlays, arches and lanterns around the temple. There is a flagpole and a cannon on the bastion in front of the temple. As you walk along the path behind the temple, you will see a magnificent mansion built of laterite stone. There are remnants of main court on the fort. As you walk along the footpath near the fort, you come across the magnificent Dudhsagar Lake. The water in it has become milky in color due to the properties of the soil. There is a beautiful armed idol of Adishakti Bhavani Mata in the ruined Bhavani Mandir near the lake. If you continue on the straight path to the east, there is remnant of an entrance of the fort. There are 2 dry wells and two lakes.\n\n@virajt_dd11 @girlonthemountains @rupali_kamtekar @aniketkhedekar_ @shodhashodh @jayedeepjagtap1 and Me 😉","NumberOfLikes":79,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1595692517,"LocalDate":"Sat Jul 25 17:55:17 CEST 2020","Location":"Bhudargad Fort"},{"Owner":"ragee_rgs","CaptionText":"Since my page name and design was not final... hereby i am posting my earlier posts in my official frame.

I havent written any poems, done any crafts or written opinion articles. It\u2019s not that I havent tried. I have. But my \u201Ccreative juices\u201D 🧃have been wrung dry. \n.\nThis #lockdown has given us free time , perhaps too much free time. 🕙 Time that I otherwise would have been spent studying, at university or out with my friend. Now I had all this free time, it was a little overwhelming.  Having intensely focused on filling the gaps in my days with something creative, it made that time feel more obligatory than inspired. \n.\nSoon enough I realised that I did not have to conquer the world in one day. So I decided to stop trying to cram everything into 24hours and instead take time to focus on me and engage in creative and mind freeing activities when it felt necessary. As my mum says : \u201Ctoo much of anything is never good for you\u201D\n.\nDuring this time I allowed myself to detach from the moment and focus on me. An activity which helped me a lot with this was #yoga 🧎🏽\u200D♀️ ( not the intense flexible yoga, more of the sit on the floor and listen to calming music one ). It helped me to be more mindful and selfaware and it is something I highly recommend to others. Even if it\u2019s just for a few minutes in the morning, trust me it really helps ! \n. \nPS . If you\u2019ve read this far down, congratulations you probably don\u2019t need yoga, as you seem to have a lot of patience 🤪\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#latenightthoughts #2amthoughts #mythoughts #instawrites #writersblog #selfmusings #wordsfromtheheart #instathoughts #thinkingoutloud #liveforyourself #randomthoughts #pondering #thinkings #thinkingminds #howifeel #meaningoflife #quarantinediaries #corona #lockdownlife #lockdowndiaries #lifeinlockdown #malayali #indian #poet","NumberOfLikes":15,"Hashtags":["#lockdown","#yoga","#latenightthoughts","#2amthoughts","#mythoughts","#instawrites","#writersblog","#selfmusings","#wordsfromtheheart","#instathoughts","#thinkingoutloud","#liveforyourself","#randomthoughts","#pondering","#thinkings","#thinkingminds","#howifeel","#meaningoflife","#quarantinediaries","#corona","#lockdownlife","#lockdowndiaries","#lifeinlockdown","#malayali","#indian","#poet"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Rahel   .\u2022.

I\u2019ve missed you all but it\u2019s been a crazy week and we had to much to do, I couldn\u2019t spare a minute for Instagram. Apologies but I know you understand.\n\nSo two quick things I wanted to tell you...\nFirstly here in the UK we have all got to wear our masks inside for various places starting today. Well this morning I went to get petrol(gas for my American friends) where I had my very first interaction with people that morning. It was not a good one. I was heart broken to see a poor shop assistant pleeding with a man to put a face covering on. No one deserves to be spoken to like that poor woman was. She was just doing her job and trying to keep herself safe as well as customers who may be vulnerable. So today we wanted to give you a kind and friendly reminder to please cover your face and wash your hands!\n\nNo one wants to wear these stupid masks and no one wants to be in the midst of a pandemic but here we are! So let\u2019s all remember to be kind, sympathetic and understanding! If you really don\u2019t want to wear a mask then that is totally fine, there are plenty of great options that mean you don\u2019t have to go into the shops. The man at the petrol station today could have paid at the pump and avoided ever entering the store. If you need shopping, get home delivery! There is no reason to treat others badly just get a mask or don\u2019t go in!\n\nRant over! 😂\n\nMy next thing that I wanted to say is that we have a very special house guest staying for two weeks! (Check out our stories!) She\u2019s staying at the wonky dog hotel while her family are on vacation! Her mom and I discussed it a long time ago, neither of us wanted her staying in kennels so it just made sense that she came back for a visit! We are reintroducing everyone tonight but we\u2019ve been home for an hour and it\u2019s already like she never left!\n.\n.\n.\n#weareinthistogether #wearamask #wearyourmask #😷 #wearadamnmask #bemoremaggie #coronavirusmemes #coronavirus #coronamemes #lockdowndiaries #lockdown2020 #lockdownuk #coronasucks #londondogsofinstagram #dogsofl","NumberOfLikes":22,"Hashtags":["#Repost","#weareinthistogether","#wearamask","#wearyourmask","#😷","#wearadamnmask","#bemoremaggie","#coronavirusmemes","#coronavirus","#coronamemes","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdown2020","#lockdownuk","#coronasucks","#londondogsofinstagram","#dogsofl"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Marie on July 25, 2020.

I\u2019ve missed you all but it\u2019s been a crazy week and we had to much to do, I couldn\u2019t spare a minute for Instagram. Apologies but I know you understand.\n\nSo two quick things I wanted to tell you...\nFirstly here in the UK we have all got to wear our masks inside for various places starting today. Well this morning I went to get petrol(gas for my American friends) where I had my very first interaction with people that morning. It was not a good one. I was heart broken to see a poor shop assistant pleeding with a man to put a face covering on. No one deserves to be spoken to like that poor woman was. She was just doing her job and trying to keep herself safe as well as customers who may be vulnerable. So today we wanted to give you a kind and friendly reminder to please cover your face and wash your hands!\n\nNo one wants to wear these stupid masks and no one wants to be in the midst of a pandemic but here we are! So let\u2019s all remember to be kind, sympathetic and understanding! If you really don\u2019t want to wear a mask then that is totally fine, there are plenty of great options that mean you don\u2019t have to go into the shops. The man at the petrol station today could have paid at the pump and avoided ever entering the store. If you need shopping, get home delivery! There is no reason to treat others badly just get a mask or don\u2019t go in!\n\nRant over! 😂\n\nMy next thing that I wanted to say is that we have a very special house guest staying for two weeks! (Check out our stories!) She\u2019s staying at the wonky dog hotel while her family are on vacation! Her mom and I discussed it a long time ago, neither of us wanted her staying in kennels so it just made sense that she came back for a visit! We are reintroducing everyone tonight but we\u2019ve been home for an hour and it\u2019s already like she never left!\n.\n.\n.\n#weareinthistogether #wearamask #wearyourmask #😷 #wearadamnmask #bemoremaggie #coronavirusmemes #coronavirus #coronamemes #lockdowndiaries #lockdown2020 #lockdownuk #coronasucks #londondogsofinstagram #dogsoflondon #dogsofbrighton #brightondogs #dogsofgreatbritain #blinddogsofinstagram","NumberOfLikes":42680,"Hashtags":["#weareinthistogether","#wearamask","#wearyourmask","#😷","#wearadamnmask","#bemoremaggie","#coronavirusmemes","#coronavirus","#coronamemes","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdown2020","#lockdownuk","#coronasucks","#londondogsofinstagram","#dogsoflondon","#dogsofbrighton","#brightondogs","#dogsofgreatbritain","#blinddogsofinstagram"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":706,"Timestamp":1595613105,"LocalDate":"Fri Jul 24 19:51:45 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"spam_tales","CaptionText":"Why not??????????????\n✨For more follow : @spam_tales \n#spamtales #quotes #poetry #poem #writer #writingcommunity #writersofinstagram #poemsdaily #poet #quotes #quoteoftheday #quotestoliveby #thoughtoftheday #thoughts #writersofindia #inspiration #lockdownstory #lockdowndiaries #lockdownlife #lovequotes #loveline","NumberOfLikes":19,"Hashtags":["#spamtales","#quotes","#poetry","#poem","#writer","#writingcommunity","#writersofinstagram","#poemsdaily","#poet","#quotes","#quoteoftheday","#quotestoliveby","#thoughtoftheday","#thoughts","#writersofindia","#inspiration","#lockdownstory","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdownlife","#lovequotes","#loveline"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by 𝙎𝙋𝘼𝙈 𝙏𝘼𝙇𝙀𝙎 on July 24, 2020.

When lord Ram along with his wife and younger brother came back from the exile of 14 years, every one in their kingdom was happy.\n\nAfter the coronation of lord Ram, It has been observed that there were several opinions in the community regarding the coronation of Goddess Sita as the queen of the state.\n\nThese opinions were like how the king can appoint her as the queen of the state without even proving her sanctity infront of the public.\n\nSo, it was the outcome that goddess sita has to go for another exile in order to maintain the dignity of the state.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\nThat's why, it is said that one should first try to put themselves in other's shoes first before judging.

The pre-recorded interviews take place via Zoom and are posted every Tuesday afternoon. You can find them all on the Different Strokes website, Facebook page and YouTube channel - but over the next couple of weeks, a snippet of each already posted to the DS channels are going to be introduced to our wonderful Instagram audience, to give everyone a taster of personal affiliation with each survivor.\u2063\n\u2063\nLockdown interview number four features stroke survivors Sheelagh and Greet. Sheelagh is our Administrator at Different Strokes. She had her stroke in 2018 at the age of 51. Greet works for the NHS and had her stroke just six months ago at the age of 45. Greet spoke to Sheelagh about her misdiagnosis during stroke and her diagnoses after stroke - Wallenberg Syndrome and Central Post Stroke Pain. During lockdown, Greet chats about the difficulties of being disabled with social restrictions, what it\u2019s like having a vibrant little boy in the early chapters of post stroke recovery, missing out on seeing and staying with family in Belgium and replacement exercises she\u2019s been doing to substitute her usual routine. She also talks about the after effects of her stroke, how lucky she felt to be receiving quality aftercare just before the pandemic struck, problems with work, how her stroke will now give her extra empathy being a child physiotherapist in her new job and how the support from Different Strokes has helped her come to terms with her new life.\u2063\n\u2063\nCatch the full interview at:\u2063\n🔗 https:\/\/differentstrokes.co.uk\/stroke-survivor-experiences-during-lockdown\/\u2063\n▶️ https:\/\/youtu.be\/nNBMW414umk\u2063\n👍🏼 https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/differentstrokescharity\/\u2063","NumberOfLikes":17,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1595589016,"LocalDate":"Fri Jul 24 13:10:16 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"aesthetically_pleasing_girls","CaptionText":"@aazthasharma \n\n#savage #glam #gladiator #gladiatorheels #black #ootd #ootn #outfitinspo #stairs #indoorphotography #poser #fitgirls #instadaily #instagood #outfitoftheday #quarantine #lockdowndiaries #dressup  #homephotoshoot #kneehigh #shoes #shoelover #shoesaddict #style #styleblogger #blogger #photography #indoor #black #xoxo","NumberOfLikes":3,"Hashtags":["#savage","#glam","#gladiator","#gladiatorheels","#black","#ootd","#ootn","#outfitinspo","#stairs","#indoorphotography","#poser","#fitgirls","#instadaily","#instagood","#outfitoftheday","#quarantine","#lockdowndiaries","#dressup","#homephotoshoot","#kneehigh","#shoes","#shoelover","#shoesaddict","#style","#styleblogger","#blogger","#photography","#indoor","#black","#xoxo"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by pics on July 24, 2020.

My saree pallu drape has changed with the time so would like to share one memory connected to it in short. Since childhood I have been around beautiful ladies with colorful sarees full time and highly fascinated by them.\n\nWhen I got engaged, I used to drape in 1. Pleated pallu style as I was not fully confident and was too much concern about saree coming out 😬. \nAfter marriage 2.Head drape was compulsory and as I was not use to it I use to put so many pins on head to set the pallu.\nDuring pregnancy I use to prefer 3. Wrapped around shoulder drape to cover my tummy ( use to feel shy😜).When kids were small half of the time my saree pallu was 4.  tucked in petticoat for free movement.\n Later when kids grew up was little free from taking them in Lap so started with 5. Flowing drape. \nToday when girls grew up , I take help of my girls in styling my sarees and selection of  blouse and accessories. Now I am 100% confident and I love to wear and carry myself  in different styles. Being a saree lover,I love to try and  take  saree styling  to newer, trendier heights.\nYou may not realize, but the modest pallu has the power to make or break your saree look from traditional to uber chic by varying pallu drapes. I remember sometimes I use to do certain changes while tieing  and carrying  saree and pallu to look slimmer,  taller, sometimes to add an illusion of weight.🙈\n\n❓Ladies Which one is your fav pallu drape ???\nAnd gentlemens which drape you like the most???\n123\n456\n\nDo share your pallu drape stories👍\n#smilemore #photooftheday❤️ #styleblogger #style \n#lockdowndiaries #loveforsarees❤️\n#motivationalquotes #chennaiinfluencer #chennaimommyblogger  #spiritualawakening #instamom #mommybloggers #mombloggersofindia  #fashionlover #fashionbloggerindia #igram #explorepage #stylegram #lookoftheday  #affordablefashion  #styleblogger  #pictoftheday  #fashionlover #fashionbloggerindia #igram #stylegram #iconiclook #personalstyle #ss07insta # brands2bloggers","NumberOfLikes":146,"Hashtags":["#smilemore","#photooftheday❤️","#styleblogger","#style","#lockdowndiaries","#loveforsarees❤️","#motivationalquotes","#chennaiinfluencer","#chennaimommyblogger","#spiritualawakening","#instamom","#mommybloggers","#mombloggersofindia","#fashionlover","#fashionbloggerindia","#igram","#explorepage","#stylegram","#lookoftheday","#affordablefashion","#styleblogger","#pictoftheday","#fashionlover","#fashionbloggerindia","#igram","#stylegram","#iconiclook","#personalstyle","#ss07insta"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Meraki on July 24, 2020.

Art in times of lockdown..\n\"From the start of this Pandemic, I wanted to doodle my thoughts on paper. I was already designing memes when my undergraduate project advisor approached me to continue our science communication initiative Brain Matters by publishing a e-magazine in this lockdown that helps people express their thoughts and emotions through write ups, poems and illustrations. From school children to PhD students, we have received some great works, that my advisor has thoughtfully organised in this E Magazine called \"A Lockdown Diary\". Students highlighted how they are coping up with stress, lack of motivation to work and other kinds of confusion and emotional turmoils they might be facing. \nI started dealing with my stress by making some memes, sketching, doodling and restarting my food blog. I was given the responsibility to design the magazine cover and this idea of me trapped in this pandemic world focusing on all things that is happening around me gradually conceptualised layer by layer. The cover only comprises stuff happening till Lockdown 4.0 as that was the time when the magazine was released.

We are taking the travel ban as a blessing in disguise, as this is giving us an opportunity to live in a different city in the US. On the first day, we figured that how comfortably we could walk in cities like Manhattan, that won\u2019t be the case in Miami. It is not well connected by public transport. Our first tip to enjoy South Beach and its surrounding is to buy a bicycle, if you are here to stay long term and don\u2019t have access to a car. There are bicycle paths all across the cities and we found it to be an awesome experience. One of our favorite and most visited area was the Art Deco district, made up of 800+ buildings and structures built between 1923 and 1943. It is said that the Art Deco district had many architectural styles representing political roots and philosophical influences.\n\n#MiamiBeach #MiamiBeachLife #MiamiBeachFlorida\n#SouthBeach #MiamiArt #OceanDrive #Summervibes #MiamiLife\n #MiamiTourism #MiamiArchitecture #ArtDecoMiami #PastelHues #exploreMiami #exploremore\n #lockdowndiaries #exploreFlorida \n #MiamisFinest\n #funinthesun\n#travelstories #neverstopexploring \n#worldcaptures #nakedplanet \n#TravelWideLiveDeep\n#endlessdiscovery\n#googlepixel3xl  #traveldiaries2020 \n#DetourDiaries","NumberOfLikes":27,"Hashtags":["#MiamiBeach","#MiamiBeachLife","#MiamiBeachFlorida","#SouthBeach","#MiamiArt","#OceanDrive","#Summervibes","#MiamiLife","#MiamiTourism","#MiamiArchitecture","#ArtDecoMiami","#PastelHues","#exploreMiami","#exploremore","#lockdowndiaries","#exploreFlorida","#MiamisFinest","#funinthesun","#travelstories","#neverstopexploring","#worldcaptures","#nakedplanet","#TravelWideLiveDeep","#endlessdiscovery","#googlepixel3xl","#traveldiaries2020","#DetourDiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":7,"Timestamp":1595549091,"LocalDate":"Fri Jul 24 02:04:51 CEST 2020","Location":"South Beach, Miami"},{"Owner":"nabeelaskitchenette","CaptionText":"MADE DONUTS 🍩\nFor the full recipe.

With the  idealisation of the newfound \"Instagram worthy aesthetics\", predominance of studio based ceramic pottery and glass has been rapidly replacing the omnipresent culinary traditions of Indian kitchens, one of them being the usuage of steel utensils, which goes without saying. \n\nTaking into consideration this whole idea of reviving our rustic everyday aesthetics and normalising it to the larger spectrum of audience, today's recipe was prepared. \n\nDal is almost a regular staple in every other Indian diet, however in comforting forms. Alongside, we Bengalis tend to eat our beloved fish portions in any form. Maacher muro diye moongh dal, roughly translating to fishhead cooked in a thick aromatic lentil soup is quite a significant part of the Bengali cuisine. \n\nIn my opinion, this is a recipe that has always belonged to mothers over the centuries and shall stay the same, an everlasting piece of childhood memory collected from my days in Calcutta.\n#SteelTheShow\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#artofvisuals #bleachmyfilm #culinarytales #CalcuttaCacophony #desserts #desi_diaries #lowcarb #lockdowndiaries #everydayindia #exploreveerything #foodsofindia #foodporn #foodblog #food #ig_food #inspiroindia #iiframe #moodygrams #mypixeldiary #moodyindia #spilledink #theunographymag #theuncommonbox #thecuratormag #_soi","NumberOfLikes":125,"Hashtags":["#SteelTheShow","#artofvisuals","#bleachmyfilm","#culinarytales","#CalcuttaCacophony","#desserts","#desi_diaries","#lowcarb","#lockdowndiaries","#everydayindia","#exploreveerything","#foodsofindia","#foodporn","#foodblog","#food","#ig_food","#inspiroindia","#iiframe","#moodygrams","#mypixeldiary","#moodyindia","#spilledink","#theunographymag","#theuncommonbox","#thecuratormag","#_soi"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by U t s a on July 23, 2020.

Shopping Fast Fashion - Fashion is the world\u2019s second most polluting industry all thanks to fast fashion\u2019s cheap and unscrupulous processes. Buy less and choose better. Follow the #30wears rule. \n\n2. Traditional calendars - Don\u2019t you think calendars are among the most wasteful single-use products? This year I shifted to a plantable calendar bought from @ecoindian  and FYI I\u2019m growing tomatoes, marigold and tulsi this year 🌿\n\n3. Tumble drying your clothes - \nAn average drying-machine cycle uses just over 4kWh of energy and produces around 1.8kg CO2. If all households with a tumble dryer dried one load of washing outside each week, instead of by machine, they would save over a million tonnes of CO2 in a year. \nIn short, tumble dry sucks so pls dry your clothes in the sun🌞\n\n4. Animal tested skincare - There is just no excuse for using products that have been tested on animals. And it\u2019s unfortunate that a lot of big brands still do animal testing but the good news is that there are SO MANY new, small and local brands that are cruelty free, organic and a lot of other awesome things. \n\n5. Don\u2019t be a spectator. Take action - Sustainability is a way of life that appreciates all forms of life and provides the pathways for collective prosperity. The time to watch from the sidelines is long gone. You are a key part of this global revolution. Realise your responsibility and act on it. \n\nThat\u2019s it for now! I hope these points get you thinking and that you can start making more informed and responsible lifestyle choices💫\n\nStay strong, stay safe 🌸\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n#sustainablefashion #sustainableliving #consciousliving #naturelover #traveldiaries #stylediaries #lifestyle #goodvibesonly #instadaily #lifestyleblogger #ootdfashion #healthylifestyle #quarantinelife #lockdowndiaries #goodvibesonly✨ #igfashion","NumberOfLikes":358,"Hashtags":["#30wears","#sustainablefashion","#sustainableliving","#consciousliving","#naturelover","#traveldiaries","#stylediaries","#lifestyle","#goodvibesonly","#instadaily","#lifestyleblogger","#ootdfashion","#healthylifestyle","#quarantinelife","#lockdowndiaries","#goodvibesonly✨","#igfashion"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Sanah Mehra in Planet Earth with @sanahsharmaofficial.

He shares some of the challenges and changes he has faced as a Customer Partnership Manager: \n\n\u201CFor a guy who is used to hopping around the city meeting people in their local communities, this was a breakneck change of pace. The social aspect of my job is what gets me up in the morning. Although technology has enabled us do things that wouldn't have been possible in the past, I still believe that there is no replacing face to face connection. At times it has been hard to accept the limitations. However, these challenges have motivated the whole team to find new ways to connect and support our people.\n\nFurther, the lack of noise has also proven an opportunity to think clearly about what is important to me, and it seems that our residents and communities feel the same. From what I have heard, there has been a real positive response to this lockdown. There is a desire from all quarters, to be more actively involved in where they live, work and play. From the NHS clap, to supporting their vulnerable neighbours; the response has been amazing across London. Everyone I have spoken to wants this spirit of care and empathy to continue long after this is over.\n\nAnd we at NPG are ready to help them do it.\u201D \n\n#lockdowndiaries #workingfromhomelife #office #customerexperience","NumberOfLikes":10,"Hashtags":["#lockdowndiaries","#workingfromhomelife","#office","#customerexperience"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Navana Property Group on July 23, 2020.
