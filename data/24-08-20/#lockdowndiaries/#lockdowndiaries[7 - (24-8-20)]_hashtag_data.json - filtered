Be it your family, your friends, or your partner, it's all about who you wanna tell what you gonna tell! At the end of the day, it's about who you want to celebrate your life with.\n\nI know many of the couples who cancelled their wedding due to the lockdown, because they couldn't have their big fat Indian wedding. And you know what they are not wrong, we have been conditioned to fantasise our dream wedding in a way and if you don't get to do it, it's definitely not fair. Of course most of us plan to do it only once, then why not do it right, am I right? \n\nWhile I completely understand where these people are coming from, I also know a few who got married in the lockdown. Their plans got tossed left, right, and centre but it wasn't good enough to make them wait to spend their lives together. And now they are living their happily ever after. \n\nAm no judge here, but isn't marriage about celebrating your life everyday with the one person you are in love with, or does the number of witnesses to the occasion supersede that spirit? I know it's unfair not getting to celebrate your union the way you imagined, but don't you think it's unfair too to wait to be together? \n\nIf you are holding up your wedding because people are going to feel bad, don't! Imagine how happy it's going to make you both and do it. Tie the knot because at the end of the day, it won't matter how big the wedding was, but how big your marriage is! \n\nPS: This doesn't include any of those who got married in the lockdown violating all measures of social distancing. To them, I have got nothing to say that would matter anyway! \n\n#Day24 #lockdowndiaries #lockdownlearnings #lockdown #pandemic #corona #thistooshalpass #staysafe #stayindoors #marriage #wedding #partner #love #truespirit  #shividoodle #doodle #writing #lovewriting #lovemore #onceawriteralwaysawriter #doodlethoughts #randomthoughts #newnormal","NumberOfLikes":27,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Shividoodle in Bangalore, India.

In this, the work seeks to offer a reflection on the relationship we develop with those often-unseen objects that meet our daily needs. Central to the work is a troupe of estrangement that works to reverse an excess of familiarity that commands the life of the everyday and the dictates of the marketplace.

And it has been nice! But it's also involved things like visiting shops I've not been to for months and seeing them full of cordons and plastic shields; seeing the difference for the first time is always more difficult than watching things gradually change. Things like being surrounded by families in the park who are trying to pretend that they're having fun. They were looking forward to having fun, their eyes all say. They don't know what to do now it's miserable here as well.\n\nI know a lot of people have found this time hard, much harder than they thought they would. And they don't know how to say it's been hard because it wasn't supposed to be hard, and being unhappy is always harder when you're somewhere that's meant to be nice. At times like this I often think I need to tell myself a new story that can cope with how messy my actual life and feelings are. I'm not sure I've thought of one quite yet. But I think it's important to admit that I'm trying to find one, rather than to pretend the one I had is working especially well.\n\n#depression #lockdowndiaries #pessimism #depressiondrawing #pandemicart #depressionart #depressionposts","NumberOfLikes":22,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Robert Shepherd in Edinburgh, United Kingdom.

I was Torens primary caregiver and even when I went back to work at the beginning of this year things pretty much were the same.\n.\nThen COVID happened and we were both home for almost 3 months. This meant that the workload and parenting duties were shared more evenly. We have done a complete 180 and while I wake up every day and head out, Tony is home with Toren. He can still work remotely and i unfortunately, can not. When we knew I was going back we had a conversation about whether we should hire someone to help out around the house. The risk though of us potentially getting sick or making someone else sick as I work with little kids all day meant this was a no go.\n.\nSo now Tony spends his days navigating childcare housework, his own work and making us dinner. He was the regular chef pre COVID anyway. \nNow I am.not good with change and i wasnt so sure about this new normal but so fails working out. Pkus I get cute vids like this during the day.\n.\nRemeber that you and your partner are  in this together and the roles will change with time but what is important is that you keep working as a team to keep things moving.\n.\nThe whole idea of stay at home dads is not so big here but COVID is really forcing us to re-evaluate things.

Hopefully just 4 more to go! 🤞🏻 (please!!!)\n\nYesterday I was sad. \nToday the anger set in. \nI took myself for an angry walk - I literally felt like I spent the first half stomping down the street like a petulant child. Podcasts did not help. Everyone\u2019s voice felt irritating today (Irrational? Who me?! 🙋🏻\u200D♀️). But then at the beach, I saw this rock. Random, I know - but stay with me. 😆\n\nWhile the waves and wind crashed around it, the rock remained steady and grounded. \n\nI needed to channel the rock (and I don\u2019t mean THE Rock.

Never underestimate the power of pop music my friends! 🎶\n\nI\u2019m not fully back to myself yet - but thanks to the power of the Beatles, 1D and a random rock on the beach... I\u2019m much better.

During the early days of quarantine, a time when most people in our neighborhood were still very much scared to go out, a husband and wife tandem started selling food here in our place, which they sell thru the Facebook Messenger group chat created specifically to let homeowners sell their goods.\n▪️\nOne of the many dishes I bought from them was this tub of Pansit Palabok, for only 60 pesos (a little over 1usd). It was a different kind of Pansit Palabok - it wasn\u2019t saucy at all, but cooked a la Pansit Bihon Guisado - but it sure tasted great. \n▪️\nUnfortunately, when the quarantine got a little flexible and people started going out (we still don\u2019t have public transportation in the area), they started losing customers and when the husband returned to work, the wife had a difficulty cooking and delivering goods by herself, that they stopped selling.\n▪️\nI hope they\u2019d return, even during weekends. Every food I bought from them tasted good, never had any complaints, and their business grew significantly in that short amount of time. At first they didn\u2019t care much about presentation until one person expressed her dismay, which made them change their whole way of doing the business. Sure there are some food sellers that are still thriving, and some new players entered the game offering more choices, but I miss eating their food.\n▪️\nAs for me, it did come across my mind to sell food, too... but I am alone. Just doing everything all by myself - going to the market, preparing, cooking, packing, delivering... all using my two legs and hands (as we don\u2019t have any vehicle), plus answering to inquires, seemed a little too much for me to bear. If my mom and sister were here, we\u2019d push for it. \n______________\n#pansitpalabok #pancitpalabok #pansit #pancit #lockdowndiaries #fooddelivery #food #foodphotography #foodstagram #foodstagramph #filipinofood #filipinocuisine #lutongpinoy #lutongbahay #foodtrip #seemslegeat #eatpilipinas #kainpilipinas #pagkaingpinoy #kainpinoy #foodinspiration","NumberOfLikes":45,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Jenny Jayne in Caloocan.

My day use to be lot busy due to work & after that for next 2-3 days I made plans with my friends and cousins for the evening & use to return back to my hotel by night. It was used to be busy days & I didn't have time or I'll say I never took time to call back home to my parents & if they call I just use to say - I am busy will call you back. Then next couple of days I explore the city alone. Getting pack up from office work & collegues, I use to take local, get down to nearest station of the location I wanted to visit then walk back 9-10 kms to my hotel exploring the streets and places on the way.\n\nDays later I felt homesick, I called home & spoke with my parents. That time I really felt their importance, it was not like that I never knew their importance but you know there are those little moments when you feel such things more deeply. The one who gave birth to us & the one who never lost hope on us deserve importance & love than we actually give them.\n\nBut as time flies we start highlighting our differences.We start building our own wall of privacy & it they enter without our permission it angers us. In the end we sum up it as 'generation gap', the perfect excuse to avoid a talk & ending conversation with them is 'you won't understand'.\n\nYear changes & we leave our childhood behind us,we start becoming independent, not only with our finances but also at our daily routine.The need to inform,talk, daily little conversations get reduces. We start prioritizing things over them, friends,work & money suddenly seems more important.\n\nWe Learn the value of things when it's not with us & that moment when I spoke with them I felt that. That guilt of ignorance was there, at that time I was not able to express it to them.\nI felt that all we can do is appreciate their love & care & give as much importance to them while we can. Giving love back to them is the best we can do.\n\nThere is a line that hit me hard from Kota factory-'our parents decision may be wrong regarding us but their intention behind it would never be'\n#shortstories #lockdowndiaries #writingstories #parentslove #storiestotell","NumberOfLikes":54,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by DARSHAN PINGAT in Marine Drive Mumbai.

Finally Stepped out of my house after almost 3 months. First Stop:- M.A.C.! @maccosmeticsindia My Shopoholic soul needed some retail therapy. Bought 2 Lipsticks\/ Liquid Lip Colours from Their Newly Launched Powder Kiss Liquid Lipstick Formulas. Wearing \u2018Sorry Not Sorry\u2019.. A Gorgeous Soft Coral\/Orangy shade. \n\nI also experimented blending this shade with M.A.C\u2019s Classic Matte Lipstick in the colour \u2018Yash\u2019. The result was a Lighter, Muted peach version of this colour. \nBasically have tried all tips and tricks to check its versatility. Since It\u2019s on the expensive side, & Due to the current COVID scenario, you cannot try it on in the stores. So if you\u2019re unsure how this formulation will look on your complexions, then I suggest you wait. (Speaking From Personal Experience:- As mentioned Above.., I Bought The Classic Matte Lipstick in \u2018Yash\u2019 online. It\u2019s A gorgeous nude that completely washed out my complexion. It looks lovely on Indian skin tones though. Mine unfortunately is extremely fair with a prominent pink undertone so it didn\u2019t suit me. Hence, I\u2019m now left with no other choice besides using it as a Blending medium for my other darker shaded lipsticks). Hope this review helps all my kindred spirited lipstick addict friends here.

We won inter school championships and that was just so much fun. \n\n2 weeks ago in a casual chat with my dear friend @zinianatashafernandes , she suggested the series @thelastdancenetflix .I have definitely heard of Michael Jordan if not followed him +\nI am a fan of sports documentaries because I have been a sportsperson all my life so I sat down to watch this 10 episode documentary and here are my learnings.\n\n1️\u20E3Michael AIR Jordan is considered one of the greatest not just because he was skilled\/talented\/genius but because he has been sharpening that axe rigorously even after winning a tournament. It was what he did outside the court that made him a champion on the court\n2️\u20E3The bigger the star you are the bigger the trolls and controversy. In the era of NO social media he was a darling of the masses but the reporters and paparazzi tried everything to pull him down too. It did take a strong mind to evade the off court gossip to make on court winning headlines .\n3️\u20E3Attitude of a Winner- He wasn\u2019t bothered what his teammates thought if him. All he knew was to win that shot each & everytime. So yes his passion would have rubbed the wrong ways across his team mates but on the court he was a fighter and off the court a serial chiller.\n4️\u20E3 SELF VALUE- You can see in the subsequent episodes of how he valued his time\/himself .He\u2019d put in extra hours of practice to avoid smoking up with colleagues or for that matter his endorsements . High Self Value got him the highest paid endorsements. \n5️\u20E3MJ was not MJ without Scottie Pippen,Dennis Ridman, Steve Kerr & his coach Phil Jackson. So yes it takes teamwork to make the dreamwork\n\nWatching this series made me dribble different expressions, such a thrilling finish to a game of mastery that passed the ball of high emotions.

Just like this super fun and easy art idea. All we needed were paints, forks and a earbud! And N decided that this was to be a family project, so we all joined in 😄.\n@firstcryintelli Is also a one stop channel where one can get answers to so many parenting related questions via their live series.

His video on Triller for the\r\nsong has garnered upwards of 11.7 million global plays as of press time\r\n(July 13), according to Triller.\r\nTalking about achieving this feat, @armaanmalik says, \u201CIt\u2019s such an amazing feeling to top both these charts. As an Indian, I see this as a step forward to\r\nfurther my dream of taking India to the world.\u201D\n\r\nBollywood celebrities like Tiger Shroff, Siddhant Chaturvedi, Vishal\r\nDadlani, Salim Merchant, and more congratulated Armaan for making his\r\ncountry proud.\n\r\nReleased in the midst of the pandemic, \u201Cnext 2 me\u201D describes the feeling of\r\nmissing your loved ones and wishing they were right there by your side in a\r\nlight-hearted and hopeful manner with an uptempo production. \u201CThe global\r\nlockdown has been tough on all of us, especially for those who are\r\nquarantined away from their loved ones. We may have all the devices in\r\nthe world to keep us connected but having that person next to you is a\r\ndifferent feeling altogether, something that no digital connection can ever\r\ncompare to,\u201D added the 24-year-old.\n\r\nArmaan had teased this single during his Billboard Live At-Home\r\nperformance on their Facebook page for a COVID-19 fundraiser, which\r\naccording to Pollstar, was ranked 12th on the world\u2019s most popular live\r\nstream charts for the week ending June 8.\n\r\nMalik has always spoken about wanting to break into the English pop and\r\nseems well on his way to achieving that aim. First by being spotted on\r\nSpotify Times Square Billboard in New York with his debut international release 'Control' followed by topping Billboard charts with his second\rEnglish single 'next 2 me'.\n\r\nApart from his English music, Armaan has been consistently putting out\r\nchartbuster music across languages, the recent one being his new Hindi\r\nsingle \u2018Zara Thehro\u2019.\n\n@armaanmalik #armaanmalik @armaanmalik22 @billboardcharts #billboardcharts @kushprbrand #nexttome #music #musiclover #bollywoodstars #bollywoodupdates24x7 #singers #LockdownDiaries","NumberOfLikes":11,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Manya Ekta Gugliani on July 19, 2020 tagging @armaanmalik, and @armaanmalik22.

A good two weeks of study holidays we'll get now!\" Those two weeks snowballed into a month, then two months, and now more than four! Think about that - we've spent a third of this year indoors, and I can speak for all of us when I say that I don't really see the light at the end of the tunnel.⠀\n⠀\nTime and tide wait for no man, and neither does college - we've all been breaking our backs over online classes and those inane assignments, and now we're going where no man has gone before (in the most sarcastic sense of the phrase) and we're writing - or, shall I say, being forced to write - our exams FROM HOME!⠀\n⠀\nImagine, a year ago, if someone told you - You can write your exams in the same place you eat, shit and sleep. We'd all have roflmao-ed big time - but I guess none of us share that sentiment now xD. Very very different times indeed.⠀\n⠀\nAnyway, as we're all at home engineering new ways to ace the exams, here I am posting for the first time in months - a photo I clicked and edited in March (believe it or not!). This beauty was a gift from my mom on my Sweet 16th, and the Tissot T-Race looks good in the outdoors with the golden light of the evening hours giving it a beautiful vibe!⠀\n⠀\nI have been clicking a lot in the lockdown, but haven't gotten the time to edit anything. Once I get back on the saddle, expect to see a lot more posts coming your way!⠀\n⠀\nUntil then, hasta la vista baby!⠀\n⠀\nShot on Fujifilm XA-5 (15-45 mm) ⠀\n⠀\n#tissot #watchphotography #coloursofindia #photooftheday #photographers_of_india #artofvisuals #productphotographer #goodshotz #lonelyplanetindia #cntgiveitashot #maibhisadakchap #ShotOnFujifilm #nustaharamkhor #goldenhour #nammakarnatakaphotographers #bangalorephotographers #fstoppers @artofvisuals #lockdowndiaries #coronacation #hypebeast #followforfollowback #goodshotz @tissot_official #watchaddict #watchoftheday #fujifilm_xseries #fujixa5 #nbanews @tissot.us #MyTissot⠀","NumberOfLikes":189,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Rithvik AR in Brigade Millenium.
