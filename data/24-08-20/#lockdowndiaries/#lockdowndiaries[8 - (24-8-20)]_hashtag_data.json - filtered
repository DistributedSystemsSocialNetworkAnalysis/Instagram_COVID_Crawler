Thinking of the Kebabs makes my mouth watery!! \nKebabs are one of the most delicious meals across the world. Kebabs have been originated from the Middle East and been commonly prepared in the whole sub-continent. Kebabs are also one of the famous meals in Turkish cuisines. \nKebabs are made from the mince of beef, lamb, mutton, chicken, or fish depending on your choice. \nKebab karahi and kebab masala both are very popular in Pakistan as well as in India. I have simplified the recipe using chapli kebab masala which has added an amazing taste and aroma. Using the kebab and gravy makes this meal an amazing combo. It can be eaten with Nan, with rice or chapati. If you taste with paratha, that would make its taste more impressive. Why not you try by yourself, I am sure you will love it 😊 \n\nYoutube: \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UC265gboutsPwS6tEFqYBYvA\n\nFacebook: \nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Cravings-by-AK-101245284555977\/?modal=admin_todo_tour \n\nInstagram: \nhttps:\/\/www.instagram.com\/aana.kash\/ \n\nCopyright-free track: \n* TRACK INFO *\nOriginal Name: Fredji - Happy Life. \nOriginal Author: FREDJI. \nRelease date: 2016-09-18T09:49:27.000Z (18 September 2016). \nSource: https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/fredjimusic\/fredji-happy-life-original-mix\n\nYoutube link for Beef Kebab Karahi: \nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/LPsJj30GUJQ\n\n#beefkababmasala, #beefkababkarahi, #kababkarahi, #beefkebab, #kebab, #specialbeefkebabkarahi, #resturantstylekebabkarahi, #homemadekebabkarahimasala, #stayathome, #covid19, #lockdowndiaries, #lockdowncookingdiaries, #howtomakekebab, #howtomakebeefkebab, #howtomakebeefkebabkarahi, #eidespecial, #barieidspecial, #eiduladhaspecial,","NumberOfLikes":10,"Hashtags":["#beefkababmasala,","#beefkababkarahi,","#kababkarahi,","#beefkebab,","#kebab,","#specialbeefkebabkarahi,","#resturantstylekebabkarahi,","#homemadekebabkarahimasala,","#stayathome,","#covid19,","#lockdowndiaries,","#lockdowncookingdiaries,","#howtomakekebab,","#howtomakebeefkebab,","#howtomakebeefkebabkarahi,","#eidespecial,","#barieidspecial,","#eiduladhaspecial,"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1595152406,"LocalDate":"Sun Jul 19 11:53:26 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Time for some craft!!\nUpcycled a curd container into this colorful planter.

But was able to maintain a balance between my personal and professional life... \n\n✔️Though it was tough spending on luxuries... But it was never difficult to find happiness in small things which I used to ignore earlier.\n\nI found my kinda happiness getting close to my family...\nSpending hours on chit chat..hahha... Late night games... Fighting on covering the red carrom coin.... That was hillarious.... \n\nDancing on winning the Ludo game... Feeling proud when winning the chess game with cousins....even when I had little idea on it... 😂😂😂😂😂😂\n\nGetting annoyed when hubby started cheating while playing cards 🎌🎌🎌\nBut always pampering me and ready for the photoshoot for Instagram 🎥🎥🎥🎥🎥\n\nOhhh Lucky me.. 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊\n\nAll these were my kindaa special time....

Or life throws tantrums at you? I immediately go back to my forever watchlist!\n\n✨ I'd start with the series that's my all the me favourite and even while I'm writing this Instagram post, Miranda Hobbes is staring at me from laptop screen. I mean how could someone exist and not love this?\n\n✨The second one would be quite obvious after this, both the shows ran at the same era and both shows have a plot entirely based on friendship. I can tell now that I am over F.R.I.E.N.D.S., but I kind of  waiting till my next me tal breakdown to take place, and bang! I'd be binge-watching the show for nights!\n\n✨ I don't love Sex and the City movies as much as the series, but still they're my instant mood lifters! Both movies 1 and 2 are my \n\"fashion extravaganza\" escape forever!\n\n✨10 things I hate about you, I entirely watch it from the love and memories of Heath Ledger. Plus, the movie is a very good refreshment!\n\n✨ I've watched Eat,Prey, Love over and over again, at the lowest point of times. Julia Roberts is the reason and soul searching is the cause for this choice.\n\n✨ People who've already familiar with what 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' a masterpiece is have never got over it! Nor did I! I occasionally watch it when I get very emotional at times. And somehow it still manages to mesmerize me like it did at the very first time!\n\n✨ Forrest Gump has the very same reason like the previous one! I never got over it! And I don't think I ever will!\n\n✨ When I want to believe that, 'Love conquers  us all\", I immediately get back to 'The Holiday', obvious reasons are the ensemble cast and of course a younger Jude Law, and in fact the love stories that I solely want to believe in. 🥺\n\n✨ Anne with an E is the youngest watch to be in the list. But I'd stand by my choice, I have never came across such a show that feels exactly I'm going from one page of a book to another, while painting a beautiful picture myself.\n\nWhat show\/movie you never got over with?

I know people are going to look at me whatever I do. Back in Devon where I\u2019m from I\u2019ve had stuff thrown at me down the street. Here, people are so positive. It\u2019s incredible to live in a place where people can be free. And yet it\u2019s hard to believe that it\u2019s so radical - in 2020 - to be yourself. But that\u2019s what it is and that\u2019s why I moved here,\u201D he said. \nMatthew works on new product launches in branding and social media for Irregular Choice, the iconic shoe and fashion brand founded in Brighton. \u201CIt has that unique quality that everyone loves.\u201D\nHe says he has loved fashion since he was a child and was the costume designer for all his school plays. \u201CI used to play with dolls to escape and then I fell in love with clothes.\u201D\nGrowing up, Matthew needed 12 surgeries - the first when he was a baby and the last just two years ago. He says the most difficult was having his jaw broken and realigned which meant he couldn\u2019t eat solid food for three months. He has also had to cope with the psychological impact of the operations.\n\u201CIt\u2019s been crazy, my face keeps changing.\u201D\nMatthew says he has always worn both men\u2019s and women\u2019s clothes. Several years ago, one Halloween whilst studying footwear design at Leicester University, he decided to go out in drag. He then started performing under the pseudonym Dame Deadly, dressing up as Cruella de Vil and other characters.\nMatthew - who describes himself as the sparkly sheep of the family - says his brother, mother and step-dad all work for the NHS. He has been worried about them during the pandemic and has missed them. His flatmate moved home during lockdown, so he spent a lot of time alone at home, working and sewing and experimenting with clothes. Recently, when his mum was finally allowed to visit, she was so pleased to see him looking happy.\n\u201CShe said I looked awake again.\u201D\nMatthew can\u2019t imagine moving back to Devon where he says he was bullied relentlessly as a child.\n\u201CBut they\u2019re all working in Tesco now and I\u2019m branding beautiful shoes in Brighton,\u201D he said.\n#brighton","NumberOfLikes":265,"Hashtags":["#brighton"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Brighton Peeps in Hove Seafront with @irregularchoice, @justinedesmondphoto, @damedeadly, and @daisyoclee.

Link in profile.\n\nThe fallen gateau is one I bake every year, only this year it seems to have gotten better! Indulgent in every possible way, deeply fudgy & earthy, with mild undertones of fresh plum. That ganache resting on top completed the luxury, while plums and cherries in season added a burst of freshness and colour. \n\nThis was one of my final recipes being tested for my cookbook, so please wait for it ♥. \n\nOn another note, I've announced my next food styling worshop, this one is focussed mostly on desserts. Food styling for me is intuitive and fuss free, something that often comes together in 15-20 minutes. Also, if you like what you see, I shoot only in natural light and barely post process.\n\nIf that's what you are looking for, come join me at my workshop. I'll share how to visualise and find your style, shooting in natural light, behind the scenes, using\/sourcing basic props and backgrounds, & plenty of easy hacks too. Also tips on content creation for social media and how to create visually more exciting images.\n \nThe workshop is for anyone who wants to take better food pictures with either the camera or cell phone. You can see some of the feedback from the earlier workshops under the 'online worshop' highlights.

In our individual lives and across the world. \n\nSome of us with privilege are finally waking up to it. Tentatively, but still, so.\n\nSome of us face our demons during lockdown - whether that\u2019s too much time with ourselves, our families or a resetting of identity as we grieve what is lost.\n\nSome of us had to focus on just waking up each day and continuing.\n\nLook at us, in all our ugliness and our beauty. How many of us, despite being afraid, reach for the opportunity to grow. Like plants leaning into sunshine. Like caterpillars into butterflies 🦋 \n\nIn all the chaos there can be pockets of growth and change, little sprouts of hope. Clarity and balance so we can make conscious change.\n\nWhere have you grown? What\u2019s different about you since this all began? I\u2019d love to know. I\u2019m much more committed to rituals of self-care than ever. It took a while to choose this path, but I love it now.\n\nIf you need more mental balance in the chaos, join me online with @tringyogastudio on Sunday (tomorrow) 7pm UK time for a FREE meditation - we will practice kirtan kriya for that clarity so you can take conscious choices in the whirlwind of the world today.

In a research study, it is proved that children who play with blocks when they are 3, 4 and 5 years of age will do better in math, especially Algebra in middle school.\n\nThere is a natural progression of block play and introducing infants and toddlers to block play is invaluable. \n\nRead about this progression here http:\/\/mylittlebookshop.in\/importance-of-playing-with-wooden-blocks\/\n\n#lockdowndiaries #playalongmummies #letthemplay #encouragefreeplay #slowdownmama #mommyinfluencer #waldorfinfluence #waldorftoystore #waldorfindia #toystagram #chooseecofriendly #waldorfhomeschool #homeschoolduringpandemic #kindergartenhomeschool #bangalorehomeschoolers #plasticfreejuly #saynotoworksheets","NumberOfLikes":38,"Hashtags":["#MyLittleBookshop","#lockdowndiaries","#playalongmummies","#letthemplay","#encouragefreeplay","#slowdownmama","#mommyinfluencer","#waldorfinfluence","#waldorftoystore","#waldorfindia","#toystagram","#chooseecofriendly","#waldorfhomeschool","#homeschoolduringpandemic","#kindergartenhomeschool","#bangalorehomeschoolers","#plasticfreejuly","#saynotoworksheets"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1595003791,"LocalDate":"Fri Jul 17 18:36:31 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Been a while.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#LockdownDiaries #HouseArrest #PooBaniParvati","NumberOfLikes":148,"Hashtags":["#LockdownDiaries","#HouseArrest","#PooBaniParvati"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by P O O J A on July 17, 2020.

The COVID effect has been immense as far as damage to life and economy is concerned. The majority of the world's population lived under lockdown. However, some countries have recovered and some haven't yet. \n\nThings in India stand in a very critical corner of life as cases are growing day by day. Some cities which had almost recovered, are again facing the heat of CORONAVIRUS. The government decided to unlock life by removing some restrictions, but as the virus gets spotted again in the community, lockdown seems to be the only option.\n\nA smooth running life is now a part of the memory and nobody knows when life would be back to normal. Sometimes, A ray of hope appears, but the very next moment it fades into the darkness of uncertainty and adversity. \n\nIn the end, what remains in our control is, to wait till the situation gets better because the time when Nature starts playing its cards, man can do nothing more than being a viewers.

I didn't have apple cider vinegar at home so I used white wine vinegar in the dough instead 🥨\n2. For garlic salt and sugar in the pizza sauce recipe, I replaced garlic salt with 1:1 garlic powder\/salt mixture, and sugar with erythritol to keep it Keto 🥫\n3. Who would have thought our local grocer would run out of pepperoni! I blame COVID! So I used spicy Soppressa salami instead 🍕\n\nTips and Tricks 🧑\u200D🍳\n1. THE DOUGH WAS SO STICKY! I covered my hand with oil when dealing it 🤲\n2. IF YOU ARE USING A CAST IRON LIKE I DID, bake the dough for an extra 5 minutes to give the cast iron enough time to heat up!

Thanks for the reco, @jaepickrell, though he is keeping me up all night.\n\nIn 1968, in an interview for the BBC, he was asked, \"Would it be fair to say that you see life as a very funny but cruel joke?\" What follows is some highlights from his answer.\n\nWhose life? What life? Life does not exist without a possessive epithet. Lenin's life differs from, say, James Joyce's as much as a handful of gravel does from a blue diamond... Or take the destinies of Oscar Wilde and Lewis Carroll -- one flaunting a flamboyant perversion and getting caught, and the other hiding his humble but much more evil little secret behind the emulsions of the developing-room, and ending up being the greatest children's story writer of all time... Your term \"life\" is used in a sense which I cannot apply to a manifold shimmer...

Learning basic survival skills is yet another lesson this lock down has taught all of us. Ruchi, my wife, like many of us has turned into a family hair dresser in this lockdown. I must admit it\u2019s not the easiest of the skill to learn and now I have more respect for all the hair dressers who have so long cut my hair same on both right and left side of my face. I promise I will be less demanding when I finally go back to the shops 😄\nRuchi is very proud of her newly acquired skill and I really wanted to document this part of our lives on my canvas. I also think our family had the best hair cuts throughout this lockdown in our neighbourhood 😄😄😄 (What a boastful statement to make !!!😄) \n\nCovid-19 Lockdown has affected each one of us very differently. For some, these have been extremely challenging times while for many it has been time for self reflection, pausing for while and simply looking around and appreciate life and learning new skills.\nSeparation and reflection is what Covid-19 gave us. \n\nIf any of you, my friends and art lovers have a memory of this lockdown, a bitter sweet one, or just a happy one, that you would like me to paint, please feel free to contact me.

The measures and policies which governments have rolled out worldwide ever since Operation Coronavirus began \u2013 such as quarantine, lockdown, hand-washing, mask-wearing, social distancing and more \u2013 are in fact aspects of occult initiation ritual. These aspects have been cleverly adapted to the current fake pandemic and disguised as genuine public health strategies. As I covered in previous articles, this pandemic is a 9-11 type event which has been meticulously planned for decades. The people who run the world, whom I often call the New World Order (NWO) conspirators, leave very little to chance. They are black magicians, and they are running this live exercise in a similar fashion to how they run their secret Satanic rituals.

I bought several candles just before we went into quarantine. It is a reminder of the wonder of natural, organic materials and traditional making, a symbol of Sarajevo\u2019s rich layers and a souvenir of family dinners in lockdown. This candle was quite tall when I bought it, and it burns very, very slowly, so we have enjoyed its light over many, many home-cooked dinners.","NumberOfLikes":14,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @lifewithobjects in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina with @natasaperkovic.","NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1594800942,"LocalDate":"Wed Jul 15 10:15:42 CEST 2020","Location":"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"CaptionText":"#sketch #timepassclick📷 #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":54,"Hashtags":["#sketch","#timepassclick📷","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Faisal Tandel in Navi Mumbai (New Mumbai), India.
