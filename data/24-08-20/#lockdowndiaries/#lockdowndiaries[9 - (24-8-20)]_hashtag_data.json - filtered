I have been feeling so burnt out at work that I am operating at 50% efficiency the last two days. I am delaying writing two line emails and twenty page documents, alike. I am on social media in the daytime doing silly things, scrolling mindlessly, making jokes. No that's not me.\n\nBut I love my work, I thought. This is a busy, awesome season for my work. Lots of launches in progress. And also then there's the entire internet telling me to hustle and be productive (all with good intentions, how I consume the content is on me and not on the creator). Anyway, I am at home, so what will I do with the day off if I take it.\n\nThe answer is, nothing. Sleep, stay away from laptop, eat good food, get an intense workout in, and not feel guilty. Not sure why I am burnt out, but that's not the point. We are dealing with difficult, scary news everyday. We do housework and regular work. We haven't been able to make plans. We haven't seen family in a long time. It's okay for these things to affect me. It does not mean I don't care about my dreams or career or responsibilities. It doesn't make me weak or lazy or someone who is blind to the opportunities of this lockdown. It makes me, me. A vulnerable person who is having a tough time dealing with this and is allowed to rest till I get back to some version of normal.\n\nIf you have felt anything like me at all, please know that it's more common than ever before. And it's okay for you to take a break and not feel guilty about it. A little bit of self compassion please. If you're able to do a lot in these times, you are an amazing person and I am proud of you. If you are just able to manage life one day at a time and somedays not even that, you are still amazing and I am still proud of you.

I want to know if their minds will be challenged rather than living in fear and worry all the time. \n \nIs our education system going on the right path?  And if it is, are the teachers going to lead this path to enlightenment for our kids to experience?\n\nI honestly hope so.\n \nIssues like these I tend to ponder about, and when they do arise I RESET and ask myself, \u201CWHAT WOULD I DO IF I HAD TO START FROM THE BEGINNING?\u201D\n\nHere are 14 things I\u2019d do 👇\n\n1️\u20E3 The human spirit needs to get fed.  Whether if it\u2019s reading a bible quote or verse, accumulate those words to heart and nurture it for your soul to grow.\n\n2️\u20E3 Develop a growth mindset.  Don\u2019t be afraid that if you don\u2019t have any talent, you\u2019re nothing in life.  Expand your thinking by having the passion to learn something new every day.  You\u2019ll be amazed on what you can do.\n\n3️\u20E3 Obtain a positive mentality always.  Remember, our kids are watching us during these tough times.  It is our duty that we stay positive no matter what.  Forget the negative feedback. \n\n4️\u20E3 Develop trust with someone that you strongly communicate with, whether for business or personal, and make sure you both have an understanding. \n\n5️\u20E3 Find your why! Your why will create that driven purpose in life which will then grow your passion to keep moving forward.  Remember it\u2019s the journey that counts the most. \n*read more👇👇","NumberOfLikes":7,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ʟɪFᴇ & ʀᴇᴛɪʀᴇᴍᴇɴᴛ | ᴀᴊᴏᴜᴀɴᴏ on July 14, 2020.

We managed it. \n\nWe, as in the whole family, went for a quick bike ride at lunchtime. We need to get better at finding routes with lesser crossings. Weekend plan - bike trail ✔.\n\nI did manage a couple of quick drawings of favourite characters for the kids memory\/inspiration wall. Although this time my mr 8 and miss 11 joined me and did their own drawings. Not complete yet, so will share when they are.\n\nAnd finally, we did complete the day 2 of step challenge and it was so much fun. We walked to the supermarket to get bread (and Nando's) lol just chicken..so was healthy!

Appreciate one another and most importantly ignore the negativity don't indulge into that try to be the bigger person which i know is hard sometimes when you just want to slap the hell out of someone 👋 but AVOID that 😂 \nMake time for yourself watch a good movie or a sitcom to uplift your mood or talk to a friend do what works for you.\nTry to give yourself at least one hour without your phone or laptop. Spend time with your family or go for a walk, exercise a bit or just meditate for some while. Having so much of screen time also adds on to the anxiety.

If I ask you to name the one thing that gives you chills, that instils a sense of fear in you, what would that be?\n\n \n\nMost of us have a hard time accepting that anything ever scares us. Mainly because fearlessness has been traditionally seen as a sign of strength. It\u2019s taken as a positive attribute. No one can be completely free from fear. It\u2019s a human emotion, like happiness, sadness, anger, grief, and others, fear forms a part of the family too. So how appropriate is our response to being asked if we are fearless? Or is the question in itself is inappropriate?\n\n \n\nIf you look back, we as a species have evolved only because we feared. We modified our coping mechanisms to deal with the changing exteriors. It\u2019s only because we accepted our fears, we chose to face them, and once we did, we figured our way out! Fear is what kept us alive, fear is what encouraged us to act out of the ordinary in extraordinary circumstances. So, if fear is one of the main reasons behind our existence, I wonder if the question should rather be, how fearful are you? Fearlessness is nothing but a degree of fearfulness in each one of us, it sure can vary from person to person, but it does exist in all of us!\nContinued in comments... \n\n#Day22 #lockdowndiaries #lockdownlearnings #lockdown #pandemic #corona #thistooshalpass #staysafe #stayindoors #bevigilant #fear #life #instadaily #takeresponsibility #fightback #evolve #shividoodle #doodle #writing #lovewriting #lovemore #onceawriteralwaysawriter #doodlethoughts #notexactlyrandomthoughts #newnormal","NumberOfLikes":32,"Hashtags":["#Day22","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdownlearnings","#lockdown","#pandemic","#corona","#thistooshalpass","#staysafe","#stayindoors","#bevigilant","#fear","#life","#instadaily","#takeresponsibility","#fightback","#evolve","#shividoodle","#doodle","#writing","#lovewriting","#lovemore","#onceawriteralwaysawriter","#doodlethoughts","#notexactlyrandomthoughts","#newnormal"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Shividoodle in Bangalore, India.

We know it. It's rocked the world over. Some days you may find yourself asking, \"When will things go back to normal?\" The loss of a sense of community and routine is irreplaceable, but that doesn't mean we have lost our ability to adapt.

Acceptance here doesn't mean giving in. On the contrary, it means that accepting the fact that things have changed, and instead of resisting, we let it flow over us and change ourselves according to it. It means that we take walks around the space in our house instead of going out, be our own baristas instead of ordering out, start-up a food blog instead of trying new restaurants. These \"new\" habits will take time to form, but when they're a part of your life, you will feel more in tune with yourself and in control of what is happening around you. \n.\n🔅𝔦𝔱'𝔰 𝔬𝔨𝔞𝔶 𝔱𝔬 𝔣𝔢𝔢𝔩 𝔲𝔭𝔰𝔢𝔱 𝔴𝔥𝔢𝔫 𝔱𝔥𝔦𝔫𝔤𝔰 𝔡𝔬𝔫'𝔱 𝔴𝔬𝔯𝔨 𝔬𝔲𝔱🔅\nIt's okay to feel negative. They are valid feelings. But do try to understand, if these responses are necessary for the event or if you need to shift your thoughts. Making time for yourself during the day will reduce any anxious feelings you have. You don't need to follow a rigid schedule. Some days can go good; others may be worse off. As long as there is something to keep you moving along, that is good enough. Lastly, build a strong community presence in your life by staying connected and in touch with people. You don't know how much you need it. This affects us all so we can only overcome this if\nwe come together.\n. \n🐈💌🙆🏽\u200D♀️","NumberOfLikes":15,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1594621983,"LocalDate":"Mon Jul 13 08:33:03 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"ollie_b84","CaptionText":"#quarantinelife #2020 #empties #lockdowndiaries #dedication #dicipline #gin #bombaysapphire #tanqueray #gordons #seagrams #glenfiddich #bartonsgin #johnnywalkerblack #evanwilliams #whiskey #bowmore #brokersgin #ketelone #vodka #pinckneybend  #chivasregal #josecuervo #oops #detoxtime #outofice #instagay #drinkresponsibly #lush","NumberOfLikes":127,"Hashtags":["#quarantinelife","#2020","#empties","#lockdowndiaries","#dedication","#dicipline","#gin","#bombaysapphire","#tanqueray","#gordons","#seagrams","#glenfiddich","#bartonsgin","#johnnywalkerblack","#evanwilliams","#whiskey","#bowmore","#brokersgin","#ketelone","#vodka","#pinckneybend","#chivasregal","#josecuervo","#oops","#detoxtime","#outofice","#instagay","#drinkresponsibly","#lush"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ollie on July 12, 2020.

Nachdem Chloe Alper und Jon Courtney auf dem Midsummer Prog Festival 2019 ihre Live-Rückkehr feierten, wartete man gespannt, ob sie auch auf Albumlänge zu alter Stärke zurückfinden würden. Und PRR liefern auf \"Eupnea\" ab. Alle Trademark-Sounds sind wieder mit an Bord.

Doch anstatt der üblichen Promo-Hektik, die eine neue Veröffentlichung mit sich bringt, stand die Welt um \"Every Bad\" plötzlich still. Für das Quartett sicher tragisch, doch dafür hatte man als Hörer wenigstens Zeit, sich völlig in die Musik der Britinnen fallen zu lassen. Depressionen, zerfallende Beziehungen, Langeweile \u2013 die Themen, um die sich die Songs drehen, sind plötzlich greifbarer als sonst, die Musik klingt inbrünstig und zornig.

Meditate: Meditation helps you to have control on your mind, It really helps me to manage my anxious and let me be more clear about the current situation. \n2. Listen to podcasts:  I didn't use to like podcasts, however having free time I started to listen podcast about my passions, and this really helps to develop projects; have knowledge about a topic you love, or just to empower yourself with positive advices.\n3. Read: Honestly, I don't like read but I found topics that I love and I feel so good when I'm reading about them; so find your fav subject and soak up that.\n4. Cook: I love cooking!!But if you don\u2019t like it, try different recipes either by your own or with your family, partner or friends. Have fun making pizza🥰, vegan dishes, cakes, BBQ ribs...\n5. Contact your loved ones: Call your family, friends or partner, talk about how you feel and ask how they are going as well. It\u2019s a way to not feel alone🖤\n6. Contact with nature: Walk out of your home and walk at least 10 in a park, lake or beach. Take fresh air and soak up the good energy of nature.\n7. Move and stretch your body: This does not mean that you have to do a training you dont enjoy, this means: move your body in the way you think it feels good like dancing, pilates, yoga, walking, cardio or just stretch your body at least 10 min a day. This is a powerful tool to feel good ,vital, and proud of yourself during this time.\n8. Make cool plans at home: Make different plans at home, picnic in the terrace, tacos 🌮or movie night🍿, spa day with your partner or by yourself 🧖🏽\u200D♀️, family board games or try a new makeup tutorial💄.\n9. Follow powerful accounts: Use better the social media to have some lightheartedness that helps you to maintain the positive thoughts; follow people that inspire you, that gives you good energy and good advices. This highly help me a lot!!\n\n#selflove #selfcare #selfesteem #helpingothers #freesoul #energyhealing #lockdown #lockdowndiaries #lockdownlife #quarentine #positivemindset #postivethoughts #adviceoftheday #blogger #alonetogether #intuitiveeating #guidance","NumberOfLikes":54,"Hashtags":["#selflove","#selfcare","#selfesteem","#helpingothers","#freesoul","#energyhealing","#lockdown","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdownlife","#quarentine","#positivemindset","#postivethoughts","#adviceoftheday","#blogger","#alonetogether","#intuitiveeating","#guidance"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1594606686,"LocalDate":"Mon Jul 13 04:18:06 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"themaidastouch","CaptionText":"\u201CEvery day is a good day.\u201D - zen koan.

For me lockdown commenced on 4th March. I was one of the very few that had the privilege of embracing this time to lay the foundations for the future of my business and being a helper to my near by family and at the same time having the love and support and a platform to enable me to move forward. Yes of course there were a few wobbly days and lots of inner reflection and inner deep consultations. Many of my friends and family were not so blessed and I did the best I could for all of them in the best way I can. In these times we adapted to a new strange way of being. But we knew as our support networks grew and friends we meet on social occasions became part of our inner circle ⭕️ that the new way was establishing itself and becoming the new reality. As we move now into the new reality I give thanks that I was one of the lucky ones that the virus so far has stayed away from our doors. Although I enjoyed my home and my lockdown life I now relish the new socialising eating out and catching up with my family and friends whatever the circumstances it\u2019s the love that prevails 🥰😍❤️#anitaflavin #al #alf #lucani #lockdownlife #newreality #londonlife #wesurvived","NumberOfLikes":57,"Hashtags":["#anitaflavin","#al","#alf","#lucani","#lockdownlife","#newreality","#londonlife","#wesurvived"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Anita Flavin in The Waterway.

Observing generation Y at home. \n.\nDapper young man Vedanta Thapar, first born scores 100 per cent in Maths in ISC boards. And because it's maths it's certainly commendable. \n.\nThrowback pic . Thank you @nashishsoni. Only you could have made the nerd living in track bottoms become so natty. \n.\nBoard scores today are largely unreal - humanities students score upto 99 per cent !! I get flummoxed.\n.\nVedanta lives and breathes for Physics which is pure poetry of the universe for him. Naturally board score is awesome (98 percent) but that's not the point given education system today. I have seen what anxiety does to this generation and our tireless efforts been to somehow help them enjoy the subject and balance the pressure. Is it hard ? Yes.\n.\nEveryone speaks of pressures of studies but what if they do have a passion for their chosen subjects ? That too has its challenges! To not become one dimensional. Vedanta eventually kept the balance with turning to badminton (played Nationals). Can't thank my husband enough for the commitment and ensuring he does not dive his nose deep only into his books in these formative years. \n.\nLockdown with the young man and his brother (age 15) kept me on my toes !Often cannot answer their rapid fire questions fast enough. As a parent I found myself constantly escaping to do research to brush up all things important on history and politics and try and keep up. Teachers are missed :)\n.\nI have learnt from my children observing how well they have coped (so far) with the pandemic world. Everyone has their moments but overall Vedanta room has been his sanctuary to just retreat into for indulging in his love for his subjects. He was suddenly liberated from the entrance exams looming large immediately after boards.\n.\nYes the coming year will be very hard for all college goers but till then there are small silver linings before everyone  gets on the treadmill again. May the growth of mind and spirit hold us in good stead. \n.\n\n#parenthood #LockdownDiaries","NumberOfLikes":173,"Hashtags":["#parenthood","#LockdownDiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Pareina Thapar on July 11, 2020.

The first day, it swooped down, flapped it's wings and pecked at my head, and followed me on the entire stretch of the road. While the other crows were calm. \nThe second morning it happened again. This time the crow followed me midway and then sat on this ominous looking tree with friends. (And, ofcourse Bambi chooses exactly that spot to do her business, which meant i had to stand there longer amongst them mad crows!)\n\nIt was scary ... My first thought was, perhaps the hair on my head resembled a bird's nest. Second thoughts rushed to the symbolic superstitions. \nSo far, I'm alive and kicking and life under lockdown isn't much mysterious or magical either! \n\nPS: Crows apparently hold onto grudges.\nNow i wonder, was i recognized as the one who stopped him\/her from pestering a chameleon the other morning?? 🤔🤔\n\n#lockdowndiaries \n#lockdown2020 \n#scary #crow\n#morning #walks #pets #birds\n#birdsofprey #superstition #crazy #incident","NumberOfLikes":16,"Hashtags":["#lockdowndiaries","#lockdown2020","#scary","#crow","#morning","#walks","#pets","#birds","#birdsofprey","#superstition","#crazy","#incident"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Rohini Bhowmick in Khewra Circle.

I\u2019ve made some major decisions, because I\u2019ve realised what\u2019s important in life (hugging my family and friends) I\u2019m actually grateful for lockdown for this and so much more.
