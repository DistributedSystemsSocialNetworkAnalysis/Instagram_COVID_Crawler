He says it is one of the most efficacious drugs he has ever seen in his lifetime and that it is extremely safe.  He also says that the war on the drug was merely a campaign to discredit President Trump.  In the middle of a pandemic, these political game, and the doctors who played it allowed tens of thousands of people to die, by not giving them a drug that works, that's safe, and that's cheap.

That includes participating in an open-mic poetry session 2 weeks ago during which I shared 3 poems. I didn't even tell anyone but my husband and my business wife @dragonfly62, and I told her AFTER the fact. It was just one of many things I've been doing lately JUST FOR ME. \n‚ñ° \nDuring that event, I had the honor of hearing the poetry of @iamkimbmiller. Please follow her if you don't already. She's an award-winning poet and the way she crafts words will make you smile, laugh, and think. Kim announced that she would be hosting a Haiku class coming up, so I hopped on it and signed up literally right after the open mic. \n‚ñ°\nTonight was our first class and I think this was one of the best decisions I made all year! I left feeling so inspired to create and write more...so heads up... more Haiku poems to come! (Even my husband laughed when he walked in and heard some of the poems being shared by Kim and others.) \n‚ñ°\nHere is one of 5 Haiku poems that I wrote during tonight's class. This is a non-traditional Haiku called a Senryu, which means that it's not about nature but rather human character. She told us not to explain our words, so I'm just dropping this here and hoping that it sinks in for some. üñ§üñ§üñ§\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#BmoreJanelle #BmorePoetic #poet #amwriting #vote #election2020 #COVID19\n#politics #racism #racisminamerica #americanhistory #pandemic #rockthevote #wearyourmask #explorepage #blavity #afrotech #sugarcanemagazine #Africandiaspora #rootsandculture #defpoetryjam #defpoetry #poetsofinstagram #poetrylover","NumberOfLikes":13,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1598239494,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 24 05:24:54 CEST 2020","Location":"Baltimore, Maryland"},{"CaptionText":"Tired of living from cheques to cheques ‚ùìlow on cash for bills , tuition,rents etc ‚ùì‚ùìfast and secure transaction üí≤üí∞üí∞instant payment‚úîÔ∏è serious client only!have your account ready üì≤üí±dm now !we all eat üí∞üí∞,tap in for info \n#therealkylesister #fitness #snapchatüëª #findom #Brooklyn #chicago #lasvagas #newyork #invest #workfromhome #covid-19 #pandemic #quarantine #uk #stayhome #cr7 #london #currency #Germany #tiktok #success #daytrader #wellsfargo #chime #investment #news #wealth #luxury #wallstreet #cnn","NumberOfLikes":4,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by terry kinor on August 23, 2020.

In their photography, there is a constant quest for the animal and it is an intimacy that is aspired to in every take.\n\nIn my work, I have mostly focused on animal activists to understand how it is that we think about the animal when we try to love them and do things for them. But I think photographers, especially of wildlife, have access to an intimacy that is perhaps even more primordial. In his exciting book, Akira Lippit offers a radical thesis which is that animals can be seen as the \u201Cpredecessors of photography\u201D which makes them such ideal subjects of photographs. Indeed, why do people love taking pictures of animals? Instagram is a treasure trove of wildllife photography and the devotion of these photographs which is much more than a penchant for collecting is worth studying...\n\nRead the full post here:  https:\/\/animalsinthepandemic.com\/2020\/08\/24\/the-tinsel-browns\/\n\n#antelope #deer #blackbuck #animal #animalsofindia #indiananimals #pandemic #animalsofinstagram","NumberOfLikes":5,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Animals In The Pandemic in Blackbuck National Park, Velavadar.

We start to forget, and determination can start to waver.\n\nThat\u2019s why ultra-runners often carry with them a little something to help them remember why they decided to do this run in the first place.\n\nWhen I showed up for my first ultra at the Big Red Run in 2017, I packed these 6 ziplocks for 6 days of attempting to cover 250 kilometres across the Simpson Desert. I had no idea what I had signed up for. But my intuition was telling me that I would need something on each day to help me hang on.\n\nAt one of the low points at Tahoe, just past Armstrong Pass, I read notes from Rohit @sunraina and Kat that Meg @mey.mey23 had dropped into my bag before the race. They got me going again when all I wanted to do was sleeping for weeks. On the final night heading towards the final checkpoint at Stephen Jones, I remembered a champion track runner talking about skipping when the body gets weary over 6-day championships. I started skipping and found joy again in running. I shared the exuberance with Jenna @jennabrook87 , to whom I had told the same story during her epic 4,500km Running4Bums journey across Australia. Our light banter got me through the fourth sleepless night. \n\nAt Delirious, running with my kind brother Andrew Westwick @andrew.westwick , as we stood on a high point waiting for the sun to set, the memories of my late brother became a source of strength.\n\nI have seen runners carrying photos of their children, partners and grandchildren in their chest.\n\nAs our esteemed Premier said, \u201C[The pandemic] is an ultra-marathon\u201D ü§î, we all know that life is not a sprint.

In the system, the say in decision-making is proportional to the impact on a person or group of people. Participatory economics is a form of¬†socialist¬†decentralized planned economy¬†involving the¬†common ownership¬†of the¬†means of production. It is a proposed alternative to contemporary¬†capitalism¬†and¬†centralized planning. This economic model is primarily associated with political theorist¬†Michael Albert¬†and economist¬†Robin Hahnel, who describe participatory economics as an¬†anarchist¬†economic vision.[1]\nThe underlying values that parecon seeks to implement are¬†equity,¬†solidarity, diversity,¬†workers' self-management, efficiency (defined as accomplishing goals without wasting valued assets) and¬†sustainability. The institutions of parecon include¬†workers'¬†and¬†consumers' councils¬†utilizing self-managerial methods for decision-making,¬†balanced job complexes,¬†remuneration¬†based on individual effort, and wide participatory planning.\nParticipatory politics¬†or¬†parpolity¬†is a theoretical political system proposed by¬†Stephen Shalom, professor of political science at¬†William Paterson University¬†in¬†New Jersey.\nIt was developed as a political vision to accompany¬†participatory economics¬†(parecon). Both parecon and parpolity together make up the¬†libertarian socialist¬†ideology of¬†participism; this has significantly informed the International Organization for a Participatory Society. \n\nSee more on our Facebook page: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/111480397190965\/posts\/163289105343427\/\n\n#socialism #indefenseofsocialism #humane #ecosocialism #politics #revolution #democraticsocialism #libertariansocialism #inclusivedemocracy #partcipatory #parecon #green #greenparty #HawkinsWalker2020 #progressive #Bernie #democrat #communism #anarchism #NoFascistUSA #fuckTrump #dumpTrump #OutNow #blacklivesmatter #coronavirus #pandemic #BidenHarris2020","NumberOfLikes":2,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598230598,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 24 02:56:38 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Above...snapshots from all various cities on August 22nd 2020.....So many serieses have already been & will be uploaded throughout the past\/next 24 hrs on @qnn_qanon_news_network...You are all heroes; for showing up, for sharing posts or even talking with friends and family about the real pandemic.

Key factors put with simplicity to help understand how things were already \"non-normal\" prior pandemic, and what to notice moving forward.\nKEY NOTES & INTERESTING FACTS:\n- In the previous history:\n a) debt was used toward investing to produce future growth and return, VS now went to buy back shares.\nb) debt to equity didn't surpass 30% where now went beyond 100% ! More debt was produced within the last 3 -4 months than the last decades.\n- (min 5.20) The Non essential parts of economics that had to shut down with pandemic, was the 80% of GDP. Non jobs related to physics, engineering, science.. yet lower income streams mainly, as tourism, hospitality, hotels, leisure etc.\nThose jobs designed to have lower wages for the majority of the masses, so even when unemployment rate was very low, there was not a significant impact on GDP\n- About half of American households had NO savings to cope with 3 months of lockdown\n- The application of the checks issued from government being very different than savings coming from normal wages ( money going toward rent, utilities, food, pharmaceuticals.. rather than toward entertainment and other non essential spending)\n- One of the main issues moving forward will be and is Economic Inequality\n.\nBonus point: I appreciated the point the interviewer made: as it happened for the 11th\/9 with terroris m attack, that saw then policies and operations significant changes (ex. with airlines..), this pandemic will welcome permanent changes to affect lives and businesses moving forward (i.e. in relation to hygiene standards, contact etc)\n.\nWelcome to surprise with a comment or quick opinion,as you read so far. Let's have a great day.. and stay mentally awake!

Within an hour of meeting, protesters began to push each other and throw objects. Some demonstrators on the pro-police side fired paintball guns and deployed pepper spray on counterdemonstrators. Other protesters used baseball bats. Many people wore helmets and body armor as they punched, kicked and tore at each other. Ahead of the weekend rallies, the FBI said it had received a bomb threat against federal buildings in Portland. The agency said it was still assessing the credibility of the threat Friday, and closed federal buildings through the weekend as a precaution.

This year with your children not having been in school since March, along with how different the upcoming school year is likely to be, their nervousness might be heightened. \u2063\n\u2063\nIt's entirely understandable, but the importance of having them feel comfortable expressing it and having you there to hold their hand and discuss it with them will help to dampen their nervousness.\u2063\n\u2063\nThe weekend provides an excellent opportunity to allow these conversations to occur. Start a chat with your kids about your own back-to-school experiences. Recognizing that you experienced what they might be thinking about, can lead them to share their nervousness while at the same time feeling that they own the conversation.\u2063\n\u2063\nThis will allow you to ease your children's nervousness about the upcoming school year by only using the relaxed setting it offers, along with casually sharing some of your similar experiences. This will allow you to be there for them, while at the same time making it easier for your children to adjust to the school year ahead.\u2063\n.\n\nEnjoy your weekend, ME time is a key component which allows you to be there for your children as you are each day.\n.\n#covid19 #mentalhealth #backtoschool #anxiety #children #parent #counseling #kidsmentalhealth #education #helpingchildren #therapy #stress #backtolearning #acquahcounseling #therapyforkidsandparents #weekendvibes #family #counselingforfamilies #pandemic2020 #pandemicparenting #pandemic #coronavirus #education #wellness #welbeing","NumberOfLikes":12,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Magdalene Acquah on August 21, 2020.

But browsing boldly through the #www led me to the largest #yoga #ashram outside India, the @yogavidya.de ashram in Bad Meinberg, Germany.\nSince yoga was what sparked my interest in freediving in the first place, spending time in #badmeinberg was a decision that came easily.\n.\nAfter my one-week stay, my impressions are nothing short of great. Of course, the accommodation was rather basic and I had to clean the room myself before I left. But I wouldn't have wanted it any other way. \nFor a week I was in this welcoming community of fellow travelers and #sevakas to learn and practice. Furthermore, the two #vegetarianmeals per day were super delicious.\n.\nThe range of lectures, workshops, and activities offered between 5 am and 10 pm every day was vast. Not everything might be everyone's cup of tea, but for me it was worthwhile to also have a look at additional topics such as drawing #mandalas and #energyhealing. After all, knowing whether something resonates with me is more than not knowing anything at all. By the way, I love the mandala I drew. ;)\n.\nAnd even if you don't fancy any specific activity at the ashram one day or another, the spa town Bad Meinberg or the #teutoburgforest at its doorstep might have something in store for you.","NumberOfLikes":5,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @skyfalke in Ashram  Bad Meinberg.

En el fondo, sab√≠a que yo era el √∫nico culpable. Siempre supe los minutos que deb√≠a consumir de internet (20 minutos aproximadamente), pero como aquello no me avisaba nada o simplemente no se cortaba el servicio, entonces segu√≠a utilizando todo lo que pod√≠a. Era como tener un arma en la mano y creyera que tuviera balas de mentira, pero al final ve√≠a todas las consecuencias despu√©s de haber \"disparado\" con un arma de verdad. \n\nHice la transferencia en seguida, para salir y olvidarme de aquello. No quer√≠a pensar que me hab√≠an \"vacunado\". Ten√≠a dinero, as√≠ que deb√≠a salir de ese problema antes de que pudiera crecer mucho m√°s. Tampoco quer√≠a pasar verg√ºenza por mi imprudencia. Sab√≠a que me hab√≠a hecho \"el we√≥n\". (Al comprar las bolsas, siempre estuvo detallado los minutos que deb√≠a utilizar de internet y las √∫nicas aplicaciones que deb√≠a usar).\n\nCuando me acerqu√© a Movistar de Curic√≥, antes de viajar a M√©xico, me explicaron todo lo relacionado con el servicio de \"Roaming\". El servicio costaba algo as√≠ como 40 mil pesos chilenos (50 d√≥lares aproximadamente), ¬°toda una semana! Pero como yo era un cliente de Movistar, ten√≠a derecho a utilizar una vez en el a√±o aquel servicio, pero despu√©s de la semana no hab√≠a de ser gratuito. As√≠ que me fui con toda la informaci√≥n necesaria, sin activar nada.\n\nNunca hab√≠a pagado tanto por una cuenta de celular. M√°s que enojarme, me burl√© de m√≠ mismo y me dije: \"eso te pasa por hacerte el we√≥n\". Le cont√© la an√©cdota a varios, y nos cagamos de la risa. Ya aprend√≠ que no hay que comprar bolsas de \"Roaming\". Puedes utilizar el Roaming autom√°tico que te regala la compa√±√≠a, pero en ning√∫n caso hay que pasar a comprar las bolsas.

In a bowl combine spinach, ricotta, Parmesan, egg, red chili flakes, 1\/2 teaspoon salt and pepper and mix.\n5. Place a piece of wax paper on the counter and lay out lasagna noodles and let them dry. \n6. Take about 1\/3 cup of ricotta mixture and spread evenly over noodle.

Cover baking dish with foil and bake for 30-40 minutes.\n8. To serve place lasagna roll on plate and add sauce on top. Or the other way around, your choice! \n9.

However this virus isn't the only thing which can have an adverse and harmful affect on one's mental and physical health as loneliness and social isolation also both play big roles. A solution to this can be having regular video or normal phone calls which are obviously less dangerous than meeting in person however if you do meet, ensure you take the proper measures to be as safe as possible. Some examples include washing your hands before the visit, practicing social distancing, wear masks while meeting and meeting outdoors while maintaining distance.\n#Staysafe #Stayhome \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#covid19 #Covid #lockdown #visitinfamily #pandemic #pandemic2020 #onlinecare #telehealth #telemedicine #telemedicina #stayathome #instadaily #instahealthy #coronavirus","NumberOfLikes":2,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by OnlineCare on August 23, 2020.

However, Fauci made clear that physically compromised people should not take the risk and should instead take advantage of absentee voting methods from home, \"I mean, obviously if you're a person who is compromised physically or otherwise, you don't want to take the chance.\u201D \n\nDuring the same interview, Dr. Fauci likened voting in-person this November to taking a trip to local grocery stores. He brought up the procedures taken by retail and grocery locations around the country to combat the coronavirus outbreak, \u201CFor example, you know, when you look at going to a grocery store now in many regions and counties and cities that are doing it correctly, they have X's every six or more feet. And it says, 'Don't leave this spot until the person in front of you left their spot.' And you can do that, if you go and wear a mask, if you observe the physical distancing, and don't have a crowded situation, there's no reason why you shouldn't be able to [vote in-person]\u201D.\n\nDr. Fauci\u2019s remarks seem to reprimand statements he made around April, where he stated he \u201Ccan\u2019t guarantee\u201D voting in the November election would be safe, countering the President\u2019s insistent remarks on how safe the Presidential election would be amidst the pandemic.","NumberOfLikes":50,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by No Cap News on August 23, 2020.

A lot of life changing events that have put to rest this traveling soul for a little bit have happened. However, I did have to get on a plane for an essential trip with my 7month old and wanted to share some tips that might help other mommas in the same position:\n1. Fly on a day of the week during a time it is complicated to most people. I chose a Tuesday at 9am. \n2. Choose an airline that is strict on Covid measures.\n3. Check seats periodically and change to an area of the plane you feel safe before checking in.\n4. Take hand sanitizer, clorox wipes and seat covers for extra safety. Wipe everything down before touching or seating.\n5. Plan your packing and carry ons to ensure little to no wait time in check-in counter and TSA. I recommend getting TSA pre-check.\n6. Eat a big breakfast and have no liquids since the night before to ensure no need to visit bathrooms or remove any masks for eating (this only applies to short travels). If absolutely necessary eat in the gate not the plane as well as use airport bathrooms and not the airplane.\n7. I used two masks a KN95 and a surgical on top in addition to a face shield. The extra protection gave me peace of mind.\n8. I chose the 9am flight to ensure it coincided with my baby\u2019s nap time. I made sure she stayed awake until boarding and then napped the whole flight under a cotton nursing cover. I never took her out of the cover.\n9. At the airports I kept her in a stroller covered with a plastic rain cover. \n10. I brought a pre-made bottle and gave it to her right before landing to ensure her ears didn\u2019t hurt. It was pre-made to ensure I didn\u2019t have to do anything in the airport and avoid contamination.\n11. We embarked and disembarked the airplane last to ensure we were alone at all times. We transferred the baby to the stroller upon disembarking (which we checked at the gate on a stroller bag to avoid contamination).\n12. Once we arrived at our destination we picked up our suitcases and left the airport. Before getting in the car we sprayed with alcohol all suitcases. We also threw away the masks and faceshields. üôå","NumberOfLikes":23,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by by LG on August 23, 2020.

I feel guilty for even saying that, because everyone is struggling, and if someone's not, they're probably an asshole.\n\nBut 2019 was supposed to be my bad year. 2019 is when I did the hard shit. I ended my marriage, I identified the abuse I endured, I dug deep into my own healing, I began a new and healthy relationship, I got a job, I put my kids in school and daycare, I found a new home, I finally approached polyamory on my own terms. I fought like hell to save myself and I barely made it. 2019 took everything I had.\n\nI made no resolutions for 2020. I intended to take this year at face value, to enjoy the life I tried so hard to get. At first, it seemed like that was really happening. My kids and I settled into normalcy. Our new apartment felt like home. I felt more confident at my new job. I met someone wonderful.\n\nYet this year keeps demanding more and more and I have nothing left. I am spent. The routine I fought so hard to establish for my family was shattered months ago with no return in sight. I'm back to being a stay at home parent half the time, which I hated before, and now I have a full time job on top of it. Soon my oldest will start all-online kindergarten, and I dropped out of early childhood ed after my first year of college. Meanwhile, the pandemic continues unchecked and no one really seems to care.\n\nMost days it's just too much.\n\nMy therapist tells me to do self care, but it's really hard to do that when the unknown threats that lie ahead loom over me constantly.\n\nOccasionally there are moments when I'm astonished that we're all supposed to carry on like this is normal. There's no relief, no assistance on its way, whether it's financial or emotional or practical. This capitalist hellscape proves once again that our lives are nothing, our physical health is nothing, and our emotional health is nothing, unless you can profit off of it.\n\n(Continued in comments ‚¨áÔ∏è)","NumberOfLikes":25,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Skylar Camp in Columbus, Ohio.

Then they quickly closed all gyms, hurting his fitness training business that he started back when our son was so young in Jan 2015. üí™üèæ Instead of laying down and accepting what is, he hit the pivot and started reaching out to all kinds of people we knew or met over the years. \n\nLong story short, he now 100% owns and operates a very successful landscaping company and I am not only able to help him on some projects, but I also do the invoices and estimates, using my background and degree. I have enjoyed being home with our 6 year old this summer and spent my early pregnancy in the comfort of our home. üè°\n\nI cannot thank God enough for this hardworking, gentle hero and his ability to never quit, give up, or walk away. His family comes first before anything and that alone is hard to find. His drive is contagious and I still learn so much about him every year. I certainly don't deserve him, but for whatever reason, he chose me to love and build a life with 11 years ago. üíï\n\nEvery industry he picks up, he excels in and we are truly blessed to be on this path together as a family. So for those who don't see him posting much, it isn't because he is doing nothing.

The year of 2020 has definitely been one heck of a ride. We started the year off partying on Koh Rong Island raising a glass to what should have been another year of long term travel. But how wrong was we? Three months into the year towards the end of our 10 week trip around Vietnam we had no choice but to fly home. We thought we would only be home for a few months and that we would be back on our way by October. But yet again, we was wrong. This year is flying by and everything is left uncertain.\u2063\n\u2063\nNobody can control what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s thrown me completely out of my comfort zone. Travel plans are ruined, time has gone to waste. The feeling of the unknown sometimes gets the better of me. But I am not going to let this get in the way of my dream. \u2063\n\u2063\nSo just a little reminder that sometimes things don\u2019t always go to plan.

It made me nostalgic for the days when we could eat in restaurants, shake hands to greet each other, and go to work or school without having to wear a mask, stay six feet away from each other, or slather ourselves in hand sanitizer. Whenever I go to a store and see everyone wearing masks, I feel sad about how quickly and drastically everything changed. I will never again take for granted the feeling of fresh air on my face. I wear the mask in public because I have to, but I hope someday to be free of the restrictions the pandemic has forced us to adhere to.

The coronavirus #pandemic itself. With more than 175,000 Americans already dead from the novel coronavirus, it is clear that anyone who goes to a polling place to cast his or her ballot in person risks becoming infected and possibly death. \n2. A sudden scarcity of polling places where it is actually possible to cast a ballot in person. The pandemic and the vulnerability of older polling staff provide perfect camouflage for drastically reducing the number of polling places and also for being highly selective in deciding where they should be located. \n3. Blocked access to voting by mail, the only option that would allow voters to cast their ballots without risk of catching the virus. \n \nRead today\u2019s Op-Ed on how these three elements could be used together to suppress votes. #votersuppression","NumberOfLikes":6,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by WhoWhatWhy on August 23, 2020.

My news director Kevin Finch was a huge race fan and he wanted every producer to truly understand how big the Indianapolis Motor Speedway was, so you understood what to expect from reporters and anchors. He scheduled a private tour of IMS and that tour birthed my love for racing. It was so cool to spend the month of May at IMS. I remember waking up at 4:30 a.m. to be on the grounds by 6 a.m. I loved talking to race fans, hanging out in the pit, gaseline ally, at the media center in the pagoda and so much more. \n\nFour years ago, I was able to convince my family to come to Indy for the 100th running. The trip was pretty last minute, so everybody stayed at our house.... most including Mike and I laid on the floor. Lol! It was a lot to get 21 people to the race, but I wanted everyone to experience the rush you feel when those race cars go flying by. \n\nI\u2019m so thankful that we made the sacrifice to come together four years ago, especially with no fans being allowed in IMS this year due to the pandemic. \n\nThe memories we made will never be forgotten.

Some decisions are highly motivated by loved ones' health risks; some are having to face the painful economic implications of quarantine life; some are managing very serious mental health and\/or PTSD symptoms as they don a mask or feel socially isolated; some simply have a different belief system because of other life experiences.\u2009\n\u2009\nSo how about we spread KINDNESS, not criticism? Take care of you and yours, and allow others to do the same in whatever way works best for them.

It can be hard enough trying to decide what to do let alone in a pandemic. \n-\n- \nAfter doing my A levels (Psychology, Travel & Tourism,  IT) I knew straight away that I was done with education. I had worked for what felt like my whole life in education, trying so hard with my school work and fitting into the mould that is the school system. \n\n-\n-\nSo I took a gap year. Worked in an office temporary job, alongside my job at Sainsburys. Quit Sainsburys to do my office job as my 9 - 5. The goal? To save up enough money to go travelling. A friend and I went to Thailand and working that boring 9 - 5 office job made me realise that Is not something I wanted to do in the future. When I got back I worked another office job at Easyjet - another insight into the type of job I didn not want to do, despite loving working in the travel sector. So whether your using your gap year to go travelling or try out different jobs there is not just one direction to achieveing your goals. \n-\n-\nWatch it now and let me know if it has helped you make your decision.\n#gapyear #pandemic #newnormal #studentgapyear #gapyearfriends #gapyeartravels #gapyear2020 #gapyearwork #gapyearvolunteering #cornagapyear #Covid19 #alevelresults #youtubechannel #howtovideos\n\n-","NumberOfLikes":4,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Edwards Tutoring on August 23, 2020.

It was my first time there. I have heard a lot about this beautiful Masuria, but it was always out of the way. However, the current pandemic situation has led to the fact that I finally decided to spend my vacation in Polish in Poland. No hotels or hostels, only open-air tent. Every day evenings spent with newly met people. Incredible closeness to nature, falling in love with the sup board, eating outdoors, experiencing the elements, forgetting about reality. Real Slow life...All this made me feel really happy. This vacation had a big impact on me, broadened my horizons, or rather my values.

I can\u2019t begin to guess how many will overtake our shelves in a year or two. But this clear-headed little book, written in the first few months of the lockdown, is a good start.\n\n.\n\nTITLE: Imitations\n\n.\n\nGENRE: Essays\n\n.\n\nSYNOPSIS: This slim collection of essays reflects on the disruptions to the ordinary course of live that coronavirus has caused, as well as the inequalities and societal problems that it has revealed. The essays are intimate and meditative in tone, with a range in topics and styles: one muses on the nature of time and the meanings and divisions we assign to it; another discusses death in American culture and how inequalities of race and class persist even in it; and another compares the contempt that too many people have for others to a different, more enduring disease. Mini-snapshots of life and people before and after lockdown offer a personal view of the effects of the pandemic. \n\n.\n\nTHOUGHTS: I enjoyed this book. At under 100 pages, it is short enough to read in one sitting, but it is precise and insightful enough to pack a lot between its covers. And it helps to make sense of the grand disaster this year has been. It isn\u2019t angry or accusatory, though it is willing to point out problems in American society, and it is honest about the pain this year has caused people. Smith offers a balanced perspective, both recognizing the real suffering and disruption almost everyone has felt, while pointing out that in many ways, those effects have been applied unequally across lines of race and class. She captures the different anxieties that have laid hold of people, as well as their varied responses to the sudden halt to ordinary life. As both a guide to and an artifact of this particular time period, her book is valuable.","NumberOfLikes":26,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Abigail | Fictitious Thoughts in Atlanta, Georgia with @penguinrandomhouse, and @penguinbooks.

What are the regulations or limitations in this new world?) our workshop is fully customized for the family and - while no one has all of the answers these days - we'd be working with as a team, advocating for them applicable, and will always be out front of the required information so that families stay in the know.\n\nThis workshop is four weeks long (one class per week, at time\/date of your choosing, with follow-up), instructor-led via live-stream (or phone call), and open-enrollment. We do not want to add strain in an already stressful time \u2013 we want to do the opposite \u2013 encouraging students and families to be confident in their next steps.\n\nThese seminars are individualized and customized so that you and your student can get as much value out of them as possible. The sessions focus on the particular needs, capacities, and interests of your student in order to answer questions, set a plan, and lower stress (all while preparing them for what comes next, even if it may be seemingly unknown at this time). It's our way of helping in any way that we can.\n\nIf this interests you and your family, let us know by sending a DM or an email to info@leonardandrew.com!\n\n#Tutor #tutoring  #focus  #admissions #studentathletes #athletes #college #collegeprep #studentathlete #athlete  #collegeadmissions #ncaa #learning #guidance #help #motivation #inspiration #morningmotivation  #workshops  #workshop  #showcase #pandemic #pandemiclife #covid19  #hereforyou  #collegelife #collegesports #educationalconsultant #educational #educationalconsulting","NumberOfLikes":7,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by LeonardAndrewED in Branford, Connecticut.

It seemed fitting to revisit today, the presumed 2020 Mont Tremblant Ironman race day, until the pandemic struck. We originally were registered for this year\u2019s  IMMT, then deferred to 2020 Ironman Maryland, which has also been cancelled. Although disappointing, I firmly believe there\u2019s no sense in stressing about things that you can\u2019t control \u2014 Sometimes, that\u2019s easier said than done. This pose is a reminder to myself to continue to reach upward and onward, with hope üí´ towards the future, instead of ruminating about what could have been.
