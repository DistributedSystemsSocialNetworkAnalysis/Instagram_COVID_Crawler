If you\u2019re feeling anxious, here are our top 3 tips on how to feel more calm and comfortable wearing one: \n.\n✏️ Practice wearing the mask for short periods somewhere you feel comfortable, more exposure may help you get used to wearing it. \n.\n✏️ Wear a mask that is comfortable and adjustable so that it fits properly around your face. It helps if it\u2019s a soft material too so that it feels nice around your skin. \n.\n✏️ Spray something that smells nice on your mask, or if using a reusable mask, wash it along with a nice fabric softener so that it has a comforting smell. \n.\n🌟 We recommend these reusable, adjustable, soft and stylish face masks from @sleepsmug that would be perfect to help you achieve all of the above recommendations. \n\n💖 Lastly, do remember some people with severe mental illnesses are exempt from wearing a mask if they find it unbearable. If you see someone who isn\u2019t wearing a mask, please be kind. We never know what is going on beneath the surface.\u201D\n\n#mentalhealth #facemask #anxiety","NumberOfLikes":59,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by SMUG. on August 19, 2020 tagging @mindsetmh.

That\u2019s when I fell in love with Little Women all over again, which then made it my favorite movie of all time. You see, the movie theater is therapy for me. If I\u2019m feeling sad, I\u2019ll see a sad movie so I can cry out my emotions by myself. If I\u2019m happy, I\u2019ll see a happy movie but also a sad movie because I love that (don\u2019t ask me why).

I ran every possible scenario in my head of what could go wrong. Within minutes i assemble multiple calls with high performing individuals.\n⠀\nThese were not calls to talk about fear, but more of executing and mastermind next steps.

This was crucial as there was so much uncertainty. Providing escrow extensions at no fees, accommodating leasebacks. This was the time to really think outside the box.⠀\n✅ Created more valuable content. More people stayed at home so they had more time to view what you do.⠀\n✅ Mastermind with individuals dominating their space.⠀\n✅ Expanded my network with other business. Working together and refer business.⠀\n✅ Focus on creating a POWER TEAM!⠀\n✅ Offer training to agents needing to create breakthroughs during the Pandemic.

Saying we are doing just fine, even when we're not, lines up with our country's indefatigable spirit. We are a nation of overcomers and go-getters\u2014people who suck it up and keep moving ahead.\n.\nIn this episode, @ErinStraza and @hannah_._anderson dig into their Getting By summer miniseries. Each episode of the series includes a special guest who has something specific to share about how we can get by in life considering the world as it is today. @wendyalsup joins this conversation to help us reconcile our current historical moment\u2014which is full of loss and fear\u2014with our tendency to sidestep pain and suffering. She is the author of Companions in Suffering: Comfort for Times of Loss and Loneliness (InterVarsity Press), which looks at the very normal occurrence of suffering in this life and offers a fresh perspective on how to walk through it. Counsel like this is so needed in this day, when we want to push away the pain and pretend that everything is fine. Wendy shares lessons she learned in her own suffering, pointing us to the God who chooses to suffer with us. If suffering is common and normal, why do we have such trouble walking through it? How does the prosperity gospel\u2014and the way it's baked into our country's culture\u2014exasperate our inability to suffer well? What does healthy suffering look like in daily life? Conversation touches on our perspective of suffering and how our faith can actually be strengthened when we learn to embrace it with God's help. Listen in for dialogue on questions like these as we learn how to get by together.

I have no issues with anyone who travels and I think staycations carry the same level of risk. Apparently foreign travel accounts for only 3 cases out of every 100 in Ireland. & the travel and hospitality industry needs help if it\u2019s going to survive. The issue lies in how you behave wherever you are.\n*\nNow, we 100% could have gone to Mykonos and avoided the party scene or another part of Greece. We have no doubts that the hotels in Greece are doing an amazing job at keeping everything safe and sterile. However, the chances we\u2019d have likely met someone who had met someone who had partied who had met somebody else who was potentially an asymptotic carrier were much higher than when we booked that trip 3 weeks ago. Avoiding COVID is extremely challenging, but we owe it to ourselves to at least try by following the guidelines that are set. That\u2019s all we can do and all that can be expected of someone.\n*\nSo, how can you travel safely and responsibly during the pandemic? I think it comes down to taking personal responsibility for your actions.\n*\nDo your research. In the lead up to our flight, we communicated with the hotels & people we knew there who were giving us their opinions. We were monitoring the numbers & CoVid Rate of our destination. We were mindful that Ireland\u2019s green list could change & UK were also monitoring their quarantine list, & we watched stories of other content creators already there to try & get a feel of what we were going to, some of which you can see in @agirlwhoblooms Greek highlights. In the end, it came down to the fact that we weren\u2019t comfortable going, which was why we cancelled the trip. We don\u2019t travel to party, we travel to do our jobs & we feel a sense of responsibility for anyone who chooses to follow us about the message we want to give you.\n*\n📸 by @agirlwhoblooms, edited by me.\n*\n#travel #covid19 #pandemic #greece #mykonos #travelblogger #iamtb #cntraveler #bbctravel #thismorning #thetravellingnomads #travelling #map_of_europe #iamtb #lonelyplanet #instagram #exploremore #explore #view #viewfordays #greekislands #europe","NumberOfLikes":261,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Joe in Mykonos with @skynews, @cntraveler, @bbc_travel, @irelandamvmtv, @gmb, @rtenews, @travelbloggeres, @travellingthroughtheworld, @map_of_europe, and @alifeiimagined.

Most people infected will experience a mild to moderate respiratory illness, whilst others will show no symptoms at all. However for some the effects are severe and longer lasting.\n\nOur aim in this yoga programme is to play some role in aiding the process of recovery. By only requiring the use of mostly basic props and furniture, we have tried to make the poses as accessible as possible for everyone.\n\nThe programme was compiled thanks to advice and guidance from Abhijata Iyengar, Lois Steinberg, Gulnaaz Dashti, Stephanie Quirk, the IY(UK) Therapy Committee, IY(UK) teachers who have experienced the virus themselves, and decades of work by BKS Iyengar and Dr Geeta S. Iyengar in medical classes at RIMYI in Pune.\n\nSee the link in our bio to access the video and booklet, which are both freely available. Please consider donating a contribution towards this and future Iyengar yoga therapy resources 🙏\n\nThanks to all involved in creating the programme and to @adrienne_karmaspaceyoga for designing the e-book\n\n#iyengaryoga #yogatherapy #covid19 #covid_19 #coronavirus #recovery #covidhelp #yogaforhealing #yoga #mypandemicsurvivalplan #sarscov2 #pandemic #pandemic2020 #staysafe #virus #postcovid #yogapractice #loveyoga #yogateachers  #iyengarmethod #yogadaily #practiceyoga #yogisofinstagram #yogajourney","NumberOfLikes":47,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Catalina Carreño Platz on August 19, 2020 tagging @iyengaryoga_uk.

The plan was never realized\u2014there was too much vested property interest. So the City of London to this day retains much of its medieval street layout, and many of its ancient street names. Listed they read like a kind of poetry: \nTurnagain Lane, Puddle Dock, Old Jewry, and New Change. Hanging Sword Alley, Undershaft, Muscovy Street, and Honey Lane. Amen Corner, Three Nun Court. Eastcheap, Cornhill, Poultry. \nFor more on this project follow me at @simonnorfolkstudio\n#pandemic #england #unitedkingdom  #epidemic #2020⠀\n⠀\n\n✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨\u2063\n\u2063\n #LovemarksEnCasa #QuedateEnCasa #Pymes #Emprendedores #MarketingDigital #CustomerExperiences #Panama #MarketingDigitalPanama #Marketing #MarketingPanama #ExperienciasLovemarks #locasxelmarketing","NumberOfLikes":9,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Marketing Rockstars in Panama City, Panama.

Apalagi, utilitas produksi pun sudah jauh dari kata normal.\n--\n\"Jauh ya, sekarang utilitas (tingkat pemanfaatan kapasitas produksi) 32%. Jadi yang masih jalan masih banyak tapi volume mengecil. Banyak yang lakukan 3 hari kerja, 2 hari libur, masih banyak seperti itu,\" jelasnya.\n--\nDi tengah kesulitan itu, Firman mengaku pelaku usaha butuh bantuan untuk lebih cepat pemulihan. Namun justru muncul sejumlah regulasi yang memberatkan.\n--\nRegulasi itu di antaranya adalah Peraturan Menteri Perdagangan (Permendag) Nomor 18 Tahun 2019 tentang Metode Pengujian, Tata Cara Pendaftaran, Pengawasan, Penghentian Kegiatan Perdagangan dan Penarikan Barang Terkait dengan Keamanan, Keselamatan, Kesehatan, dan Lingkungan Hidup (K3L).\n--\n\"Beredarnya produk ada izin edar. Kalau di Kemenkes ada BPOM, Kementerian Perindustrian ada SNI. Ini Kemendag keluarkan Permendag, ada syarat standar mutu lagi, sebenarnya itu duplikasi pengaturan, karena bicara standar mutu juga Ketika dilihat lebih dalam lagi sangat memberatkan. Masalahnya peraturan-peraturan ini ada tumpang tindih dalam pengawasan, jadi sewaktu-waktu bisa aparat hukum, selama ini kita harap pembinaan,\" katanya.\n-\n-\n-\n#rumahwarta #beritaterkini #beritaviral #updateinfo #indonesia #pabriksepatu #pandemic #covid19","NumberOfLikes":5,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by RUMAH WARTA on August 19, 2020.

Now, I\u2019m getting the chance to see Jon-Jon grow in front of my eyes, and I feel so grateful for every min I spend with him 🙏🙏.\n🌟I got a chance to change my lifestyle - do more exercises and lose all the weight I gained from pregnancy (I couldn\u2019t stop eating) 🥗🏃\u200D♀️. \n🌟I feel much more relaxed and much peaceful. Anyone who sees me these days will notice the difference (thanks to the Pilates) 🧘\u200D♀️. \n🌟I got the chance to spend much much more time with hubby and strengthen our family unit. Believe me this time is so precious 👨\u200D👩\u200D👦. \n🌟And last but not least, I learned to wake up every morning and say Thank You for everything I have in life.

E came with us. Z is too young to care and A touches too many things so it's risky. E umderstands that she needs to wear a mask and constantly use a sanitizer. Waisay toh even A understands this but it is also likely that she will lick the table and then touch everything and then her face also. So yeah. \n\nAnyway, I got scolded by my dad when he found out. That it is too risky and covid has not gone anywhere. I got asked by 2 other people why going was such an emergency and why couldn't we just wait for things to settle down more. To them I say this:\n\nIt was not urgent. It was not an emergency. It was just a much needed break. And wait till when? Things are not just going to settle down. We have passed a peak safely Alhamdulillah; I understand that lots have not been so lucky. But what I also see is that covid has hit people randomly. Not everyone who took proper precautions stayed safe and not everyone who was going around normally caught it. Further, the most we can do is wear our masks, wash our hands and avoid physical contact with people. I also understand that with the lockdown lifted the numbers might rise again. I might get some fun in before we hit another peak. \n\nWe are not being stupid. We are still being careful. I care about my kids more than anyone else would obviously. I know what's good for them. I know what will hurt them. I know where to be careful. We took them to Karachi Club , the tables were fairly distanced so it was fine. It was crazy crowded on the swings so we didnt let them go there although E was near tears when we told her it still wasnt safe. Nothing an icecream couldn't fix though. \n\nI know its dangerous. But it is also suffocating. And annoying. And unfair. And frustrating. And to each his own I say. \n\nSo for now, we will be careful. We will take care of SOPs. We will take our precautions. But we will also continue living our life.

We haven\u2019t seen eachother for 6 months now, as he is in Asia and I was in Europe and now the US. As with everyone around the world, our plans changed drastically since this past March. In 10 days we would have had our religious wedding in Greece. This #pandemic has been so difficult on many different levels. However, when it comes to us- what keeps us close together even though we are miles apart is the absolutely #love and respect that we have for one another. If I had any tips to give to new couples (and old) is that good and honest  communication, with no hints of jealousy or silly misunderstandings, can make a relationship flourish. Thomas and I have been together for 8 years, and all of them have been peaceful, loving and fun.

An amazing, monthslong rally has put the #sp500 back to where it was before the #coronavirus slammed the U.S, even though millions of workers are still getting #unemployment benefits and businesses continue to shutter across the country.\n\nThe S&P 500, which is the benchmark index for stock funds at the heart of many 401(k) accounts, ended Tuesday at 3,389.78, eclipsing the previous high set on Feb. 19 and erasing all of the 34% plunge from February into March in less time than it takes a baby to learn how to crawl.\n\nThe U.S. and global economies have shown some improvements since the spring, when business lockdowns were widespread, but they are nowhere close to fully healed. The number of virus cases continues to rise across much of the United\nStates, and federal and local politicians for the most part lack a strategy to contain it. Many industries, such as airlines, hotels and dining, could take years to recover from the damage.\n\nThe Federal Reserve and the U.S. government get a lot of the credit for the rally after pouring trillions of dollars into the economy.

The City\u2019s Outdoor Dining Program will utilize portions of the #public right of way to #support businesses, promote safe places and physical distancing, and activate our City\u2019s streetscapes. The City is #managing the program with support from the New Orleans Business Alliance (NOLABA). Overall, the City has committed $250,000 to the initiative.\n \nThe outdoor dining efforts launch today, Wednesday, Aug. 12, with a small #grant #program . Through this program, the City will give out $2,000 each to 50 restaurants operating outdoor dining areas in sidewalk cafe spaces or in off-street parking lots. Both of these #opportunities have been available to restaurants since the beginning of the #pandemic , and these smaller grants are an effort to support restaurants operating outdoor dining options. \n \nWithin a month, the City will launch a Curbside Dining and Parklets pilot, which will enable #restaurants within City-designated #corridors and districts throughout the city to expand their operations into the public, on-street parking spaces. The pilot will run for one month and enable the City to learn more about operating the new curbside dining and parklet permit program over the long term, as well as gather feedback from restaurants, #stakeholders and the general public.\n \nOnce the pilot concludes, the City will make the curbside dining and parklet permit available citywide and launch a second round of Outdoor Dining Grants. These grants will be up to $6,000 to support the construction of al fresco #curbside #dining and parklet areas.\n \nFor more information and to #apply, please visit outdoordiningnola.com.\n#neworleans #nolaisthemovement","NumberOfLikes":12,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Miller Enterprises74 in New Orleans, Louisiana.","NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1597838436,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 19 14:00:36 CEST 2020","Location":"New Orleans, Louisiana"},{"CaptionText":"Anuradha Chenoy writes.\n\nThe launch of the first fast-tracked COVID-19 vaccine by Russia, named Sputnik V, once again affirms the notion that muscular nationalism and militarism have been promoted over science and the public interest by many populist leaders during this pandemic.\n\nRussia has a tradition of wartime medicine testing on soldiers, pressurising students to join military medical institutions and combining all this with patriotism and scientific soft power. This modus operandi has been replicated during the outbreak of COVID-19 to link vaccine production to the military-industrial complex in Russia.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin is not the only one who has attempted to manipulate the dates of the vaccine launch \u2013 he succeeded owing to the overwhelming control he exercises over the Russian scientific community.\n\nFrom Trump to Bolsonaro to stalwarts of the Modi government, many have tried to push for a vaccine launch by a politically expedient date. Hence, Trump stated that the US would launch a vaccine before the presidential elections on November 3 even though pharmaceutical companies disputed the plausibility of the claim.\n\nIn India, the director of the highest body of medical research, the Indian Council of Medical Research, known to be a political appointee, declared that a COVID-19 vaccine made by India would be ready by August 15, 2020, India\u2019s independence day.

When I taught swim lessons something the little kids knew how to say and would say continuously was I can\u2019t.

Then I would make them swim and they did it even when they thought they couldn\u2019t. They felt empowered, they felt capable, and they felt reassured of their own capabilities and they knew someone believed they could even when they didn\u2019t. \nMost times we feel like we can\u2019t, we\u2019re tired, we\u2019re mentally and physically drained and we have a lack of fight left in us... pero we know that deep down we can still do it, we can still push through and do the damn thing.

Hell - we\u2019ve had a #PANDEMIC!\nBut Benn is absolutely right - being able to look up at this during those times reminds us of our #love for each other. It reminds us of that moment - that day that we connected to each other in love. Where we were, and how #grateful we are.\u201D\n⠀\n\u201CCreatively, after a while, you hit a point where things need to #change.\nThis is for the #business side of things too.\nBeing a #photographer, or in any creative role for that matter, is an ongoing process of reinvention.\u201D\n⠀\nI\u2019ve ALWAYS said that Benn Brown is literally the NICEST dude on the planet. If there was an award he would take it out, year after year; \u2018til death do us part.\n⠀\nSo when Benn, Jules and I caught up for some caffeine the other day, you could imagine my surprise when he claimed that when he started photographing weddings all those 12 years ago, he was scared of people!\n⠀\nJules and I tried to call BS on him \u2026 but he wasn\u2019t having a bar of it.\n⠀\nHe explained, \u201CBecoming a #wedding photographer wasn\u2019t my initial intention. I was an underwater dive photographer and loved shooting #landscapes, the #reef and #marine life. That\u2019s where I saw things headed.\u201D\n⠀\n\u201CI clearly remember on my first day as a dive instructor, having to tell a large crowd of people on the boat where the trash can was, and I even managed to mess that up.\u201D\n⠀\nBenn agrees that 80% of being a wedding photographer is crowd control. And what better way to learn that, than underwater in #scuba dive gear, communicating with a crowd of people using your hands.\n⠀\n⠀\nRead more of this inspiring couple's story on the @albumregistry blog.\nLink in bio.👆","NumberOfLikes":2,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Album Registry in Blue Sky Photography with @bennpics, and @blueskyphotographyqld.

Here\u2019s an excerpt from a guide for parents looking to support the mental health of their older teens. (The entire article is available at khaleejtimes.com\/wknd, link in bio.)\n\n***\nEncourage self-discovery and self-development in your teenager. It is good to be involved in your teen's life but striking the balance between encouraging their autonomy as well as continuing to encourage interdependence with the family system is equally important.\n\nUnderstand that your teenager is not yet a fully-fledged adult but is likely to be grappling with issues that come up during adolescence - such as needing to fit in, experimenting with increasing autonomy and risk-taking, and making sense of their social worlds.\n\nEncourage them to build resilience during uncertain times. A prevailing sense of uncertainty during the current pandemic has meant that they have not only had to adapt to new ways of learning, socialising and just being, but they might also be fearful about their future. It can be comforting for older teenagers to know that they have the continued backing of their parents, no matter what happens.\n\nBe aware of your expectations. If your teenager wishes to explore a less travelled avenue, help them by investigating the pros and cons of this and, where possible, find ways to support their curiosity - whilst also offering them realistic advice about a path that will be sustainable for them in the long run.\n\nStrike a balance between advising and lecturing. Offering guidance and support with warmth and compassion can help your relationship with your older teen. On the other hand, being overly critical of their life choices, decisions and preferences can be damaging to their sense of self-worth and esteem.\n\n***\n#mentalhealth #parent #parents #parenting #teen #teenager #adolescents #children #father #mother #family #relationships #calm #breathe #anxiety #depression #selfworth #selfesteem #covid19 #covid #pandemic #virus #corona #coronavirus #newnormal #socialdistancing #reesewitherspoon #reese #witherspoon #deaconphillippe","NumberOfLikes":10,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by WKND on August 19, 2020 tagging @mommyandyoyoplusmeera, @mom_in_dubai, @momindxb, @mumma_dubai, @mommyindubaivienna, @mompreneursww, @mommyzdiaries, @allaboutmommyandzayed, @uae.moms, @uaemombloggers, @mom_foodie, @mom.at.dxb, @mommybabydrama, and @mom.in.progress.dxb.

Given its importance and the fact that social interactions generally have to occur via #technology during the #pandemic, there are some important considerations for managers of homeworkers:⠀\n⠀\n- Ensure each employee is part of a smaller network. Research highlights that homeworkers develop a close network of colleagues who become their \u2018go to\u2019 people when needing support with their work or for general social interaction. Ensuring everyone is part of a smaller network can ensure that no-one is struggling alone, helps develop a group bond and encourages more open communication.⠀\n⠀\n- Encourage social interactions to take place. This may include finishing work early on a Friday, as is common practice in some organisations, and spending an hour on a video call with colleagues. When a standard #communication norm is shared with all employees within an organisation, more are likely to partake knowing that they are free from #work for that period.\"⠀\n⠀\n#SMEs #business #management #WednesdayWisdom #WednesdayMotivation","NumberOfLikes":6,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by BedsBiz on August 19, 2020.

Since record \r\nkeeping began in 1947, quarterly GDP had never exceeded even a 3% drop (non-annualized). Here \r\nare just a few of the problems currently plaguing the economy:\r\nEmployment: Well over 50 million people are still out of the workforce as businesses shutter \r\npermanently and restrictions continue in many parts of the country. New unemployment claims \r\nhave now exceeded 1 million for 19 consecutive weeks.\r\nConsumer Spending: This makes up more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy, and it sank by the \r\nsharpest rate in April\u2014declining by 12.6%. The weekly payments of $600 provided through \r\nthe CARES Act helped bolster household income, partially offsetting steeper losses. However, the \r\npayments expired July 31, and may not be renewed as an initiative.\r\nMonetary Policy: Trillions of dollars have been borrowed to counter the crisis, money supply (M2) \r\nhas rapidly risen, and central bank balance sheets are shattering records. Despite the injection of \r\nmoney into the system, inflation has dropped to almost zero\u2013well below the Fed\u2019s ideal 2% rate\u2013\r\nsignaling deflationary pressure on the economy.\r\nDespite the significant challenges facing the American economy, there are some areas that are \r\nshowing signs of recovery.\r\nS&P 500: The flagship index is the most prominent positive, recording its best quarter in over two \r\ndecades. Reaching a high-water mark in June, the index shot up over 25% over the second quarter. \r\nFederal stimulus packages stoked optimism in the markets, with the Fed at one point \r\npurchasing $41 billion in financial assets daily.\r\nPurchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI): Widely seen as a leading business indicator, the PMI is also \r\nrebounding. Manufacturing output stabilized as production facilities slowly reopened. As a result, \r\nan expansionary manufacturing cycle is anticipated to begin.\r\nBig Tech: Business is booming for Big Tech in the latest quarter. Amazon\u2019s earnings doubled \r\ncompared to last year, while both Facebook and Apple witnessed double-digit earnings jumps.","NumberOfLikes":25,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1597830672,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 19 11:51:12 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"The Pandemic Traveler\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#traveler #pandemic #iso200 #canonphotography #canones","NumberOfLikes":12,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Marc Ripoll on August 19, 2020.

By the third week, three of the district\u2019s high schools had temporarily reverted to all-online learning. Schools in Mississippi, Tennessee, Nebraska and other states also reported multiple cases, quarantines and temporary school closures.\n\nDeciding whether to open schools for in-person classes during a pandemic is a complex decision. Children often learn better in school, where they have direct contact with expert teachers and the social-emotional learning that comes from being around other children. But they also risk spreading the disease to their teachers and one another\u2019s families without even being aware they have it.\nContinue Reading\n.\nhttps:\/\/aspioneer.com\/children-are-big-spreaders-of-coronavirus-heres-how-schools-can-lower-the-risk\/\n.\n#aspioneer\n#coronavirus\n#COVID #education #health #onlinelearning #pandemic #school #science #socialdistancing #teaching #virtuallearning","NumberOfLikes":39,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Aspioneer on August 19, 2020.

So don\u2019t put your #investment decisions and financial planning on hold just to wait for the situation to become normal.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has brought the world to a standstill. Probably, this is one of the biggest crises in the last 75 years. However, the pandemic is temporary and most of us are going to sail through this tough time.

A crisis like this can keep people out of the job #market for a very long time and also bring unexpected large medical expenditures. We should be prepared for the worst and make the necessary arrangements to make sure we get to live our normal life.\n\nHaving an emergency fund of at least two years of expenditure could give us adequate protection to fight any future unforeseen circumstances.

If it\u2019s family insurance then coverage definitely needs to be higher than Rs 5 lakh. Investors should consider having low-cost top-up insurance to increase the coverage amount. Further, adequate term insurance for the main earning member of the family is necessary.\n\n𝐑𝐞𝐯𝐢𝐬𝐢𝐭 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐟𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐠𝐨𝐚𝐥𝐬\n\nTraveling and large social gatherings are two things that are stopped due to this crisis.

Country music runs deep in my veins, having been brought up on it via my parents and grandparents, however I briefly shied away from my love of country during my early teens and boarding school life ( Country was deemed daggy and you were terribly \u201CUn-Cool\u201D if you liked it ). Rediscovering my love for Dolly again at 16, Songs like \u201CCoat Of Many Colours\u201D, \u201CHere You Come Again\u201D and \u201CShattered Image\u201D remain some of my favourites, her incredible song writing skills and Smokey Mountain, Songbird sweetness, providing me with a lifelong soundtrack. Her music has gotten me through some sad times ( \u201CWildflowers \u201C ), and some happy times ( \u201CBaby I\u2019m Burning ), somehow her voice always makes me feel good, especially during this whole Covid-19, stage 4 lockdown, pandemic mess! Helping me cope with feelings of homesickness and a yearning for the life of that young innocent, carefree child from the bush, Dollys voice is particularly soothing at the moment. So naturally my obsessions this week have turned to the original \u201CDumb Blonde\u201D, and some of my favourite images of her over the decades.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#dollyparton#icon#legend#idol#queenofcountry#countrymusic#tibooburra#brokenhill#outback#australia#bushkid#joelene #coatofmanycolors #shatteredimage#hereyoucomeagain#tieourloveinadoubleknot #9to5 #the_bearded_blogger_2obsessions #covid19 #pandemic#lockdown#babyimburnin","NumberOfLikes":8,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by the_bearded_blogger_2 on August 18, 2020 tagging @dollyparton.

Selain itu kita bisa paham dengan konsep kehidupan dan bidang lainnya. Apalagi dalil menuntut ilmu sudah tertera dalam Al Quran dan hadist. Allah SWT menyeru menuntut ilmu bukan semata-mata untuk kebaikan di dunia, tetapi bekal hingga akhirat. Terdapat juga keutamaan menuntut ilmu selain bisa menaikkan derajat mereka, Nabi shallallahu \u2018alaihi wa sallam bersabda,\n\n\u201CBarang siapa yang menempuh perjalanan untuk mencari ilmu, maka akan Allah mudahkan jalannya menuju surga.\u201D (HR. Muslim).\n\nMenuntut ilmu tidak hanya terbatas pada hal-hal ke akhiratan saja, tetapi juga tentang keduniaan. Jelaslah kunci utama keberhasilan dan kebahagiaan, baik di dunia maupun di akhirat adalah ilmu. Rasulullah SAW pernah bersabda:\n\n\u201CBarangsiapa menghendaki kehidupan dunia maka dengan ilmu, dan barangsiapa yang menghendaki kehidupan akhirat maka dengan ilmu, dan barangsiapa yang menghendaki keduanya (kehidupan dunia dan akhirat) maka dengan ilmu.\u201D\n\nsource : umma.id\n\n#sentuhanparenting #parenting #orangtua #kebaikan #amalsholeh #ikhtiar #alirsyaddakwah #masjidalirsyadsurabaya #kajian #kajianIslami #tazkiyataunnafs #islam #sunnah #quoteislami #motivasi #renungan #coronavirus #covid19 #pandemic #masjid #alirsyad #surabaya #adab #turkish #lebanon #hagiasophia #tilawah #quran #ilmuislam","NumberOfLikes":46,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Masjid Al-Irsyad Surabaya on August 18, 2020.
