Welcome to the new world, the DIGITAL WORLD!\n...............................................\nIn July 2019 I began a new journey of learning the skillset of currency trading. My intuition was telling me to leave my government job of 9 years where I was so comfortable and I fought the voice over and over. Finally in November I turned in my resignation letter to my manager 3 times 🥺. By February, I realized that staying home to be a full time entrepreneur was no joke. I had to make my own schedule and stick to it 🙄 no boss to help me stay on task, this required a lot of discipline that I was not used to. So, I panicked and quickly accepted a travel assignment and quit my \u201Cnew journey\u201D! \n...............................................\nWhile on my travel assignment, something named #CORONAVIRUS took the world by storm. Gloves, gowns, and masks that were readily available on our unit were removed and placed under lock and key unless we had a rule out covid19 patient 🤯. In that moment I realized the voice that I heard in November was God preparing me for this #PANDEMIC 😳. Luckily I only had two more weeks left in my contract. The dysfunction of the government and hospital with the PPE shortage made me realize the safest place to be was home with my family.\n...............................................\nIn April I joined a retired Registered Nurse, master day trader\u2019s mentorship and this decision has blessed my life more than any JOB ever could! I now have the #FREEDOM to stay home with my family. I now can turn down job offers. I now have acquired a skillset that I can pass down to my children and impact the lives of so many. Don\u2019t get me wrong I love #NURSING but I want to do it on my own terms.\n..................................................\nToday at 7PM, 8PM, or 9 PM you too can have the opportunity to meet my 7 figure, retired RN mentor and LEARN how you can live life on your terms.

Most of them were younger than 30 years. The latest addition to this unfortunate list was Mohit Singhla, a research officer in the paediatrics department of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi \u2013 the third doctor to have died thus at this hospital in this period.\n\nSuicide among doctors is a complex, multi-factoral issue that has been plaguing the country for decades now. Studies from across the world indicate that suicide rates among doctors are higher than in the general population. According to the 2019 World Health Statistics, there are 10.6 suicides per one lakh people every year, although in India there are 16.3. And while studies that compare suicide rates among doctors with that of the general population in India are lacking, \u201Cthere is no reason why it should be any different,\u201D Soumitra Pathare, director of the Centre for Mental Health Law and Policy, Pune, told The Wire Science.\n\n\u201CWhen I went to medical school in Mumbai in the 1980s, each batch would graduate with one or two student suicides during the five-year course. Very exceptional batches, maybe one in five or six batches, would have no suicides,\u201D he added.

I\u2019m there for everyone, but who is there for me? I say this knowing that if I were to say this to any of my friends they would feel terrible and ask what they could do to help me, but I\u2019m not sure I have an answer for them.

And Haʹdes was closely following him. And authority was given them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with a long sword and with food shortage and with deadly plague and by the wild beasts of the earth.\n\n🕊 2 Timothy 3:1\nBut know this, that in the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here.\n\n🕊 Matthew 24:3\nWhile he was sitting upon the Mount of Olives, the disciples approached him privately, saying: \u201CTell us, When will these things be, and what will be the sign of your presence and of the conclusion of the system of things?\u201D\n\n🕊 2 Corinthians 6:2\nFor he says: \u201CIn an acceptable time I heard you, and in a day of salvation I helped you.\u201D Look!

Actions are taking place across Canada on August 23 to demand #StatusForAll. See the Migrant Rights Network account for details.\n\nWhat do #MigrantsRights have to do with #ClimateAction? \nOne thing I've noticed about the #ClimateCrisis #CarbonReduction conversation is a separation between us, people, from the concept of saving #ecosystems, #NaturalEnvironments, and the planet in general. Yes, cutting emissions is definitely about us, our depletion of resources, and whether our actions help or not. But the way these conversations run has suggested to me that humans are the \"controllers\" of resources and everything else is the \"environment\" that we are fighting for. (And there is a whole conversation to be had about which humans are seen to been in control, to have the right to control.)\n\nPut plainly, we cannot fight to clean up the oceans, and not fight for fair income for migrants; we cannot fight for endangered species and neglect to speak up for migrants' access to health care; etc.\n\nThe environment includes us and our relationships with communities with whom we co-exist. During this #pandemic, many of us have relied on the labour provided by migrants who have kept us safe, fed, mobile, healthy. And yet, too many still do not have access to the very essentials that they provide us. See @migrantrightsca for some compelling examples.\n\nThere is no time like the present to listen carefully to #ClimateConversations and pay attention to what is being left out.\n\n#AntiRacism #Immigration #MigrantJustice #EnvironmentalRacism #myrtw #JustRecovery #ClimateJustice","NumberOfLikes":14,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by 🌐 climatepledgecollective.org on August 18, 2020.

I have a gift \u2014 I\u2019m able to fall asleep in any place, in any position. But lately, my sleep and I have been in a rough patch. No coincidence that my troubles began right when our world started shifting as the pandemic hit\n\nI\u2019ve tried juuust about everything when it comes to getting some 💤 and I\u2019m happy to report that it IS getting better. Slowly but surely with the practice of consistent sleep hygiene and a lil help now and then, me and the love of my life (my bed) are on better terms. Somethings you should try if you\u2019re in the same boat:\n\n🌚 weighted blanket. Mine is @mybearaby and it\u2019s made with 100 cotton, heavy as hell and puts me to sleep right away. I love being bundled up when I sleep and this thing is like a big hug!\n🌚 a fan. It\u2019s simple, and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the constant breeze that makes me feel like I\u2019m ocean-side or the white noise that helps but I\u2019ll take it!\n🌚 lavender. Essential oil diffuser or rubbing a lavender scented balm like @badgerbalm on before you hit the sheets helps relax muscles and mind and clear away tension\n🌚 cbd + melatonin. @highlinewellness gummies have CHANGED the game for me. Before them, I was taking ibuprofen PM and would wake up feeling so groggy and slow. The highline gummies chill you out and put you in the perfect sleep zone. I can feel my eyes start to get heavy and then my whole body follows. No groggy or hangover feeling the next day at all\n🌚 weed. I don\u2019t talk about it much on here cause frankly, it\u2019s not legal here in MN yet, but when I\u2019m having really bad headaches or feeling super restless or sore, I call in the big guns. I have a @__kinoko____ nighttime THC tea that I lurrv!\n🌚 the obvious sleep hygiene routine of no TV or phone in bed, a dark bedroom and going to bed around the same time each night.

It's embraced by Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson and #MyPillow founder and CEO Mike Lindell, a big Trump backer, who recently took a financial stake in the company that develops the product.\n_\n°Lindell told Axios that in the meeting, Trump \"basically said: \u2026'The FDA should be approving it.'\"\n\n°The White House did not respond to requests for comment.\n_\nWhy it matters: A senior administration official familiar with the internal conversations told Axios, \"The involvement of the Secretary of HUD and MyPillow.com in pushing a dubious product at the highest levels should give Americans no comfort at night about their health and safety during a raging #pandemic.\"\n_\nThe big picture: It's part of a pattern in which entrepreneurs, often without rigorous vetting, push unproven products to Trump \u2014 knowing their sales pitches might catch his eye. Trump will then urge FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn to \"look at\" or speed up approval.\n_\nIn March, Trump personally lobbied Hahn to authorize hydroxychloroquine's emergency use to treat #COVID-19.\nThe FDA obliged. But in June, after a large trial, the agency revoked that authorization and warned of the \"risk of heart rhythm problems\" in COVID-19 patients treated with the drug.\n_\nBehind the scenes: Senior administration officials familiar with the internal conversations around #oleandrin have raised concerns about the way this botanical extract \u2014 pushed by Andrew Whitney of Phoenix Biotechnology \u2014 is being promoted at the highest levels of the #Trump administration.\n_\nThere is no public data showing oleandrin has ever been tested in #animals or humans for its efficacy.\n\nRepost from @occupydemocrats \nVideo by @briantylercohen","NumberOfLikes":22,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":11,"Timestamp":1597799198,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 19 03:06:38 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"-\n방구석에서 혼자 노는 사람이 살아남는 세상😇\n광훈이 덕분에 주말에 여자도 못 만나고 이게 뭔가...😩\n쟤네들 덕분에 정신머리 제대로 박혀있는 기독교인들도 싸잡혀서 개독교라고 욕 먹는거여.\n나라에서 하지 말라면 좀 하지 마라 제발🙏\n33도에 마스크쓰고 걸어서 출퇴근하는 사람은 1도 관심없는 종자들...\n사이좋게 손 잡고 그렇게 좋아하는 천국들 가세요 부디🙏\n북한 소행 테러라는 말 보고 진짜🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣\n국가가 하지 말라는거 골라서 하는게 진짜 테러 아닌가🤔?\n테넷도 개봉 취소되면 진짜...😫\n-\n#코로나 #확진자 #하루에 #279명\n#전광훈 #사회적거리두기 \n#펜데믹 #covid19 \n#교회 #기독교 #개독교 #북한\n#pandemic #주여 #오직예수 #불신지옥","NumberOfLikes":16,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ɴ ᴏ ɢ ᴜ ɴ on August 18, 2020.","NumberOfComments":10,"Timestamp":1597799033,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 19 03:03:53 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Culturally Active:\n.\n\"Prevenir é melhor do que remediar.\" \n.\nSim, essa é a expressão correspondente em Língua Portuguesa.

I would rather prevent it than cure it. \n.\nOutras expressões com o mesmo sentido:\n- Better to be safe than sorry.\n- Prevent it than cure it. \n.\nOrigem\nO provérbio \"prevention is better than cure\" significa que é sensato impedir que uma coisa ruim ou uma doença aconteça do que ter que lidar com consequências terríveis, como problemas de saúde ou danos mais tarde.

He had students, he had tenure, he was healthy, handsome, eloquent, and he was lonely.\n\nIn a Facebook post, he wrote his final note: \u201CIt is not good for the man to be alone; loneliness kills. Another day, another week, another month, another year goes by and I\u2019m alone. At lunch, at work, in the evening, on weekends, on holidays, and on birthdays that no one remembers. The few friends have gone, faded in time; it is time to leave.\u201D\nThat man was not unique in his emotions. His words on social media capture the curse of our time: We are all connected, yet so alone. Loneliness has become so heavy these days precisely because we should have been so much more connected than we are.\n\n\u201CThe loneliness so many feel today is not the end. It\u2019s the beginning. It\u2019s the darkness before the dawn. Now we are beginning to realize that we must transform everything, and first and foremost our relationships. To make a change, we have to feel that the present is unbearable. And nothing is more unbearable than loneliness.\u201D\n\nWe\u2019re so late in our development. By now, we should have been a connected humanity that feels that we are one system whose parts complement each other and reciprocate with one another for the sake of humankind and all of nature.

Even when you hardly get to follow it much at all, you still know you accomplished SO much more than if you didn\u2019t make a schedule or a plan in the first place.\n🌽\nMy perfect plans is to workout 5 days\/week but I know that I will most likely only get in 4 days because life HAPPENS. Even if I only get in 3, I try reallyyyy hard not to beat myself up about it cuz that doesn\u2019t lead to success, that leads to giving up due to shame\/a lack of confidence.\n🌽\nNot measuring up to a perfect plan doesn\u2019t mean failure. Giving up does.","NumberOfLikes":81,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1597796557,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 19 02:22:37 CEST 2020","Location":"Sacramento, California"},{"CaptionText":"Today\u2019s repost is from @mvmtnotmoment who creates stunningly gorgeous illustrations to inform and spread awareness 👏\n\u2022\nThis!!!!

The blood vessels leading to the higher reasoning part of your brain constrict. The body is starting to act as if you are under physical attack. You don\u2019t need the higher reasoning part of your brain functioning under such a threat. At least that is what the body thinks. So we are left with a very ancient part of the brain which is an all or nothing, survivalist part of us. Everything becomes super dramatic, and it feels like the end of the world. It is in these moments that we need to soothe ourselves and bring ourselves back to earth, so that we can think things through and ensure that we are connected to our heart, our intellectual capacity and our emotional intelligence. Sometimes that means that you need to take a bit of a holiday, or scale back on your work, or somehow slow things down so that your body can catch up and realize that you\u2019re not actually under physical attack.

It taught us how important family and friends are. It taught us how boring our life would be if we always stay home. It taught us how important work and studies are. It taught us that all friends matter alot to us. This situation told us that there's a extrovert, hidden in all introverts. It taught us that taking break from life is good but if this break ends for too long it can make you sad and depressed. This situation made us realise that there's much more to life than being connected on social sites. Our life is all about being with friends and family, It's all about meeting new people, experiencing new things, exploring yourself, laughing out loud when with your friends, those quick hugs and handshakes. It's all about feeling grateful for those little things you have been blessed with. It's all about cheering every situation in your life. It's about feeling all the emotions to their fullest. It's about fighting to your friend on useless thing and after a minute hugging and laughing with same friend.

A mask that presses against the face can\u2019t be tolerated for long hours, lips and nose will become irritated and breakdown. Maskne is a real thing, bacteria will grow like crazy in a warm moist area. \nMy pic without the mask shows how moist my face is after removing, I use a little trick of folding a tissue to about a 2\u201D by 4\u201D to tuck in my mask right under my chin to absorb excess wetness. \n\nI have narrowed it down to 2 brands of masks, VS PINK is my favorite and most comfortable, makes sense that a bra maker designed a \u201Cface bra\u201D\nThis one by far is the most \u201Cbreathable. \n\nMy 2 favorite is from my favorite gym wear company Live Sore, great comfort, great material for wicking moisture. \n\nNo sore ears from either of these brands. \n\nMy secret to preserving skin is changing my mask every 2 hours, the biggest mistake you can make is wearing the same mask all day, and wash them often. \n\nHopefully this helps someone. 😷 #masklife #pandemic #essentialworkers #maskwearing #masktipsandtricks #maskadvice #wearingafacemask #maskneprevention #vspink #vspinkfacemask #livesorefacemask #livesore #shelifts","NumberOfLikes":57,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597792360,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 19 01:12:40 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"BET COVID-19 Relief Effort \n#SavingOurselves\n#BETCovidRelief \n#BET\n#BETMUSIC\n#Covid19\n#Corona \n#Pandemic","NumberOfLikes":0,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by LOVE on August 18, 2020.

There's been lots of thinking, praying and learning; and the first thing that emerges is that I'm so much happier when I'm busier.  And that's not just about being busy for busy sake, but about feeling purposeful. \n\nI found the last two days of our holiday really challenging because I didn't have enough to occupy my mind.  I felt aimless which led to the rabbit hole of anxiety which is so inflated with covid19.\n\nI then came back home and felt anxious about not being needed and not knowing what the future holds etc etc.  But I reached out to friends and colleagues and they helped me change my perspective.\n\nThat's the link to this image - it's something I doodled as a mosaic design and then rotated and rotated and rotated.  It's amazing how different it looks from the varying angles and distances.  And so it is with everything in life, changing viewpoints and distance can bring another aspect into focus.\n\nSo tonight I go to bed feeling more together, more ok with myself, more relaxed and more tired so hopefully I'll sleep well.\n\n I'm sure my mood will change again as quickly as ever in these pandemic days, but with tools in place to help me I'm hanging on in there.  I hope you are as well.\n\nNight all\n\n#lineart #linedrawing #pendrawing #doodling #doodlesofinstagram #sketchbook #artjournal #digitalart #perspective #selfreflection #mentalhealth #anxiety #depression #peace #calm #holiday #vocation #covid19 #pandemic #Lockdown #igauthors #igart #instaart #instawriter #moodedits","NumberOfLikes":13,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Emma on August 18, 2020.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597789740,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 19 00:29:00 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Womenswear BTS from WILLIAM LEI Pandemic Show LA 08\/14\n.\n.\nPhotographer @keysopendoerrs \nMUAH @messaycosmo @beautyexpresss_ \nModel @olia.art @danielle.vandyk.e @alisa099 \n.\n.\n.\n.\n#williamlei #runwayshow  #lafw #nyfw #mensfashion #womenfashion #fashionforwomen #fashionformen #instafashion #fashionista #ootd #ootdfashion #dapper #love #support #runwayshow #mensstyle #fashion #suit #suits #menfashion #menstyleguide  #sffashion #styleinspo  #fashionshows #runway #pandemic #losangeles #digitalrunway #virtualshow #thereserve #pandemic","NumberOfLikes":257,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":19,"Timestamp":1597789578,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 19 00:26:18 CEST 2020","Location":"The Reserve"},{"CaptionText":".\nMúsica: @me.du.s4 🖤\n.\nMIDAIR  PERFO\n.\nEn igtv\n.\n#performance  #performanceart #actriz #arte #art #artecontemporaneo #argentina #buenosaires #2020 #cuarentena #cuarentenacreativa #pandemia  #pandemic","NumberOfLikes":16,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by @barb.merk2 on August 18, 2020 tagging @me.du.s4.

In ensuring that Nimi participates fully in online learning, I spent a lot of time with her. Before covid, she would go to school and when she got back home, she had a lesson teacher or the therapist work with her.\n\nDuring this pandemic, I was the teacher, shadow teacher, lesson teacher and therapist. So, I was able to personally discover a lot of things about the way my daughter learns and much more.\n\nOne of the things I learnt to do was to work around her speech impairment.\n\nIf you are not conversant with how she speaks, you may not hear her clearly all the time. There are some words that may come out very clear but sentences are always hard to follow.\n\nThe truth is that for kids with speech impairment, they would rather not talk. This is because it takes a lot of effort for them to speak. I can also assume that they keep quiet because when they finally speak and the recipient of the information says, \u2018I didn\u2019t get that, can you say it again?\u2019 That can become very frustrating.\n\nThe funniest thing is that Nimi\u2019s year one classmates and her class teacher understands her most of the time.\n\nIn the house, Pemi understands her words very well although most times she turns it in her favour. \u2018Nimi said she wants to have ice-cream.\u2019\n\nOne faithful day, Pemi was upstairs in her dad\u2019s study having her online class and Nimi was having her class downstairs with me. While Nimi\u2019s class was going on, her teacher was using some slides to teach then Nimi said a word that her caregiver and I thought sounded like \u2018yin-d-om.\u2019 I kept saying to Nimi, \u2018I didn\u2019t get that, do you mean \u2026..i mentioned a few things and she kept saying \u2018no.\u2019\n\nWhen Nimi speaks and she is not understood, she gets frustrated and starts to cry. The outcome of that is that all activities that she is engaged in at that moment stops and she will not go on until you understand what she is saying. What you end up having is a frustrated Nimi and a frustrated mummy.\n\nCont'd in the comment section.","NumberOfLikes":9,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Special Needs Mum on August 18, 2020.

Nero fiddled while Rome burned; Trump golfs. His actions fanned this pandemic resulting in over 170,000 deaths and a nation still unprepared to protect its people. Furthermore, Trump\u2019s negligence has exacerbated the economic crisis we are now experiencing. Since this pandemic began, over 30 million people have lost their jobs and many have lost their health insurance. Millions of working families are wondering how they'll feed their kids and worried that they will be evicted from their homes. And how has Trump responded? Instead of maintaining the $600 a week #unemployment supplement that workers were receiving, and the $1,200 emergency checks that many of you received, instead of helping small businesses\u2014Trump concocted fraudulent executive orders that do virtually nothing to address the crisis while threatening the very future of #socialsecurity and #medicare.

It has forever changed the world as we know it. Our government and us as America people did not take this matter seriously in the beginning and now is paying the price for it(like usual🤦🏾). Now it\u2019s up to us to stop it. we must take responsibility and must band together to fight and stop the spread of this deadly virus from taking more lives and hurting more people by doing our part in this. This isn\u2019t a political thing, this isn\u2019t a issue we can easily ignore, it\u2019s not a thing that\u2019s targeting a selected group of race, religion, sexuality, gender, or ages. It\u2019s a deadly virus that has no remorse, no mercy, no care in the world, no motive, no conscious, just more determined to wipe out. We are all targets now and will we continue to be if we continue not doing are part in this. The arrogance of man and the human race itself is thinking nature is our control and not other way around. For centuries in human history, the invasion of viruses surges through from different time periods. Some are deadly than the next and some we deal with on a regular basis. Therefore, we should at least be prepared something like this. But unfortunately because of our selfish, shallow, mislead, pride, ego, not minding our surroundings and beyond that, we and our so called leaders allow this virus to happen and now has raged on worsened than it did when it started. Blinding us from the simple and obvious truth. We are all going suffer and the next generation will suffer even harder and there is nothing you can do to stop it unless we change our actions and our ways of thinking and to work together for a better future  and for a better life for us and the ones that come after us. It\u2019s time to actually learn and listen from this pandemic. We owe to the ones who lost there lives and are suffering now. Change has come forcibly and aggressively. It\u2019s just a matter of what are we\u2019re going to do with it.

The government is free to transfer money to the disaster response fund if it feels it is appropriate to do so, the top court said.\n\nAny contribution or grant can be credited to the NDRF and anyone can make a voluntary contribution, the top court said as it heard a petition by an NGO called the Centre for Public Interest Litigation. The petition had asked the court to direct the transfer of contributions made to the PM CARES Fund for the pandemic to the National Disaster Response Fund. The PM CARES fund violates the provisions of the Disaster Management Act, the petition argued.\n The Supreme Court refused to give such an instruction to the centre.\n The court also said there is no need for a new plan and that one under the National Disaster Management Act, made by the government last November, is enough to deal with COVID-19. \n  The centre has defended the PM CARES Fund, saying it is a voluntary fund while budgetary allocations took care of the disaster response fund. It argued that just because the latter exists does not prohibit the creation of the PM Cares Fund for voluntary donations.\n#pmcaresfund #pm #primeminister #modi #bjp #fund #covid19 #corona #coronavirus #india #indian #supremecourt #gkfacts #gkunion #gkelite #gk #generalknowledge #gkforyou1 #education #latest #dailynews #dailyupdate #pandemic #2020","NumberOfLikes":11,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597779216,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 18 21:33:36 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Screw #cnn has the worst reputation.

Is Texas Next?\n\nIn 2019, Democratic legislators gained a majority in both #Virginia state House and #Senate for the first time in decades. After polls had closed, a survey of 600 swing district voters commissioned by gun control advocacy group Everytown For #gunsafety (Everytown) found that the issue that had most impacted their votes wasn\u2019t related to the economy or even health care. It was a lawmaker\u2019s position on #guns.\n\nFollowing the #virginiabeach mass shooting, Everytown spent $2.5 million on the state\u2019s legislative races, focusing on Republican lawmakers who had resisted passing gun reform. Everytown became the largest outside spender in the election, outspending the #nationalrifleassociation (NRA) by a four-to-one margin.\n\nBut can gun safety issues similarly mobilize voters in 2020 amid what to many may seem more pressing issues: a global #pandemic mass #unemployment and calls to end systemic #racism ? Everytown believes so\u2014the group, largely financed by #michaelbloomberg is hoping to repeat their success in Virginia with $10 million focused on state legislative races alone, including seven-figure buys aimed at flipping state legislative chambers in #arizona #northcarolina #innesota #pennsylvania #Iowa and even #texas","NumberOfLikes":9,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Borders News on August 18, 2020.

We may still be afraid and uncertain, but so many of our given circumstances were unknown then, and the grief was fresh.\n\nWhen I got started with @jenwaldmanstudio online in May, @markshanahannyc taught a 3-minute Film Festival class where the goal was, regardless of experience, to create a short film.\n\nI never thought I\u2019d share this, because of all the things I am, a filmmaker I am not.

When her final year at the Nature Center was abruptly cut short in March due to the pandemic there were A LOT of big 5yo feelings. Those feelings have not gone away. Berkeley has mentioned countless times in the last 5 months how much she misses school, her teachers and her friends. She\u2019s cried. She\u2019s had tantrums. She has demanded that we let her go back to her school (again with the 5yo feelings. She has no real way of understanding the world right now.). Then we got an email last week that asked all the 4Kers to come back to have a proper last day of school. Keith and I were thrilled for B. And then we didn\u2019t mention it until this morning (if you\u2019re a parent or caregiver I do not need to explain this to you).\n\u2022\nShe was elated when daddy dropped her off at school today.

In those with severe disease, a sepsis-like cytokine storm can result in multiple systems being affected in addition to many apparently unrelated symptoms. But they are connected in the underlying cause, immune dysregulation.⠀\n⠀\nIn functional medicine, we focus on the root cause. How can we address inflammation and help the body to have a controlled inflammatory response?⠀\n⠀\nI plan on highlighting this new phenomenon and, in the next few weeks, doing some videos on it.

Book description below⬇️\n\nJake Parker\u2019s world collapsed with the violent death of his wife during a police-led raid. In the awful aftermath, he hung up his detective\u2019s badge for good. Now ex-military, ex-police, he has embraced a simple civilian life. But when a deadly new disease begins to threaten American lives, Jake is dragged out of his self-imposed retirement.\n\nWhen a young family at a remote detention center die from a mysterious illness, Jake is contacted by a government official to launch a covert investigation. An unknown disease has entered the system, causing agonizing death and visible signs of blood pooling beneath the skin, and it seems to be spreading. If Jake can\u2019t get on the ground quickly to eliminate the threat before it becomes an epidemic, countless more innocent lives could be at risk.\n\nWith the help of medical professor Eliza Mendoza, Jake heads to the border, but what they uncover there is evidence that this devastating disease is man-made, and part of a calculated plot aimed right at the heart of government. With powerful forces ranged against him, Jake must use all his ingenuity to bring down the ruthless organization behind the attack. Failure is not an option.","NumberOfLikes":235,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by The Librarian Dad on August 18, 2020 tagging @thenickthacker, @netgalley, @bookstagram_engage_page, @nextreadbuddies, and @texasbookstafriends.

Protect them, stay lit!\n\n🙆 Work from home, home schooling, quarantine days, physical distancing, lock down isolation and what not. Since the pandemic, some of us have formed new habbits, and some others struggle to keep old habbits in place. But I am sure most of us are doing more 'screen time' than ever! It is the amount of time spent using a device with a screen- a smartphone, computer, television, or video game console. \n\n🤷\u200D♀️ I try to have a balanced routine between screen time and activities like yoga, meditation, walk in the park or cook. I thought I was doing great until someone pointed out that I was doing it all wrong! It is not only the amount of time you spend on screens, but the way you do it. \n\n💁 Check out this 20-20-20 rule below that will  help you protect your eyes and vision. I set phone reminders just before I start using my phone or computer; or even binge watch Netflix, and that really helps!  If you already know about it, then please do share it with others. \n\n📍The 20-20-20 rule:  Every 20 minutes spent using a screen, you should try to look away at something that is 20 feet away from you for a full 20 seconds.📍\n\n💆 Also;\n\n➡️ Get artificial tears\/teardrops at your local drugstore to use when your eyes feel dry.\n\n➡️ Blink often to help replenish your eye\u2019s own tears.\n\n➡️ Dim your screen if it\u2019s much brighter than the rest of the light in the area. You could also adjust the room lights to reduce contrasting effect.\n\n➡️ Keep your screens clean. Dirty screens with fingerprints and scratches can be a strain your eyes.\n\n👁️👁️ u soon...\n\n#eyes #protectyoureyes #eyesarethewindowtothesoul #healthylifestyle #healthfirst #202020 #2020 #perfectvision #dryeyes #computervision #screentime #doitright #setexamples #healthpost #share #shareyourstory #staysafe #covid_19 #coviddiaries #pandemic #workfromhome #wfh #tips #hacks #lifehacks #wellness #wellbeing #netflix #bingewatching","NumberOfLikes":35,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Sravani Kucherlapati on August 18, 2020.

Одно заклеено стикером \"не садиться \", одно свободное. \n\nОгромное количество людей занимается на улице спортом не смотря на сорокоградусную жару. За карантин видимо поднабрали. \n\nПролцвел салонный бизнес на дому.
