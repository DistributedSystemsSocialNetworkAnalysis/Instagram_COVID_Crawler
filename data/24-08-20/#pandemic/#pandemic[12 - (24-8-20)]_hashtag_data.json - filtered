This is a nine-week high and anything more than this unemployment rate was recorded in the week ended 14 June. This is even higher than the monthly overall joblessness rate of July (7.43%) and even the monthly unemployment rate recorded before covid-19 outbreak in the country, as per CMIE data.\n\nThe rural unemployment rate climbed to 8.86% in the week to 16 August as against 8.37% in the week before. This is also a nine-week high since the week ended 14 June when the joblessness rate was 10.96%. The lowest rural unemployment rate in recent times was recorded in the week ended 12 July. Then the summer crop sowing was in full swing across the country and the sowing acreage was much higher than last year.\n\nSimilarly, the urban unemployment rate was recorded at 9.61% in the week ended 16 August as against 9.31% previous week. The urban unemployment crept up for the second consecutive week and experts argue that urban joblessness will continue to stay high in the short to medium term point of view.\n\n#unemployment #insta #instagood #instadaily #instalike #instamood #instagram #instanews #instafollow #follow4followback #likesforlike #likeforlikes #picoftheday #india #news #modi #pmo #pmmodi #narendramodi #coronatime #corona #virus #pandemic #lockdownindia #lockdown2020 #quarantine","NumberOfLikes":2,"Hashtags":["#unemployment","#insta","#instagood","#instadaily","#instalike","#instamood","#instagram","#instanews","#instafollow","#follow4followback","#likesforlike","#likeforlikes","#picoftheday","#india","#news","#modi","#pmo","#pmmodi","#narendramodi","#coronatime","#corona","#virus","#pandemic","#lockdownindia","#lockdown2020","#quarantine"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Khabar Aaj Tak on August 18, 2020.

But everything is so different when it actually happens to you, at the time it happens to you, in the situation it happens to you.\n\nMy number one goal in life is to be a mother and raise a healthy, full, family. So my abortion felt like a punishment, a twist of fate that I never imagined myself going through with. I found that other than SYA there were no other resources out there to explore and relate to all different types of abortion stories and opinions.\n\nIt might be an unpopular opinion, but I didn\u2019t feel empowered or strong getting an abortion. I do feel lucky I had a choice, but for someone who always talked openly about the \u2018what if\u2019 of getting pregnant at 25 and saying I would 100% keep it; it felt like I was letting myself down and letting my expectations for my life down.\n\nAn abortion is an impossible choice, if it even is a choice, and all I can help but think now is, if I didn\u2019t have the privilege of even making a choice, I would be in so much more pain. My partner and I were only four months into dating and having issues being in quarantine together so early in a relationship; and then me getting pregnant on top of everything really tore us down.\n\nIf I didn\u2019t have a right as a human to make an informed decision about my future, then I would be forever linking myself to someone who isn\u2019t healthy for me, and burdening myself and them with a life changing thing that as 25 year olds with no strong hold on life itself, would destroy us and the baby\u2019s future.\n\n\u2026For me, abortion was not just a procedure and nothing else. Abortion can be a gift, a burden, or for me: a lesson in life\u2019s real hardships.\u201D 💚 #shoutyourabortion #abortion #proabortion #humanrights #pandemic #healthcare","NumberOfLikes":559,"Hashtags":["#shoutyourabortion","#abortion","#proabortion","#humanrights","#pandemic","#healthcare"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Shout Your Abortion on August 18, 2020.

I felt like the whole world was finally on my level. Isolation, anger, and fear are my go-to emotions. I felt a powerful desire to stay strong and show others that this global crisis will not destroy my inner peace. Day in and day out for over 5 months, I put on my brave face and walked through the storm with my head held high. Last Sunday, I felt this indescribable turmoil inside of my soul. It came out nowhere and I was immediately engulfed in fear and trapped in my own emotional hell. My best friend called me multiple times and the only thing that I was able to muster up as a reply through text was \"I don't feel like chitty chatting.\" \n.\nI knew if I spoke to her on the phone, she would immediately know that something was amiss. I have absolutely NO reason to be feeling the way that I have been feeling. Knowing that is a double-edged sword. How can you adequately describe a feeling that you yourself aren't able to properly define? That shame cycle overruns all logic and common sense when you're in the midst of it. \n.\nI am a firm believer that when we talk about the hard stuff, even if we inadequately describe it, it takes some of the power away. I have lost the luxury of stuffing my feelings and pretending that \"I'm fine\", that's a very dangerous and slippery slope for a person like myself. If I am honest with myself, my soul is tired really fucking tired. I need to honor that feeling knowing that it does not have the power to define who I am today. Hugs and Love to anyone else feeling this way. I know that I am alone. \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#empath #honoryourself #depressionhelp #depression #anxiety #mentalhealth  #suicidesurvivor #pandemic #honoryourfeelings #itsokaynottobeokay #checkonyourstrongfriends #sobermom #soberaf #globalcrisis #writerstag","NumberOfLikes":10,"Hashtags":["#empath","#honoryourself","#depressionhelp","#depression","#anxiety","#mentalhealth","#suicidesurvivor","#pandemic","#honoryourfeelings","#itsokaynottobeokay","#checkonyourstrongfriends","#sobermom","#soberaf","#globalcrisis","#writerstag"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Danielle Gregorich on August 18, 2020.

This means your business assets and liabilities are not separate from your personal assets and liabilities. You can be held personally liable for the debts and obligations of the business. Sole proprietors are still able to get a trade name.

The city of 11 million, and much of the surrounding #Hubei province, were placed under strict lockdown to halt the spread of the virus. The lockdown included drastic measures such as people getting their front doors welded shut, if one is to believe photos circulating online.\n\nFast-forward to this past weekend, when AFP published photos and video of an electronic music festival at the Wuhan #MayaBeachWaterPark.\n\nThough local media say the park officially operates at 50 percent capacity, \"none of the tightly-packed partygoers were seen to be wearing face masks,\" the French news agency reported.\nAFP added the official explanation that \"there have been no new domestically transmitted cases officially reported in Hubei province\" since mid-May, and that the 76-day lockdown had been lifted in April.\n\nWhile nearby countries such as #SouthKorea and #Japan managed to keep track of the people infected and suppressed the epidemic without a lockdown, almost every other country in the world has implemented the Wuhan model to some extent or another - and got nowhere near the same result.\n\nThe US has now been locked down to some extent or another for twice as long as Wuhan - 154 days as of Monday - though it was originally supposed to be only \"15 days to slow the spread.\" As a result, the economy has ground to a halt, small businesses have been ruined, and millions are facing eviction for being unable to afford rent.

Some things that I\u2019ve got into habit is not doing Ab workouts on the floor and always cleaning my machines before and after usage. Sanitize your phone before walking out the gym, and wash your hands. Never put your gym bag or water bottle on the ground and if you do sanitize after you pick the items off the floor. Also- try to head to the gym during their quiet hours (11am-3pm) there are much less people and it\u2019s a lot easier to social distance.

So many granite rocks.  Petrified ice.  The mid-point of this drive is by this stream.  This year someone built a rock dam so that the water is in a pool for relaxing.  R then told me he had a place to show me that would blow my mind.  One mile from where we hung out.  A place he had only just discovered a few weeks ago when he did this drive while I was working.

We met in Ghana when I worked there during the summer of 2018. He was our driver, and since I get carsick easily, I always rode in the front so we had plenty of time to chat. From the first day, I was smitten because he had the biggest, most beautiful smile I\u2019d ever seen. Over the next few weeks we slowly got to know each other and began dating. By the time I left to go back to the states two months later, we knew we didn\u2019t want to live without each other, and he asked me to marry him. We\u2019ve spent the two years since then being put through the immigration ringer over and over, and now with Covid-19, we are no nearer to being able to be together. It\u2019s incredibly frustrating. I miss him so much! We have plans for a Ghanaian\/American wedding at my uncles\u2019 property in western Mass as soon as he arrives. Praying for the pandemic to end soon so we can finally be together!! I love you, Isaac!\u201D \n\n💔** Only if you have been in an international long-distance relationship can you truly understand the struggles of fiancé\/spouse visas & immigration!

The three-island complex is also referred to as \"Chouteau Island\". The island is manmade, having been created during the construction of the Chain of Rocks Canal between 1946 and 1953. Most of Chouteau Island lies in Chouteau Township, but its southern quarter lies in Venice Township, both in Madison County. Gabaret Island and Mosenthein Island both lie entirely in Venice Township.\n.\nChouteau Island is 3200 acres. Chouteau Island is bounded by the Mississippi River to the west and the Chain of Rocks Canal to the east. The 10 miles (16 km) of Mississippi River that border the Island on the west is the only natural stretch of the Mississippi without barge traffic between St. Paul, Minnesota, and New Orleans, Louisiana.\n.\nChouteau Island is accessed by car only from Illinois via the Canal Bridge, a two-lane vehicular bridge that crosses the Chain of Rocks Canal. From Missouri, visitors may reach the Island by foot or bicycle traffic via U.S. Route 66's Old Chain of Rocks Bridge.\n.\nChouteau Island is a key part of the Confluence Greenway, a regional recreation corridor. Popular events on the Island, include Eagle Days (held each January for watching bald eagles) and various recreational bicycle rides. Several walking\/biking trails have been developed on the Island.\n.\n#chainofrocksbridge #stl #stlouis #stlouisgram #choteauisland #mississippiriver #missouriadventure #missourionly #saintlouis #everything_imaginable #route66  #enjoyillinois  #explorestlouis #shutterbug_collective  #hey_ihadtosnapthat #raw_architecture #chainofrockscanal #riverview #lewisandclark #stlphotography #goandcapturethelight #wow_america #usa_photolovers #stlouisonly #icu_usa #stlphotographer #mississippiriver #coronavirus #pandemic #fx_hdr","NumberOfLikes":140,"Hashtags":["#chainofrocksbridge","#stl","#stlouis","#stlouisgram","#choteauisland","#mississippiriver","#missouriadventure","#missourionly","#saintlouis","#everything_imaginable","#route66","#enjoyillinois","#explorestlouis","#shutterbug_collective","#hey_ihadtosnapthat","#raw_architecture","#chainofrockscanal","#riverview","#lewisandclark","#stlphotography","#goandcapturethelight","#wow_america","#usa_photolovers","#stlouisonly","#icu_usa","#stlphotographer","#mississippiriver","#coronavirus","#pandemic","#fx_hdr"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":7,"Timestamp":1597758700,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 18 15:51:40 CEST 2020","Location":"Chouteau Island"},{"CaptionText":"Mental Wellbeing during the pandemic \n\n5\/20 - \"Income does not far exceed personal development\" Jim Rohn\n\nIf all the money in the world got divided up equally among us all, within a year, it would be in exactly the same pockets as it is now.

It entered our country and now it is starting to enter our homes. It\u2019s no more happening to them;\nit\u2019s right here knocking on our doors and we\u2019re shooting at it with sanitizers and soaps.\n\nWe want our business partners to know that they\u2019re not alone during such a crisis. HomeFirst recognises their\ninvaluable efforts and we cherish the relationship that we share. They\u2019re the Jai to our Veeru, Dr. Watson to our\nSherlock and Amit to our Narendra. Since we understand how the pandemic might be affecting them and their\nfamilies, we want to make sure that they don\u2019t undergo a situation where their lives are severely impacted. To\nenable them to keep working on their priorities, HomeFirst has decided to offer a special health benefit to its Key\nContributors, covering over 500 valued business partners.\nHomeFirst has tied up with ICICI Lombard and is offering a complimentary insurance cover for Covid-19 disease. The\ntotal sum insured is Rs.1,00,000 which includes hospitalisation and home quarantine. While we\u2019d hate it if our\npartners have to use this, but we\u2019d hate it even more if they do not have any support from us from when they need\nit the most. The benefits under this scheme cover pre-hospitalisation, emergency ambulance and post-\nhospitalisation as well. For more details, our Relationship Managers would be glad to answer any queries. To claim\nthese benefits in case of contracting the disease, the individual insured needs to call the toll-free number 18002666.\nThen state the policy number, member ID, first name and last name.\n\nThe intended business partners have been covered automatically under this policy without a need for prior\nregistration and we have already started rolling out the welcome letters! It\u2019s a small way of thanking our partners\nand letting them know that we got their back.\n\n#insurance #cover #HomeFirst #partners #connectors #DSA #business #COVID #pandemic #health ##healthinsurance #care #important #coronavirus #healthcare #grattitude #thankyou #India #OneLakh #ICICI #ICICIlombard #hospital #expense #quarantine #home #work","NumberOfLikes":79,"Hashtags":["#insurance","#cover","#HomeFirst","#partners","#connectors","#DSA","#business","#COVID","#pandemic","#health","#healthinsurance","#care","#important","#coronavirus","#healthcare","#grattitude","#thankyou","#India","#OneLakh","#ICICI","#ICICIlombard","#hospital","#expense","#quarantine","#home","#work"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597758379,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 18 15:46:19 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#ArtMatters #ArtIsLife #LifeIsArt #Create #Enjoy #Share ...

Los resultados de la fase 2, publicados a finales de julio, demostraron que la vacuna es segura y capaz de inducir respuestas inmunes en la mayoría de los pacientes.\n\nLa efectividad del medicamento se confirmará durante la fase 3 de las pruebas, que se llevará a cabo en Arabia Saudita con la participación de 5.000 voluntarios, según anunció a principios del mes el Ministerio de Salud del reino árabe. CanSino asimismo mantiene conversaciones para poder realizarla en otros países, entre los cuales figuran Rusia, Brasil y Chile.\n\nLa vacuna china se vale de un virus del resfriado común modificado para transportar material genético del coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 al cuerpo humano, un método utilizado también por la vacuna desarrollada por la Universidad de Oxford y AstraZeneca, que presentó los datos de sus primeras pruebas en humanos el mismo día y con conclusiones parecidas.\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n#rtenespañol #noticias #actualidadrt #rtplayes #news #coronavirus #covid19 #pandemic #pandemia #china #vacuna","NumberOfLikes":14,"Hashtags":["#rtenespañol","#noticias","#actualidadrt","#rtplayes","#news","#coronavirus","#covid19","#pandemic","#pandemia","#china","#vacuna"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Rolando A Garcia on August 18, 2020.

She Dies Tomorrow is a bold, patient and sure-to-be polarising film with one hell of an intriguing premise; Kate Lyn Sheil's Amy has a gut feeling that she's gonna die tomorrow. She just knows it - as certain as one can be. Like the instinctive confidence when you know you're about to come down with a cold.\n\nAnd it's contagious! Perhaps the Covid-commentary we've been needing, everyone Amy comes in contact with similarly becomes a nihilistic negative nancy. Seimetz does an incredible job of building a film around an intensely bare and skeletal framework. Through it\u2019s glacial pacing and sparse dialogue, the film inhabits an ethereal ambiguity where the nature of this transcendental contagion remains as murky and distant as what's going on in the heads of any of these characters. What this achieves is a satisfying openness in the film\u2019s ideas - it can be read as a subversively still and quiet apocalypse movie, or perhaps an impressionistic meditation on depression, anxiety and fear of mortality, or yes, even the most artful look at the Covid crisis.\n\nAmy Seimetz\u2019s eye is captivating in its choices. The film is strikingly directed and framed; contrasting stunning abstract imagery with rigid staging and composition that often keeps us at arm\u2019s length from the story\u2019s more external bursts of action. Which could be frustrating for some, but the restraint reinforces the internalised and detached energy of the film; the omission of key moments feeling like an intrinsic extension of the subject. And that\u2019s what I loved about the film. Despite some uneven pacing in the second half and a frustrating conclusion, both aesthetically and thematically the film feels cohesive as an exercise in style and restraint...\n\n\u2022MORE IN COMMENTS\u2022\nRating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️\/5\n\n#shediestomorrow #moviereview #newrelease #new #movie #film #she #dies #tomorrow #movieposter #amyseimetz #2020 #cinema #pandemic #drama #surreal #neon #surrealism #thriller #fear","NumberOfLikes":46,"Hashtags":["#shediestomorrow","#moviereview","#newrelease","#new","#movie","#film","#she","#dies","#tomorrow","#movieposter","#amyseimetz","#2020","#cinema","#pandemic","#drama","#surreal","#neon","#surrealism","#thriller","#fear"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1597755816,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 18 15:03:36 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Jangan Lupa Memakai Masker 🇮🇩🇮🇩\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#newpost #brihits #latepost #pandemic #behealthy","NumberOfLikes":24,"Hashtags":["#newpost","#brihits","#latepost","#pandemic","#behealthy"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Iwan R.

Los resultados de la fase 2, publicados a finales de julio, demostraron que la vacuna es segura y capaz de inducir respuestas inmunes en la mayoría de los pacientes.\n\nLa efectividad del medicamento se confirmará durante la fase 3 de las pruebas, que se llevará a cabo en Arabia Saudita con la participación de 5.000 voluntarios, según anunció a principios del mes el Ministerio de Salud del reino árabe. CanSino asimismo mantiene conversaciones para poder realizarla en otros países, entre los cuales figuran Rusia, Brasil y Chile.\n\nLa vacuna china se vale de un virus del resfriado común modificado para transportar material genético del coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 al cuerpo humano, un método utilizado también por la vacuna desarrollada por la Universidad de Oxford y AstraZeneca, que presentó los datos de sus primeras pruebas en humanos el mismo día y con conclusiones parecidas.\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n#sertelmedios #republicadominicana #moca #santiagodeloscaballeros #santodomingo #puntacana #china #Wuhan #Internacional #Coronavirus #mexico #italia #puertorico #haiti #España #covid19rd vía @actualidadrt #coronavirus #covid19 #pandemic #pandemia #china #vacuna","NumberOfLikes":748,"Hashtags":["#sertelmedios","#republicadominicana","#moca","#santiagodeloscaballeros","#santodomingo","#puntacana","#china","#Wuhan","#Internacional","#Coronavirus","#mexico","#italia","#puertorico","#haiti","#España","#covid19rd","#coronavirus","#covid19","#pandemic","#pandemia","#china","#vacuna"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Sertel Medios on August 18, 2020.

We are all establishing our new normal and trying to figure out our post Covid life. Although my father-in-law is still in the hospital, thankfully off of the vent and on the floors, we know not only does he, but we all have a long road ahead.\n\nAfter talking to a few other physicians that have also contracted Covid, it just boggles my mind how some people get so lucky and others have a worse time. I know all the statistics, data, I talk about it, I write about it, I even make videos and do interviews about it. I know What constitutes a chronic medical condition, I\u2019ve read all the studies that predispose people to worst case of Covid and more. But it still doesn\u2019t make sense and this virus really is like none other we have seen.\n\nMy family and I are very healthy, we eat well, take supplements and despite the craziness of life and stress our immune systems saved us all because I enforce certain lifestyle measures. \n\nBy the grace of God this time we all got lucky. But, it makes me sad to know that this virus has not officially gone yet and still lingers on. Yes, we now have antibodies, but they\u2019re only gonna last for about 2 to 3 months. I know the numbers will continue to rise and honestly, cold and flu season along with Covid really scares me.  with concern of mutations and new strains who knows what could happen next time! \n\nSo I caution you, Especially now that school has restarted and some people have sent their kids to school:\n\n-wear your mask 😷 \n-wash your hands 🧼\n-disinfect disinfect disinfect 🧽🧹\n-social distance 📱\n-check you temp occasionally when feeling under the weather 🌡\n-strength your immune system and invest in your health today and now! (I will make another post on what to do to take and do if and when you get covid) 🧬💊\n\nThank you so much for all the continued love support and prayers over the last few weeks.🙏🏽 \n\n📷 @rachaelgliebe @ragartistry \n\n#covidjourney #socialdance #wearamask #covid19 #pandemic #functionalmedicine #integrativemedicine #holistichealth #immunesupport #immunehealth #immunityboost #ahealthierlifestyle #wegotthis","NumberOfLikes":252,"Hashtags":["#covidjourney","#socialdance","#wearamask","#covid19","#pandemic","#functionalmedicine","#integrativemedicine","#holistichealth","#immunesupport","#immunehealth","#immunityboost","#ahealthierlifestyle","#wegotthis"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Bindiya Gandhi, M.D on August 18, 2020.

I wasn\u2019t really on a vacation. To go or not to go was a really tough decision to make. At no point did I stop feeling guilty or unsafe. And I learned a lot.\n.\nFor those of you who don\u2019t know, my partner is an arborist, essentially a paid monkey. 🐵 He received a fantastic opportunity to go down to Florida and help another arborist (and family member) take down some enormous trees that were getting too big and dangerous for homes. They mill the exotic wood and turn it into beautiful tables, bowls, and shelves. 😍 It was a great chance to try something new, gain experience, and to see if Florida potentially fit into our story. This was the first time since March that we felt like our lives weren\u2019t being put on hold and we were taking control of our future. I also worked (remotely) every day, and we did some exploring in the evenings.\n.\nWhat we learned: There is no truly \u201Csafe\u201D way to travel right now. When you break down every interaction, every potential exposure, and every place you\u2019ve been during an excursion like this, it\u2019s overwhelming. Surprise! not everyone respects your 6-foot bubble. Sometimes you make exceptions to pick something up for an elderly person. Sometimes a really cute baby offers you her slimy water bottle. Some of the planes were shoulder to shoulder, some were every other row. Don\u2019t get me wrong, we still enjoyed ourselves, but at what cost?\n.\nThe entire experience was pretty surreal. For those of you that know me, you know I\u2019ve done a lot of traveling in my few years on this planet. The airport has always been a place of excitement, promise and opportunity. Traveling has very different baggage now. Each of us are now carrying heavy responsibility as citizens of the world to keep each other safe. But I have to remind myself... it\u2019s okay. This pandemic doesn\u2019t need just a few people doing everything perfectly, we need everyone doing the best that they can.\n.\nHave you traveled recently? How have you been coping with COVID? I\u2019d love to know!  Maybe having more discussions like these will keep us sane during this crazy times. #covid19 #pandemic #traveler","NumberOfLikes":105,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#pandemic","#traveler"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Emily Eibs in Tampa International Airport.

Compared to the risk of COVID-19, it's so small as to be nearly nonexistent. \n\nIn fact, the odds of death are 33x greater than an American dies from COVID-19 than they are that they even use a firearm at all, in any capacity during a violent or property crime.\n\nIf COVID-19 and the risk of death is not a big deal, then the potential for needing a firearm in defense of self is really, really not a big deal.

Los resultados de la fase 2, publicados a finales de julio, demostraron que la vacuna es segura y capaz de inducir respuestas inmunes en la mayoría de los pacientes.\n\nLa efectividad del medicamento se confirmará durante la fase 3 de las pruebas, que se llevará a cabo en Arabia Saudita con la participación de 5.000 voluntarios, según anunció a principios del mes el Ministerio de Salud del reino árabe. CanSino asimismo mantiene conversaciones para poder realizarla en otros países, entre los cuales figuran Rusia, Brasil y Chile.\n\nLa vacuna china se vale de un virus del resfriado común modificado para transportar material genético del coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 al cuerpo humano, un método utilizado también por la vacuna desarrollada por la Universidad de Oxford y AstraZeneca, que presentó los datos de sus primeras pruebas en humanos el mismo día y con conclusiones parecidas.\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n#rtenespañol #noticias #actualidadrt #rtplayes #news #coronavirus #covid19 #pandemic #pandemia #china #vacuna","NumberOfLikes":3980,"Hashtags":["#rtenespañol","#noticias","#actualidadrt","#rtplayes","#news","#coronavirus","#covid19","#pandemic","#pandemia","#china","#vacuna"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by RT en Español on August 18, 2020.

If the churches were allowed, COVID-19 would have been tamed.\u2063\n\u2063\n\u201CIt is a clear case of orchestrated attack from the pit of hell and the only solution is to use the church to fight it, but the government went for non-spiritual measure hence the panicky measures that induced fear in the masses.\u201D\u2063\n\u2063\nUchenna said COVID-19 had exposed the government\u2019s insensitivity to the yearnings of the masses.\u2063\n\u2063\nHe said hunger had killed more people in Nigeria than COVID-19.\u2063\n\u2063\nThe Bishop said: \u201CA time like this is not one to exclude the church. The true church has a solution for COVID-19. What is COVID-19 when the church can work miracles, raise the dead and cast out demons.\u2063\n\u2063\n\u201CWhy did you (government) suddenly forget the church and chose to fight COVID-19 alone; we are disappointed. However, we did not challenge the government to avoid incitement because of our position of authority, so we silently played it down. But we have to condemn it.\u201D\u2063\n\u2063\nFor more, click the link in our bio.\u2063\n\u2063\n#PBAAS #CharlesUchenna #Churches #Lockdown #COVID19 #Pandemic #Coronavirus #WorshipCentres #Anambara #Spiritual #Religion #Nigeria #TheGuardianNg","NumberOfLikes":47,"Hashtags":["#PBAAS","#CharlesUchenna","#Churches","#Lockdown","#COVID19","#Pandemic","#Coronavirus","#WorshipCentres","#Anambara","#Spiritual","#Religion","#Nigeria","#TheGuardianNg"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597750207,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 18 13:30:07 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"😑😑\n\nFollow @sarcastic__sis_7 for more \n\n#sarcasticus #sarcasmonly #sarcasticmemesarethebest #sarcasticsis #sarcasmmemes #sarcasmquotes #sarcasticmemes #sarcasmmemes #bencho #binodtrending #binodmemes😂 #bakchod_nation #bakchodi #binod #bakchodi_trolls #binodarmy #childhood #chill #childhoodmemories #2020 #2020goals #pandemic #pandemic2020 #pandora","NumberOfLikes":9,"Hashtags":["#sarcasticus","#sarcasmonly","#sarcasticmemesarethebest","#sarcasticsis","#sarcasmmemes","#sarcasmquotes","#sarcasticmemes","#sarcasmmemes","#bencho","#binodtrending","#binodmemes😂","#bakchod_nation","#bakchodi","#binod","#bakchodi_trolls","#binodarmy","#childhood","#chill","#childhoodmemories","#2020","#2020goals","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#pandora"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @sarcastic__sis_7 on August 18, 2020.

That study, which surveyed 5,412 Americans, found that \u201C40.9% of respondents reported at least one adverse mental or behavioral health condition.\u201D According to the new study, 31 percent of respondents were suffering from symptoms of #anxiety or #depression; 26 percent experienced symptoms of traumatic disorder; 13 percent were using drugs or alcohol more heavily, or for the first time, to cope with the pandemic; and 11 percent had seriously contemplated suicide. \u201CYounger adults, racial\/ethnic minorities, essential workers, and unpaid adult caregivers reported having experienced disproportionately worse\u201D mental health outcomes than other groups, the study concluded. These findings represented levels of psychological distress higher relative to pre-pandemic levels. Anxiety symptoms tripled in incidence compared with the same period in 2019; the incidence of depression symptoms quadrupled. The rate of serious suicidal thoughts doubled in comparison to levels recorded in 2018. Significantly, more than 90 percent said they were not being treated for anxiety, depression or posttraumatic stress disorder before the pandemic struck, meaning that their symptoms arrived with the coronavirus and its attendant social disruptions. \nJust how the nation will emerge from that pit remains unclear. Trump has promised a vaccine before the end of the year, but that time frame has been widely described as overly optimistic. Most experts believe that the current state of affairs will continue well into 2021.

Some counties are also experiencing telecommunication and internet breakdowns, said Kevin Pan, CEO and co-founder of PoolIn.\n\nAs result, impacted bitcoin mining farms in the region are forced to unplug from the network for the time being.

Es tan fácil de tomar, y fácil de calentar. Lo mejor es cuando la muerdo. Me gusta ese ruido cuando sé que es mía. No creo poder compartirla. Por lo menos, no lo puedo hacer ahora. Debo saciar mi apetito por ella. Nunca me había sentido tan bien. Había estado con muchas otras, pero nunca había tenido una en el departamento.\n\n¿Por qué nunca me encontré con ella antes? ¿Por qué tenía que ser justo en una cuarentena, justo en una pandemia? ¿Cómo lo habré de hacer para cuando tenga que viajar? Sería muy difícil viajar con ella. Y lo más probable es que quiera probar otras, en el camino, igual a ella o parecidas. Bueno, no que creo que sean tan iguales, la mía siempre será la mejor. Además, estamos recién empezando. Esto apenas comienza. Supongo que nuestro amor irá creciendo.\n\nY para que no perdamos el interés, deberé inventar otras maneras para estar con ella. Las rutinas nunca han sido buenas. Tendré que avivar nuestro amor cada día. Siempre será divertido jugar con nuevos ingredientes dentro de la relación..., noche y día.

Just reading such statics felt overwhelming and scary but we realised the importance of it as we realised the thought of women being in the frontline was scarce. My mother and I have always been conscious of our #nutrition. We were always curious about knowing what went into the food we eat. We realised that there was a huge gap between food brands claiming to be healthy and genuinely being healthy. So we decided to start our very venture-Grainola. We envisioned our company to be a brand which our customers could trust. \n\nMy mother and I became closer as we built on our idea together. Working with her has been so inspiring as I see her getting younger each day, as the brand grows. We launched in 2020 in the midst of a #pandemic, which wasn\u2019t an easy decision but that never stopped us from innovating and flourishing in the new normal.\n\nAs the two women entrepreneurs break the glass ceiling even during what is said to be the most heart-wrenching year of the decade, their efficiency hasn\u2019t plummeted. With the support of my father and younger brother, we aspire to be known as a mother-daughter duo who has changed the existing #landscape of women in entrepreneurship. \n\n#WIN #Winpower #IndianWomen #WinningWomen #WomenInspiringNetwork #womenLeaders #womenempowerment #womensupportingwomen #womeninbusiness #womenchangingtheworld #womenownedbusiness #womeninspiringwomen #womenhelpingwomen #womenwholift #womenpower #womeninspiration","NumberOfLikes":54,"Hashtags":["#entrepreneurship,","#Indian","#start-ups","#women!","#nutrition.","#pandemic,","#landscape","#WIN","#Winpower","#IndianWomen","#WinningWomen","#WomenInspiringNetwork","#womenLeaders","#womenempowerment","#womensupportingwomen","#womeninbusiness","#womenchangingtheworld","#womenownedbusiness","#womeninspiringwomen","#womenhelpingwomen","#womenwholift","#womenpower","#womeninspiration"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Women Inspiring Network on August 18, 2020 tagging @drishtejain, @ritijain19, and @grainola.in.

Here are a few things you should keep in mind apart from following all the safety precautions at the gym premises.\n.\n.\n📆PLAN YOUR WORKOUT - Planning your workout beforehand makes you utilize your gym time. Being clear about what you are going to do without hanging about deciding what to do next not only saves your time but also gives you the confidence to focus on your gains.\n.\n.\n🏋️STAY LIGHT ON WEIGHTS - We know you have missed them! But if you are among those who have not lifted those weights for the past 5 months, lifting heavy suddenly will cause more damage than good. Start with light weights and gradually increase with time.\n.\n.\n🤸\u200D♀️FOCUS ON FORM - You might have been doing certain at-home workouts, but may have missed those you can do only at the gym. If you have been missing lifting weights while at home, first focus on forms before overloading. Consider this comeback as relearning and focus more on your forms if you don\u2019t want to injure yourself.\n.\n.\n🧘BE PATIENT - If you have survived the ruckus in the past few months and still have the eagerness to rejoin the gym, kudos, to you! Stay put and be patient with yourself. Set realistic fitness goals, feel blessed to be able to move well, sleep well, eat well, feel fit, and strong in the past and days to come.\n.\n.\n✅STAY CONSISTENT - Whatever your fitness level is right now, start from wherever you are and look forward to where you want to be. Stay consistent with your workout and food habits once you restart and the results will show.\n.\n.\n🏃\u200D♀️ENJOY WORKOUT & GO SLOW - Last but not the least, enjoy your workout- whatever you do. If you are unsure about getting back to your workout regime, talk to a trainer. Start slow when you are getting back to workout as a sudden peak in intensity will not only make you feel exhausted but will also affect your consistency.\n☺Smile when you wear a mask coz it shows on your eyes, sanitize when you are done with workout coz it shows you care!
