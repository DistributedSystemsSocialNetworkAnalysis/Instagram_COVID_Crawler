The space was very nascent with not much development other than a massive push in the shrimp farming sector. After spending 4 months to set up a shrimp farm which hadn't been used for over 2 years I was able to turn an unused farm to a perfectly functioning one, finally putting in the seedlings for cultivation, spending multiple long nights stressing about water conditions, having quite a few crocodiles wandering into the farm. Hundreds of ferry rides later we were coasting to the finish line, when the monsoons decided to change the tune. \n\nFor three days we watched the River Mandovi rise and recede until it finally covered the entire farm and as it receded, took all the shrimp with it. Wading through waist deep water I was devastated, but wasn't ready to give up just yet. \n\nA year, multiple ferry rides, a pandemic and just the one crocodile later, I've finally got the shrimp to the size of my palm and closed up the farm for the season. It's been a good 6 months in these strange times and an interesting journey from start to finish. Now, as the monsoons make their own music, I can finally focus on my album and all the moments of Goa that I've wanted to capture through sound and photographs.

Every now and then I need a mood changer read and this book was just that. It was witty writing that I found in this book. When you are reading the story you aren't sure what's to follow next and how will this story climax. The first story, Day one, sucked me into this book and I was twirling pages for more. All stories are unique and have a recall value. \u2063\n\u2063\nWithin the small canvas the author has tried to infuse every shade of lockdown. It's quite newsy, relevant and relatable. \u2063\n\u2063\nAfter reading this one I wish to read more from this author and perhaps more such amazing short stories. \u2063\n\u2063\n--\u2063\n Q o t d - Do you read multiple books at a time or one book?

The C.D.C. usually purchases 500,000 doses for uninsured adults, but this year it ordered an additional 9.3 million doses.\n \nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has been imploring people to get the flu shot, \u201Cso that you could at least blunt the effect of one of those two potential respiratory infections.\u201D\n \nA life-threatening respiratory illness that crowds emergency rooms and intensive care units, flu shares symptoms with Covid-19: fever, headache, cough, sore throat, muscle aches and fatigue.

However, a survey claimed that More than half of Russian doctors do not trust Sputnik-V. More than 3,000 healthcare professionals participated in the survey.\n\nThe online survey was obtained by RBC News website on Friday. Around 52 percent of doctors surveyed by the Doctor\u2019s Handbook app said that they would not take the new vaccine. According to the RBC, only 24.5 percent of healthcare workers agreed to get vaccinated. \n\nOf the 52 percent of doctors who showed their reluctance in taking the vaccine, 66 percent cited insufficient data, while 48 percent gave the reason that Sputnik-V was developed very fast.\n\nWhile responding to the survey, Deputy Health Minister Oleg Salagay wrote on Telegram, \u201CBut one shouldn\u2019t confuse trust with the official assessment of safety and efficiency. These results allow experts to conclude that the vaccine can be used.\u201D Frontline healthcare workers and teachers in Russia will be the first to get vaccinated. \n\nOn Sunday, Russia began production of the first batch of vaccines against COVID-19. However, the third stage of Sputnik-V will be carried in parallel to its production.

Isolation in close quarters, difficulty connecting in person, loneliness, and fear cause many of us to feel that much more dependent and interdependent with romantic partners. 👨\u200D❤️\u200D💋\u200D👨Long-standing tensions are coming to a head causing break ups, separations and divorce. Couples strive for unity and harmony in areas where they disagree \u2014whether it is Covid risk, political change, or the value of binge watching Avatar: The Last Airbender \u2014 leading to deception and resentment. Those who long for partnership lose sight of what they value to capture it or idealize what things could be like if they were with another person. People who are happy alone question whether there is something wrong with them. 👩\u200D❤️\u200D💋\u200D👩The Pandemic time gives us all an opportunity to deeply examine our priorities, values, and desires, both individually and in relationships. And that is something that is best done alone. 🤷🏾\u200D♀️Only when we know what we long for, care about, and feel passion for in our own lives \u2014 and are honest with ourselves and our loves \u2014can we be together without disappointment and resentment.

I realized this week that I have become a front line worker of the racial pandemic. Ever since the murder of #georgefloyd, my practice has welcomed increasing numbers of black people seeking refuge and support as they try their best to excel in the face of dehumanizing treatment that I have come to call racial torture.  This is the stuff that does not make the front page but it should, particularly when it is not only ignored but fostered in some of this country's most esteemed institutions, institutions who love to portray themselves as supporters of diversity. It is sickening. \n\nThis week, I found myself reminiscing about the days I trained in pediatric oncology. I marvelled at the strength of the team of doctors, nurses, social workers and psychologists as they worked together to save lives of the innocent young people in their care.  Many survived. Many more did not. And no matter how experienced they were, the loss of  life was devastating every time. \n\nI imagine that this is what it must be like for the many parents, community workers, and teachers on the front lines of the racial pandemic that is the cancer plagueing all of the systems in society, devouring our young, snuffing out their potential, and robbing the world of their gifts as we rob them of the chance to simply live without the extra burden of having to prove their humanity. \n\nThe time away at the cottage was so needed. I am grateful for all of the beauty, the joy and the little miracles (like the visit from the dragnofly). I allow myself to take in every moment knowing that I am deserving. This is needed.

What should I be focusing on? What should recieve my full attention? How should those priorities line up? What should be put on the backburner for now? Seasons. They come and go and I am trying to allow for cultivation in each season to bring about the most optimal fruit for that space in time. Kids are WINNING the main focus right now. They are at the very forefront of my mind. I have a freshman and senior. Each one of them has been out of a \u201Cnormal\u201D school schedule since March 2020. Now I have the privilege of being their primary educator and developing a schedule with them that suites their needs for this season in their life. We will be working together and I intend on developing a stronger relationship with them in the process. It is not what we were planning to happen at all, but it is what it is. I believe that even though things are not as we think they should be, when life throws serious curve balls atchya, we need to be flexible and evolve to fit the need for the time.

I too am mourning 2020 for my children, but I know that overall there are bigger issues at play as we have crossed the 5 million mark of COVID cases and have reached 168k deaths. \n........\nMy hubby continues to be on the frontlines in the ER.  I\u2019m sick of COVID, but If anyone has covid fatigue, it\u2019s him. ❤️ I have questioned my parenting more times than I can count over the last 9 years.  I am soooo far from perfect (in fact sometimes teetering on DCFS-esque parenting) but I have found that sugarcoating reality just sets my kids up for disappointment down the road. We have a healthy fear of this virus, not a crippling one. Just like I make my kids wear a seatbelt in the car so they are protected if we get in an accident, I make sure my kids understand the importance of wearing a mask .... to protect themselves and just as important... to protect others.  That is what we do in a civilized society.  I am teaching my kids not to be self-centered shits who believe the world revolves around them.  I see this year as an opportunity to educate our bambinos on demonstrating optimism when faced with adversity\/challenges that are far beyond our control.  More often than not, they have risen to the challenge even when I thought they surely wouldn\u2019t. \n...\nI also have to check myself every time I get down on myself for being a shit parent. My kids have a home, they are loved, and they are fed. It could be waaaaaaay worse. We have survived and managed to stay afloat for the past 6 month with lots of tears, laughs, (alcohol), memories and and an immense amount of gratitude for our blessings and the things we often took for granted.  I have no doubt that all of you can channel your inner powers with the challenges of e-learning and demonstrate the same grace under fire we hope all our kids will have some day.  Good luck this year to all of you with kids. May they learn and grow from 2020. ❤️💪🏽 Cheers.","NumberOfLikes":130,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by AH Laser Aesthetics on August 17, 2020.

Feature! @nahlahopfe \n\nOur first goal was to encourage everyone to wear a mask to keep our community safe and to show that it feels good to wear one on so many levels! As we continue to receive beautiful messages and photos, we confirm one thing: that kindness is still one of the most nurturing traits we have as human beings. Our actions to love and protect are borne out of kindness and that is why wearing a mask is borne out of kindness. Thank you to the beautiful and compassionate Nahla Hopfe, not only for sharing the importance of masks but for doing what you already do for the community. You bring to focus the value of putting other people first and in the process, you shine through! May we all experience the joy of giving that you so happily exemplify! ❤\n\nExcerpts from Nahla's message:\n\"Thank you Jackie for initiating the amazing mission M.A.S.K. My Action Speaks of Kindness. \n\nWhat has helped me during this pressing time and always been a big part of my life is helping someone, making a difference, reaching out. I am fortunate to have always been involved in my neighborhood being the Vice president of the Douglas Park Board for 9 years and coordinator of the annual Riley Park Festival. I have been helping a number of elderly neighbors in many ways. I have also been handing out packaged food and disposal masks to people on the streets and talking to them about the importance of wearing a mask and washing hands. \n\nPlease wear a mask as an act of kindness to protect the people in your community. Let\u2019s each do our part to protect our neighbors, the elderly people who are possibly not as strong, for the immune compromised. Seeing friends and family is vital. I can\u2019t express in words how much I miss all my friends. But, we have to balance that with doing the diligent ial distancing, and washing our hands.

Whether you're on a call with a customer, creating a content or trying to balance a budget, having kids around your home office is tricky.\n\nCome up with the best plan you can and understand that it's not likely to go as smoothly as anyone would have hope. There are a few strategies you can use to make your new situation a little easier. \n\nAs a work from home mom for 7 years now, I make sure the kids are busy from the time they get up in the morning up 'till they go to bed. \n\nMy 11 and 8-year-old were given morning routines, like simply fixing their bed, brushing their teeth and cleaning the backyard. When done, they take their breakfast and by 8:30 AM, all three of them should have taken a bath and, ready for their tutor. \n\nThey also help with cooking, washing clothes and dishes and preparing the table. The youngest 3-year-old also helps in putting place-mats by the way.\n\nAfter lunch, I give them an hour to play with their gadget but they have to take a nap at 2 PM. They usually wake up at 5 or 6 PM already. I let them watch TV for an hour then help with our dinner at 7 PM. \n\nAfter dinner, we check the kids how their day went, if they learned something they didn't understand. If there's anything new they've learned today and a lot more things that will start them talking. \n\nAfter our small talk, I make sure that I give them one bedtime story then we pray and go to sleep. \n\nIt might be uncomfortable and difficult to some but keep in mind that working from home right now, even as difficult as it can be with kids-  can be the difference that keeps millions of people safe. We're all in this together. Stay safe and healthy! Have a great Tuesday!#newnormal #covid #freelancing #workfromhome #thenewnormal #socialdistancing #staysafe #coronavirus #stayhome #stayathome #corona #stayhealthy #like #lockdown #quarantine #pandemic #love #studyathome #learnfromhome #homelearning #education  #bhfyp","NumberOfLikes":4,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Rein DePedro I SocialMediaMngr on August 17, 2020.

Hundreds of feminist protesters marched through Mexico City and called for an end to impunity in cases of sexual violence and justice for victims. Police and protesters clashed in downtown Chicago during protests downtown Saturday, leaving 17 officers injured and leading to two dozen arrests. At one point, video shows a protester hitting an officer over the head with a skateboard several times. Authorities charged 25-year-old Jeremy Johnson with felony aggravated battery to an officer Sunday in connection with the incident.  The Seattle Police Department (SPD) declared an anti-police union demonstration in SODO a riot Sunday night. Three police officers were injured, and 18 people were arrested.

PESQUISA DE PROFESSOR DE STANFORD INDICA QUE SIM! (FONTE: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2CDcsTO)\n\nA maioria das pessoas é imune ao vírus da Covid, diz Karl Friston. Scott Atlas, da Hoover Institution, estima que as conseqüências do desemprego, da falta de consultas médicas e de outros fatores durante os dois meses de lockdown levarão a tantas mortes extras que os americanos perderão 1,5 milhão de anos acumulados de vida, o dobro do total perdido até o momento com a Covid-19.\n\nO renomado cientista britânico afirma que a \u201Cpopulação suscetível efetiva nunca foi 100%\". Os modelos da epidemia teriam errado ao assumir que a maioria das pessoas não tem alguma imunidade ao novo coronavírus. No Reino Unido, cerca de 80% da população não seria suscetível ao SARS-CoV-2, diz Friston\n\nEm circunstâncias normais, a maioria das pessoas nunca irá contrair a doença.\n\nNaturalmente, cenários com uma carga viral muito alta, como médicos que tratam pacientes com Covid-19 em hospitais, podem vencer essas defesas.\n\nA maior ação governamental coordenada da história, fechando à força a maioria das sociedades do mundo com consequências que podem durar gerações, teria sido baseada em ciência falha.\n\n Há apenas um mês, a ideia de que a maioria das pessoas não é suscetível ao Covid-19 seria considerada negacionismo.\n\nNo início de maio, o Professor de Stanford e Prêmio Nobel Michael Levitt afirmou à Freddie Sayers, em entrevista ao LockdownTV\/UnHerd, que as curvas de crescimento da doença nunca foram realmente exponenciais, sugerindo algum tipo de \"imunidade anterior\".\n\nHoje, porém, evidências de algum nível de resistência e imunidade anteriores à Covid-19 estão presentes em artigos publicados revisados por pares. Por exemplo, o estudo Targets of T Cell Responses to SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus in Humans with COVID-19 Disease and Unexposed Individuals, publicado em meados de maio na revista científica Cell, da Elsevier, sugere que 40% a 60% das pessoas não expostas têm resistência de outros coronavírus.\n#covid #coronavirus #corona #stayhome #quarantine #staysafe #lockdown #socialdistancing #virus #love #d #stayathome #cov #pandemic #diru","NumberOfLikes":14,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Brasil de direita 38 🇧🇷 on August 17, 2020.

What an interview!! It was almost an hour long covering YOVANNI\u2019s rise to stardom, because he is a star! Learn more about him as he was interviewed sharing with the world the beginning of his career in Miami, attending New World School of the Arts, where the musical movie, \u201CFame\u201D was filmed becoming an actor and musical artist at his residency in New York City with just $700 in following and pursuing his dreams. \n\nThe interview also included the airing of his two amazing music videos, both  released in 2020, one very controversial, \u201CPandemic\u201D narrated in his own words and personal view on how this world has gotten out of control followed by his next song, \u201CPerfect Crime\u201D videotaped, produced, directed and remixed all in his apartment with his I-Phone!! Both songs are shown in its entirety. \n\nI still can\u2019t believe how YOVANNI even put this video together with very little money. And if he had a million dollar budget, he would be right there with directors Steven Spielberg, James Cameron, Spike Lee and Ava DuVernay, an artist that only wants RESPECT as an artist. \n\nAnd when he finally passes on after living until 110 years old, his dream is for people to Google his name, being inspired with awe saying to themselves,\u201Dso this was YOVANNI, a genuine musician, the shy artist that turned into an unfearful artist who came closest to God every time he sang to the microphone on stage\u201D. \n\nHis music was embraced with pure respect and appreciation. And YOVANNI\u2019s message to everyone, \u201CFollow your dreams. Work hard. Believe in yourself. Never hide who you truly are.

We have entered a new stage in humanity, a new era in which we must be connected to each other through positive reciprocal bonds, where everyone in society acts toward others like a loving mother embracing her dear child.\u2060\n\u2060\nSuicide is the worst decision a person can take. A desperate person reaches this most extreme resolution in order to escape the pain. In the minds of those who commit such extreme acts, life becomes a burden worth getting rid of, an ordeal without satisfaction. By doing so, they disregard the pain they inflict on their family and friends and manifest complete unwillingness to accept the conditions granted by life.\u2060\n\u2060\nThey seemingly run out of strength to demand what they consider they are entitled to have in life, whatever it is. Instead of involving others to help work on finding solutions together, the suicidal person retreats into his own self-absorbed thoughts and whirlwind of emotions.\u2060\n\u2060\nWhile suicide appears to be the most personal of decisions, we carry a collective responsibility as a society for failing to create the necessary conditions for people to live healthy and happy lives. Such conditions would prevent people from reaching the ultimate state of despair, anguish and pain that takes them to the point where they feel life no longer makes sense.\u2060\n\u2060\nWe must create mechanisms of mutual responsibility to guarantee that each person\u2019s most basic needs are met in order to be sure that each person has the essentials necessary for dignified existence.\u2060\n\u2060\n#hope #covid19\u2060","NumberOfLikes":19,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Kabbalah Australia Bnei Baruch in Sydney, Australia.

Frank Lloyd] Wright\u2019s urban plan became a template for thousands of midcentury American suburbs, with their low-slung, ranch style homes and endless lawns. These suburbs, like their more idealistic ancestors, were a mess of contradictions. Supposedly democratic, they were ground zero for redlining policies. Plus, their commuter populations often depended on nearby light industries that flatlined in the 1990s. Eventually, wealthy young people fled these suburbs as urban cores bloomed in the early 2000s.\u2060⠀\n\u2060⠀\nNow the cycle has come around again, as the middle class flees cities in pandemic panic, seeking unpolluted \u2014 yet car-dependent \u2014 places. But we need to pay attention to the tragic fate of the garden cities that Howard and Wright dreamed of nearly a century ago. Ultimately, the garden city future is a false Utopia. The answer to our current problems isn\u2019t to run away from the metropolis. Instead, we need to build better social support systems for people in cities so that urban life becomes healthier, safer and more sustainable.\"\u2060⠀\n\u2060⠀\n-Annalee Newitz, writing for NYT\u2060\n\nImages:\n\n1.

They started homeschooling in the spring, when the Stay at Home mandate began. Their mom, Nat, said they quickly adapted to the Stay at Home life. \u201CWe were always on the go; Soccer, dance, school activities, we always were running. Then, we were able to just wake up and not have to go anywhere, it was nice. Events we had planned on, like preschool graduation and some parties were canceled, but they\u2019ve been completely fine with everything.\u201D\n\n\u2022\n\nThese two got really into wearing their masks, Nat talked about how masks are like accessories to them; They compare how many they each have and love when they get a new ones to fashion. Kate recently modeled masks for a local company. Kate and Ben are perfect little mask models, partially because of their love for masks but I think their experience with having a mom who is an incredibly talented photographer helps! Take a look through these images, you\u2019ll see their masks are good for chilling in your favorite camping chair after a bike ride, hugging your family, or watching airplanes! Masks are diverse for all kinds of activities.\n\n\u2022\n\nAlthough Nat wanted to make these photos more about the kids, you\u2019ll see she\u2019s pictured in the third image. Sorry, Nat! I had to sneak this shot in, there\u2019s too much love in this photo not to share it.

She discussed that this was due to the heaviness that she (and so many of us) are feeling due to the pandemic and racial injustice. \n\nToday the letter was published in the @chicagotribune (link in bio!)! Fitting for our former Chicago born and raised First Lady. The article also has a link to the names of over 200 Black female-identified #psychiatrists who endorsed it and stand in solidarity with Mrs. Obama. This letter acknowledges as well as thanks her for her vulnerability and shedding light on #mentalhealth challenges during this time. We also appreciate that she gave voice to what so many Black women are experiencing in the pandemics. By example she let Black women know that it is ok to be strong AND vulnerable. \n\nBig thanks to all my IG followers from all backgrounds, medical specialties or other professions for your help in sharing this letter and helping us amplify that - It's OK not to be OK at this time!! \n\nPics are of two of my Chicago psychiatry colleagues and collaborators on this letter and of Dr. Altha Stewart (headshot) the first black person EVER to be the president of the American Psychiatric Association.

It seems simple enough, but the tubelike GI tract, lined with a thin, sticky mucous, is embedded with millions of bacteria that live, grow, and metabolize (digesting and absorbing) in what\u2019s considered a complex ecosystem comprised of both beneficial and harmful bacteria.  This is where the importance of that 🤭 subject 💩 appears...efficiently eliminating ensures toxic waste isn\u2019t getting stuck in the ridged tubelike Tract so that we are using all the space to absorb essential nutrients properly! \n\nGut flora, and the gut barrier determine gut health. Inside the gut are about 100 trillion live microorganisms that promote normal GI function, protect the body from infection, and regulate metabolism and the mucosal immune system. In fact, they comprise more than 75% of the immune system. Also important is their role in maintaining and protecting the GI barrier. \n\nAn intact GI barrier maintains gut health, while a problem with its microbiota composition will affect the body\u2019s defense systems and can create a condition known as leaky gut syndrome, which can compromise gut health and lead to diseases such as inflammatory breast cancer, obesity, chronic fatigue syndrome, and depression. Many common autoimmune conditions, including multiple sclerosis and Crohn\u2019s disease, have roots in the gut microbiome and have been shown to respond to probiotics. skin conditions are also driven by the immune system, a \u201Cleaky\u201D gut that allows binding protein (LPS) to get into the bloodstream. Probiotic interventions have shown promise in reinforcing the gut lining, decreasing gut permeability and allowing the gut microbiome to rebalance and flourish. \n\nThere are a number of items that disrupt your microbiome and should be avoided, antibiotics, gluten, natural and artificial sugars, chlorine, home goods with BPA plastics and artificial ingredients. \nSupplementing with quality probiotic and prebiotics strains  have shown to boost immunity and help protect  from common infections like the flu and colds!","NumberOfLikes":33,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Katie Spanish in Las Vegas, Nevada.

It's embraced by Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson and #MyPillow founder and CEO Mike Lindell, a big Trump backer, who recently took a financial stake in the company that develops the product.\n_\n°Lindell told Axios that in the meeting, Trump \"basically said: \u2026'The FDA should be approving it.'\"\n\n°The White House did not respond to requests for comment.\n_\nWhy it matters: A senior administration official familiar with the internal conversations told Axios, \"The involvement of the Secretary of HUD and MyPillow.com in pushing a dubious product at the highest levels should give Americans no comfort at night about their health and safety during a raging pandemic.\"\n_\nThe big picture: It's part of a pattern in which entrepreneurs, often without rigorous vetting, push unproven products to Trump \u2014 knowing their sales pitches might catch his eye. Trump will then urge FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn to \"look at\" or speed up approval.\n_\nIn March, Trump personally lobbied Hahn to authorize hydroxychloroquine's emergency use to treat COVID-19.\nThe FDA obliged. But in June, after a large trial, the agency revoked that authorization and warned of the \"risk of heart rhythm problems\" in COVID-19 patients treated with the drug.\n_\nBehind the scenes: Senior administration officials familiar with the internal conversations around #oleandrin have raised concerns about the way this botanical extract \u2014 pushed by Andrew Whitney of Phoenix Biotechnology \u2014 is being promoted at the highest levels of the #Trump administration.\n_\nThere is no public data showing oleandrin has ever been tested in #animals or humans for its efficacy against #COVID-19.\nWHAT'S NEXT?🙄","NumberOfLikes":20,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by say.no.2.trump on August 17, 2020.

Avoid food additives, especially artificial colors and preservatives in the morning as they can exacerbate ADHD symptoms in some children. Whole, real food, is always best. \n \nSupplements:\nSome kids can also benefit from extra iron, zinc, mag, vitamin D and omegas, especially if they aren\u2019t getting enough in their diet.  Talk to your pediatrician about what supplements your child may benefit from.\n \nSleep:\nAlmost all school age kids (with and without ADHD) need at least 10 hours of sleep a night for their brain and body to function the next day at school.  Things that help are keeping room dark, cool, getting electronics out of the room.\n\nExercise:\nFor many kids exercising in the morning can actually help them sit still, focus and concentrate during the day. Afterschool exercise for 30 minutes is also a good idea and I\u2019ve seen positive changes in my patients who for example swim every day in terms of improvement in behavior, focus and concentration all day.\n \nStudy space and skills:\nHave a distraction free space in your home for virtual learning. Break up all assignments into smaller chunks.  For example instead of tackling 10 math problems, you can do one, then take a quick break for a snack or jumping jacks and then do another one.  A reward half way through or at the end can help as well.\n\nIf you\u2019ve tried all of this and your child is still having trouble with on-line learning, talk to your pediatrician, school, teacher or counselor.\n\nThere is so much we can do to help you help your child have a successful school year, even virtually!\n\n#backtoschool #virtuallearning #onlineschool #pandemic #covid19","NumberOfLikes":51,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":7,"Timestamp":1597701368,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 23:56:08 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Extraña temporada la que estamos viviendo Covid-19 cuando te irás?

What we need to think about are the rights of groups like Na­tive Amer­i­cans, il­le­gal im­mi­grants, dis­abled peo­ple, low-in­come Amer­i­cans, and the LGBTQIA com­mu­nity, just to name a few. They are the ones that are being se­verely threat­ened by an­other four years of Trump. These groups of mil­lions of peo­ple can not wait another term be­cause they are fac­ing life-threat­en­ing de­ci­sions right now. So as this is a hu­man rights is­sue, we must take mat­ters into our own hands, and vote to pro­tect the rights of our fam­ily, friends, and peo­ple who who can not vote because we are com­pas­sion­ate human be­ings. \n\nBut even if you are priv­i­leged to not be­long to any of the groups, your life is still threat­ened by Trump\u2019s elec­tion, be­cause of his fail­ure to un­der­stand sci­ence and data.

By 1:30pm or depending on after school activities I go for another school runs again. When the kids get home, feeding, lessons, therapies, play, TV time, dinner, shower before bedtime.\n\n In the midst of being a mother and home maker, I also run my organisation, Diary of A Special Needs Mum Initiative under P4:13 Foundation. This is an organisation that promotes disability inclusion in Nigeria. We organise different fun and educative events for young students to promote love and acceptance with people that have disabilities. We educate the community such as schools, churches, government, general public about disability awareness and promote acceptance. We also promote inclusive education. The organisation trains and economically empowers women who have children with special needs. My work involves a lot of counselling and I have a group of women that I mentor.\n\nLast year, I started a publishing outfit with a team of freelance editor, graphic artist, illustrator and a printing company. We are currently working on two books for our first client. I am also a writer with five published books and I am working on a couple of manuscripts.\n\nApart from this, I am a leader in church with duties and responsibilities.\n\nOne thing the pandemic did was to slow things down a great deal. It reduced the pressure of being a home maker and an entrepreneur. Even going to church on Sundays with my special needs child gives me headache. Virtual church for me right now is a blessing.\n\nHowever, virtual schooling for my special needs child had introduced another kind of pressure. I was not able to do much at my workstation because by the time I am done for the day, my creative juices are dry. At this time, I had not included my younger daughter\u2019s online classes. I knew I couldn\u2019t continue like that for long. I had to find space for me.\n\nI had a discussion with my husband about Pemi.

So I got some great news today that a client of mine who I\u2019ve done lots of business with over the years has opened back up their operations here in the Orlando area after closing down due to the Coronavirus Pandemic in March.  What they do is they will purchase a home for on your behalf that is currently on the market for sale and you can then lease from them for as many years as you like.  This is a fantastic program which has helped many families over the years who also get to have the same type of experience in looking for a home as if they were going to buy it without all of the things you need to also cover such as financing, inspections and appraisals it is all done by them. Plus there is a bonus at the end.  Give me a call and I\u2019ll tell you more about it.  407-383-4464\n \n#orlando #realestate #realtor #realtorlife  #coldwellbanker #winterparkfl #welovedogs  #leasingbuyingsellinginorlando #report #pandemic #coronavirus #listingagent #sellersagent #seller #sellyourhome #buyahome","NumberOfLikes":11,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1597695274,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 22:14:34 CEST 2020","Location":"Orlando, Florida"},{"CaptionText":"@vickyhartzler, @govparsonmo and any leader or business owner who isn\u2019t mandating masks is personally responsible for every one of these twenty-eight deaths today.

He would teach us to be afraid for nothing but the fear of God alone, in whom we should trust in all things. I understand this can be mistaken to say that \u201Cwell that must mean we shouldn\u2019t take percaution on anything then...? Where\u2019s the logic in that?\u201D God also teaches us to be biblically smart and diligent about things as well, however this pandemic and mask wearing society we are currently existing in is perpetuated by fear mongering and need for controlling our own outcomes in life. \n\nWe can\u2019t avoid the things that are a part of life, we wake up and accept that we risk hard things and even death everyday. \n\n\u201CIs not your fear of God your confidence, and the integrity of your ways your hope?\u201D\n\u202D\u202DJob\u202C \u202D4:6\u202C \u202DESV\u202C\u202C\n\nTo fear God is not the means to tremble and feel dismayed, it\u2019s to arm ourselves with the reverence for him and trust of his plans that he will uphold. The call on our lives is not our own, therefore we are not in control of any outcome, we surrender those outcomes in wake of his justice that will prevail. \n\nI do not put my hands and fate into the world and those who believe they rule it. My heart is ruled by the God who ordained me to be his ultimate image bearer and love those as his son loved me and my fellow people. \n\nI live to die for him. \n\nSo no Jesus would not be tolerant of the fear spreading around us, he would ask us to stand up and have confidence in our creator wh","NumberOfLikes":18,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Megan Elford in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Only 2% of this cost can be used to prevent further pandemics over the next decade.\n\nSpending about $260 billion over 10 years would substantially reduce the risks of another pandemic on the scale of the coronavirus outbreak, the researchers estimate. \n\nThe key programs the scientists are calling for are: much better regulation of the wildlife trade, disease surveillance and control in wild and domestic animals, ending the wild meat trade in China and cutting deforestation by 40% in key places.\n\nThere was a clear link between deforestation and virus emergence, they said, with forest bats the likely reservoirs of the Ebola, Sars and Covid-19 viruses, and tropical forest edges a \u201Cmajor launchpad\u201D for new viruses infecting humans.\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s naive to think of the Covid-19 pandemic as a once in a century event,\u201D said Prof Andrew Dobson at Princeton University in the US, who led the analysis. \u201CAs with anything we\u2019re doing to the environment, they\u2019re coming faster and faster, just like climate change.\u201D\n \nWildlife protection has to be the focus of future financial investment and current efforts are severely underfunded. Deforestation and the international trade in animals have brought humans and livestock into even greater contact with wildlife, raising the chances of pathogen transmission.\n\n#covid19 #coronavirus #pandemic #economicloss #renewableenergy #climateaction #gogreen #greenfuture #greenliving #greenenergy #sustainableenergy #alternativenergy #savethefuture #solar #wind #kineticenergy #solarenergy #windenergy #hydropower #biomass #biofuel #gorenewables #terrascale","NumberOfLikes":20,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597693750,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 21:49:10 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Turkcesi (in Turkish): \"Eger hayatin bir kitap olsaydi, kitabinin basligi ne olurdu?

We have worked tirelessly and relentlessly on eating\/feeding since the day Gracie was born. We worked ourselves into a very good routine. Cancer and chemo have smeared all that work and progress into a mess. Ever changing side effects with her appetite, ability or desire to eat day to day, meal to meal. And the intensity of those side effects wax and wane throughout each day. I can easily get stuck. Sad. Overwhelmed. Completely defeated. But then I have a day like today where I have a little more clarity and I realize all that work and progress was necessary for her to be able to thrive through this tremendous hurdle in life. It taught us everything we would ever need to know in order to face these obstacles throughout treatment. Those years of work and progress gave us tools and knowledge for handling this cancer journey. We have learned all we need to navigate things no matter what they are to ensure our girl continues to grow and thrive. I am thankful for the unpaved road. Without it, we would not be making it through this period in our lives. It has prepared us for all the unknown.

These unprecedented times have raised the social consciousness of many, so we wanted to use our last challenge to encourage us all to continue to act on that sense of care. There are many ways you can make a difference. You could use money to support local causes, such as backpack drives, small businesses, farmers markets, BLM initiatives, relief funds for tragedies abroad, etc. There is also plenty you can do without money such as: kind gestures to people, writing loving messages on the sidewalk using chalk, spreading awareness around an issue, protecting the environment by recycling\/ reusing old items, educating yourself on the policies associated with the upcoming election, etc. There are countless more ways to make a difference as well.

Add in herbs such as oregano, thyme and rosemary.\n.\n✨Stay hydrated throughout the day + add lemon for added antioxidants.\n.\n✨Support your body with supplements, especially vitamins C, A, D, zinc, a multivitamin, glutathione and probiotics.\n.\nSoak in an Epsom salt bath to boost magnesium levels.\n.\n✨Move your body. This helps the lymphatic system and blood move through the body to detox metabolic waste and deliver nutrients and oxygen where needed.\n.\n✨Cut out processed sugar because it suppresses the immune system up to 5 hours.\n.\n✨Support your gut.  70% of your immune system is found in your gut.

Everyone has their own audience. So don't let that stop you from doing something you\u2019ve always wanted to do, because a lot of people are already doing it! However, I will say that this #pandemic has been a #blessings in disguised for me. It didn't just teach me a lesson, this was the #sign I was looking for. The perfect opportunity to put my idea into context. I've taken a leap of faith, believing in myself, knowing I will do this! And for those who know me personally, always knew I had such an idea. I just didn't know how to go about it, and make it my reality. After doing all my research during #quarantine in the midst of this #pandemic, I figured it out.  I figured I want to do things the right way, so I went and got my #LLC and other important things that lets me conduct business legally.

(Yes I did the math wrong last post, forgot about the weekend🤪) Let\u2019s start with the positive...\nObviously a worldwide pandemic is never on someone\u2019s wish list, but it does make you conscious and grateful for any silver linings🌈. One of the most positive things that has come out of this predicament for us personally, is all of the amazing quality time we\u2019ve had together as a family. For the first time ever, with Tony working from home, we\u2019ve had family dinners together every single night. Tony is able to be there for the bedtime routine, where before he often missed because of his commute. Until just recently, we haven\u2019t had babysitters or even extended family helping with Ezra, so it\u2019s just been the 3 of us. It reminds me of how life must\u2019ve been like in the \u201Colden days\u201D, before the rat race and hustle and bustle. In a weird way, this is the way I first imagined motherhood to be, a little more like how my parents raised us...a slower pace, more time together, less obligations. I honestly don\u2019t think my mom ever socialized with girlfriends without the kids there or got her nails done😂\u201Dself-care\u201D was not in the vernacular in those days😜\n\nAnd although I am beyond grateful for this time of connection between the three of us during the pandemic, the other side of that coin is feeling like you\u2019ve lost your tribe, especially during a time when you need it most. Our \u201Cvillage\u201D of family and neighbors and friends who would come watch Ezra and share in the joys of watching him grow...and give me a much needed break, pregnant and tired! Like so many others, losing this feeling of community the past 5 months is definitely a mental and emotional shift. And it feels so not right to be isolated during this joyful time of welcoming another human into the world.\n\nBut despite all of that, I still am so thankful that we\u2019ve grown as a family during this time and been able to take a closer look at really matters in life, before expanding to 4. When this is all said and done, I hope I can remember to prioritize this over anything else💙It truly is the greatest gift of all! \n📸 @monkeysandpeas \nStyled by @randilynndittmer","NumberOfLikes":1173,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Selah Victor on August 17, 2020 tagging @renttherunway, @randilynndittmer, @selahvictor, and @monkeysandpeas.
