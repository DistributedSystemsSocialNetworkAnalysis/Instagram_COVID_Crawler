[{"CaptionText":"I had a delightful five-year-old ask me on tour last week if I got in trouble when I died my hair purple and pink. I had a good laugh about it then, but the question has stayed with me. While I didn\u2019t get into trouble, of course, I do wonder how long I will keep it this way. And the answer, like so many answers these days, is that I just don\u2019t know.\n.\nThe easy explanation as to why I did it is simple \u2013 why not? Nothing else makes sense right now\u2026might as well have purple and pink hair. A slightly more honest answer is that as my gray roots really started to make themselves SEEN and KNOWN they were not doing much for my brown ends. The colors were simply not getting along nicely. So, to stop the fight between brown and gray I introduced pink and purple and there has been much more hair harmony since then.\n.\nI have returned to the hair salon for cuts \u2013 I\u2019ve been twice now \u2013 but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever go back to younger-me-brunette. The gray is slowly taking over and the pink and purple are both temporary colors that slowly wash out and have to be refreshed every couple of weeks. So, someday I\u2019ll probably stop with the pink and purple and get a full-on view of the gray. A \u201Cnew me\u201D in the \u201Cnew world\u201D I\u2019m kinda excited about it, to be honest.\n.\nBut right now I like having purple and pink hair. It makes me smile. Plus, I\u2019ll always know what pictures were taken during the pandemic. And, instead of everything just FEELING different, I actually LOOK different. It feels right right now.\n.\nHope you are doing something that a five-year-old might think you\u2019d get into trouble for, but you\u2019re just doing because it makes you feel like you are doing *something* in a world where there is currently so much we can\u2019t do. Thankfully, we can get out and tour again. Let me know if you\u2019d like to! I\u2019m easy to find at our starting location \u2013 I\u2019m the one with the pink and purple hair. #purplehair #pinkhair  #pandemichair #nothingmakessense\n#newme #newworld #walkingtours #washingtondc #dcwithkids #dawnthetourguide #pandemic","NumberOfLikes":20,"Hashtags":["#purplehair","#pinkhair","#pandemichair","#nothingmakessense","#newme","#newworld","#walkingtours","#washingtondc","#dcwithkids","#dawnthetourguide","#pandemic"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Dawn Bryant in Washington D.C..

Recently, we heard of some advances in this regard... but we might still be a few months away.\n\n#COVID #COVID19 #vaccines #immunisation #health #doctor #newhope #pandemic #newvaccine #preventativehealth #prevention","NumberOfLikes":20,"Hashtags":["#COVID","#COVID19","#vaccines","#immunisation","#health","#doctor","#newhope","#pandemic","#newvaccine","#preventativehealth","#prevention"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Deb Echerman in Warrnambool, Victoria.","NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1598145231,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 03:13:51 CEST 2020","Location":"Warrnambool, Victoria"},{"CaptionText":"#justiceforgeorgefloyd #justiceforbreonnataylor #justiceforahmaud #blm #blacklivesmatter #republican #republicans #gop #conservative #conservativememes #right #rightwing #rightwingmemes #trump #trumptrainüöÇüí® #trump2020 #trump2020üá∫üá∏ #maga #maga2020 #makeamericagreatagain\n#antifa #antifascist #fucktrump #leftistmemes #democraticsocialism\n#covid19 #pandemic #thinblueline #acab","NumberOfLikes":6,"Hashtags":["#justiceforgeorgefloyd","#justiceforbreonnataylor","#justiceforahmaud","#blm","#blacklivesmatter","#republican","#republicans","#gop","#conservative","#conservativememes","#right","#rightwing","#rightwingmemes","#trump","#trumptrainüöÇüí®","#trump2020","#trump2020üá∫üá∏","#maga","#maga2020","#makeamericagreatagain","#antifa","#antifascist","#fucktrump","#leftistmemes","#democraticsocialism","#covid19","#pandemic","#thinblueline","#acab"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ALL protests matter on August 22, 2020.

Most of them are about how sooner or later complete PPEs are going to be required. Others joked about how a Power Ranger suit would work as well.

A community cannot be asked to make sacrifices if they have no confidence in their leaders or in the government.  And they also need to be informed. \n\nIn turn, the coronavirus will require the community not only to hold their leaders accountable but to take charge of the situation. \n\nIf you\u2019re unhappy about something, don\u2019t just complain about it, do something about it: \n\nVote. \nGet Informed. \nOrganize. \nSpread the Word. \nCare For One Another. \n\nAnd finally, there needs to be a measure of gratitude. \n\nTimes are rough right now, and they may get rougher still.  But things will get better. \n\nFor despite everything, we in Hawai\u2019i are fortunate enough to live in one the most beautiful places in the world! \n\nAnd there still remains a lot of good in our community. \n\nHawai\u2019i has a long way to go in order to beat the coronavirus.

It was an amazing experience especially with my other chiropractic colleagues. I was working with patients that had serious past traumas.

It really opened my eyes to what types of people out there need care!\n.\nüòçThe second photo of me shaking this patient\u2019s hand was one of the most amazing experiences. Years ago this patient fractured his whole arm & had a previous stroke that made him lose the ability to use his hand or grip. At that moment after working on him he told me to shake his hand.

The one thing that I have enjoyed about our current reality is being able to drop into several different yoga studios via Zoom. My current rotation is @mettamovesme, @samudrastudioyoga and @presence_of_mind_maine. For the first time in years, I've gotten back into a solid practice routine. In some ways, our need to #socialdistance allows for greater accessibility. I hope that is something that remains, whenever we move beyond the #pandemic.\n\nAfter class, I did some deep cleaning while listening to music. Saturday morning cleaning with music is what I grew up with and it's grounding. Afterwards, I light incense and it takes me back to my childhood.\n\n While I don't like to cook, I actually don't mind cleaning. I hate clutter and it feels so good to shower up after cleaning and just sit in the stillness of a clean house. \n\nA few minutes ago, I went out to check the tomatoes and they are coming along. I suspect I'll roast them and turn them into a sauce. Though a few fried green tomatoes would be lovely. \n\nIt's a lazy, late summer day. It almost feels normal. I guess we can create moments of normal even in the chaos. These normal moments are what keep me grounded and rooted to my truth and my own humanity. \n\nMay your day be blessed with moments of normal. #coviving #pandemicmusings #coronavirusdiarys #anewnormal #survivingduringcorona #createthelifeyouwant #home #midlifetransition #dailyreflections #dailyrythm #maineislandlife #growfood #homegarden #bgimchronicles","NumberOfLikes":454,"Hashtags":["#lifeduringapandemic","#ashtangayoga","#socialdistance","#pandemic.","#coviving","#pandemicmusings","#coronavirusdiarys","#anewnormal","#survivingduringcorona","#createthelifeyouwant","#home","#midlifetransition","#dailyreflections","#dailyrythm","#maineislandlife","#growfood","#homegarden","#bgimchronicles"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":9,"Timestamp":1598133841,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 00:04:01 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#pandemic #birthday delayed\/ advanced for everyone #cavabienaller #covid19 #2020","NumberOfLikes":1,"Hashtags":["#pandemic","#birthday","#cavabienaller","#covid19","#2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Terry on August 22, 2020.

As most of my followers will know finally after multiple losses me & my Husband finally welcomed our rainbow baby on June 27th 2020.\nüíõ\nEndometriosis is a chronic invisible illness, which leads women to be diagnosed 10+ years  too late. For me this was the case as in 2017 I was diagnosed and by then it was too late causing fertility issues. I had to have multiple surgeries as you can swipe on to see to try clearing out the endometriosis. But anyone who knows this disease it quickly returns after a few weeks - THEIR IS NO CURE.\n\n1 in 4 has suffered a loss of a pregnancy. Whether like me due to gynaecology issues or due to unknown reasons. It is seen as a taboo subject in our society that women must not or will not openly speak about. And sadly I was one of these women.\n\nToday is the day we celebrate & share our own personal stories of our rainbow babies. Loosing a baby is one of the hardest things any women can experience. You pray it won\u2019t happen again & you blame yourself what could of been done to have prevented it.\n\nAt the time I believed my body wasn\u2019t able to do this, I believed I wasn\u2019t like other women. I changed my diet, I lost weight I was up to date on my surgical procedures, in my head their was nothing else I could do. Continuously I\u2019d ask myself why can\u2019t MY body do what other WOMENS do so EASILY?? After the third loss I dismissed the whole topic I slowly began to believe I\u2019d never be able to have a successful pregnancy and that\u2019s when our rainbow baby came & saved my life.\n\nIf only my son knows the journey me and his daddy went though and how grateful for his life we are. I am so in love with him, I thank Allah everyday for this blessing. \n\nBut even though we remember our sad pasts today we celebrate those rainbow babies - please let us not forget the women & couples who are told they can never have a child. My hearts go out to you the most.\n\n#firsttimemum #babyboy #endometriosis #brestfeeding #partialmolarpregnancy #pregnancyjourney #newborn #newbornshoot #pandemic #miriclebaby #baby #babyfever #breastfeeding #rainbowbaby #rainbowbabyday\n\n#birth","NumberOfLikes":30,"Hashtags":["#firsttimemum","#babyboy","#endometriosis","#brestfeeding","#partialmolarpregnancy","#pregnancyjourney","#newborn","#newbornshoot","#pandemic","#miriclebaby","#baby","#babyfever","#breastfeeding","#rainbowbaby","#rainbowbabyday","#birth"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The_Endo_A_Chapter on August 22, 2020.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598130306,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 23:05:06 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Durning this unprecedented time small businesses are suffering and need your support. \n‚ö†Ô∏è ITS COMPLETELY FREE to support a small business. ‚ö†Ô∏è \nYou can like, share, comment, repost and or follow small shops to spread the word. \nTo show my support for small shops I\u2019ll be donating 10% of all my profits to different small businesses in my area who need it most till the end of 2020. \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n. \n#supportsmallbusiness #supportsmallbusinesses #supportsmall #supportsmallbiz #supportsmallshops #standwithsmall #standwithsmalletsy #standwithlocal #supportlocal #supportlocalbusiness #supportmakers #supporthandmade #supporthandmadegoods #follow #likeit #share #repost #browardcounty #broward #browardsmallbusiness #browardfl #coralspringsfl #coralsprings #parkland #northlauderdale #soflo #southflorida #pandemic #pandemic2020 #covid19","NumberOfLikes":6,"Hashtags":["#supportsmallbusiness","#supportsmallbusinesses","#supportsmall","#supportsmallbiz","#supportsmallshops","#standwithsmall","#standwithsmalletsy","#standwithlocal","#supportlocal","#supportlocalbusiness","#supportmakers","#supporthandmade","#supporthandmadegoods","#follow","#likeit","#share","#repost","#browardcounty","#broward","#browardsmallbusiness","#browardfl","#coralspringsfl","#coralsprings","#parkland","#northlauderdale","#soflo","#southflorida","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#covid19"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ùïéùï†ùï†ùïï ùïÉùïíùïßùïí ùîæùïñùïû in Broward County, Florida.

A moment in which I experienced eternity, a moment in which I felt whole. I sank into the unfathomable pool of emotions. It was as if the hues were calling out my name, and the whole sky was embracing me. As it got darker, the moon shone brighter and I couldn't do anything but stand in my balcony awestruck, admiring this perfect beauty. I don't know what to do with this feeling but share it.\n\nI've had the hardest couple of months. I've felt lost, isolated, lonely and cold. Everything has been on a standstill for me but nature has been on the go. I've seen the most beautiful sunsets, the most beautiful skies, the most beautiful clouds, and the happiest of birds. The sharp contrast between my entrapped life and the wandering clouds and chirpy birds confused me. It was as if all that was false, everything human, was shattering and the truth was flowering. Everything true, everything which was connected to the divine, everything we ignored all this time, was the brightest. The sky is one such thing that kept me close to life. Its palette was different every day and brought to me change on the most monotonous days. Even when I was surrounded by the same four walls, it helped me see things with new eyes every single day. When I had nothing to look up to, it made me fall in love with its magnificent view. It absorbed all my anger and dissolved my anxieties into its hues. It filled me with hope when I was the most helpless and gave me strength when I couldn't function. It helped me smile on the gravest of days. And gave me goosebumps when I couldn't feel. The sky and all its components have blessed me and kept me moving forward day after day. When the phone didn't help, games felt boring and I felt exhausted, it stirred me with its impeccable beauty. I'll never forget all that it has taught me. I'm forever gonna bow down to this heavenly beauty, no matter where I am and what I'm doing. I'm always gonna take out time to connect with the divine because now I know, when everything shatters down, it is nature that lifts you up and gets you moving. It's these small unimportant but so immensely important bits of life which set you free.","NumberOfLikes":61,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":12,"Timestamp":1598129622,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 22:53:42 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"MeÃÇme aÃÄ la ferme!\n.\n\n#covid_19 #distanciationsociale #poules #farm #farmlife #familyfarm #dairyfarm #consignes #staysafe #security #pandemic #pandemic2020 #campagne #vierurale #cloudysky #crisesanitaire #pandemy #deÃÅconfinement #vacances #prudence #staysafe #2m #6foot #poulespondeuses #green #nature #bienetreanimal #crueltyfree #oeufs #animal #animaux","NumberOfLikes":8,"Hashtags":["#covid_19","#distanciationsociale","#poules","#farm","#farmlife","#familyfarm","#dairyfarm","#consignes","#staysafe","#security","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#campagne","#vierurale","#cloudysky","#crisesanitaire","#pandemy","#deÃÅconfinement","#vacances","#prudence","#staysafe","#2m","#6foot","#poulespondeuses","#green","#nature","#bienetreanimal","#crueltyfree","#oeufs","#animal","#animaux"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ùöÇùöéÃÅùöãùöäùöúùöùùöíùöéùöó ùô≤ùöäùöõùöòùöó in Dosquet, Quebec.

The plan was for C4 to then get that same one on one time with me once she started. But then Covid hit and all of us began to stay home. And my attention was pulled between the two of them. I have definitely carried my share of mom guilt when it comes to C4, feeling that he hasn\u2019t received as much as Eleanor did.

It made parents appreciate teachers and the public appreciate the NHS, and some tapped into gifts and talents they didn\u2019t even know they had. But what can we gain from this time?

The company was founded in the 1980s by a group of planners and economists from the Department of City and Regional Planning at UC Berkeley. According to the company website, they\u2019ve specialized in exploring the economic development opportunities that emerge from improving environmental quality.\n\nThe biggest overall takeaway from the report is that the legal cannabis industry continues to show significant market potential for additional legal sales throughout California.\n\nBut local #governments have proven their own worst enemy in the past. Roughly 75% of cities continue to ban access to legal marijuana by local decry according to Weedmaps\u2019 data. And the only way to capture much of the lost revenue is if the number of retail cannabis establishments expands to meet local demand in those communities that do not currently have legal retail cannabis sales.\n-\n\u201CThe state\u2019s underperforming retail cannabis market, the range of potential market support has significant upside. The market demand already exists, with most of the demand currently met through illicit sales channels that generate no tax revenues,\u201D the report\u2019s authors noted in an announcement. One of the points of hope for the market is California\u2019s cannabis tax receipts totaled over $635 million in 2019, certainly a big jump from the $397 million collected in 2018.\n-\nContinued in Comments","NumberOfLikes":242,"Hashtags":["#cannabis","#pandemic.","#Local","#bans","#retail","#entrepreneurs","#California","#Prop64,\u201D","#governments"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by üåê Beard Bros Pharms‚Ñ¢üåê in Los Angeles, California with @laweekly, @thejimidevine, and @beardbros_pharms.

Fentanyl is an opioid that is 100 times more powerful than morphine. Fentanyl is increasingly being found in the majority of street drugs, and used to make tablets appear to be prescription drugs. \n\nMany overdoses are occurring because people were not aware that what they were consuming was contaminated with fentanyl. \n\nFentanyl is toxic at very low dosage and the smallest amount can cause fatal overdose. Detectives urge the public to be safe and aware. If you suspect someone may be experiencing an overdose, IMMEDIATELY CALL 911. \n\nSigns of an Overdose:\n\nSlow or shallow breathing\nDizziness or confusion\nCold or clammy skin\nVomiting or gurgling\nBlue lips and\/or fingernails\nNot responsive or sleeping and cannot be woken up\nDeep gurgling or rattling snore\n\nIf you have any information about individuals dealing these harmful substances, please contact the J-Team at the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff\u2019s Station.

The painting shows Death riding on a bat-like winged creature, who travels through the street of a medieval European town.\n\nPlague is rendered mostly using shades of pale green, a colour often associated with decomposition. The other predominant tones are black and dull browns; for example, in the clothes worn by the figures shown in the mid and background as they dive for safety before Death's path.

What Unfriended did was pretty original but it lacked execution and I just wasn\u2019t that impressed. Host on the other hand somehow manages to impresses me with its filmmaking. Host is actually a really fucking good movie. It centres around these six friends who summon a demonic spirit during an online seance. The whole film is shot on iPhones and laptops and was actually filmed during the pandemic. They give little nods in the beginning of the whole pandemic which I thought was a really cool detail to add and explains why they chose to do this seance online rather than in person. The movie is also incredibly short. Runs at 56 minutes which is really a short in a way but this worked for me so well. It wasn\u2019t dragged on for another 20 minutes. This is the length the film needed to be and to my my surprise this is probably the scariest film I\u2019ve seen in all of 2020. It\u2019s incredibly √≠nstense and doesn\u2019t utilize jump scares as much for its scares. It utilizes the characters laptops and phones to capture the scare as if you\u2019re actually there with them in the zoom call watching it go down with them. The film is very quiet when it needs to be and when it is thats when its scariest. I\u2019m incredibly impressed with how this film was executed. They filmed this movie with their laptops and phones and they managed to pull off big scare set pieces with people being pulled across rooms, people flying through the air outside and landing in pools, people being lit on fire, cabinets and chairs flying all over the rooms, it\u2019s impressive. It was well executed and very terrifying. I recommend y\u2019all give this a try. Download Shudder and get the free trial and just watch it.

It\u2019s about the question of how God can be good when bad things happen. \n\nJob is an incredibly virtuous man and has a great life. He is the richest man in the world and has a big family with lots of kids.\n\nSatan says to God, \u2018That guy Job? Sure, he\u2019s the most righteous man, but the only reason he\u2019s good is because you\u2019ve given him tons of stuff.\u2019\n\nGod replies, \u2018You can take it all away from him because I promise he\u2019s actually a good person and he\u2019s not going to start hating me.\u2019\n\nSo Satan does just that. One by one, messengers come to tell Job that all his kids have died, all his sheep were stolen, et cetera. He ends up losing everything. \n\nJob doesn\u2019t understand why this is happening to him, but he maintains his faith in God. His friends try to convince him that it must be his fault and that God is punishing him, but Job never turns his back on God.\n\nEventually, God responds and says, \u2018Nope, it\u2019s not Job\u2019s fault. You all weren\u2019t there when I created the universe and you couldn\u2019t possibly comprehend my plan for the world. You just have to trust me when I promise that it will all work out.\u2019 Then Job has a happy ending where he gets everything back.\u201D","NumberOfLikes":45,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Lindsay Athena Wang on August 22, 2020 tagging @adultish.cambino.

George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, Toyin Salau, Layleen Xtravangaza, Ahmaud Arbery, and all that floated in this wave of visible death are reminders of how far we are from the change we need. We have been born and bred through a history of violence which beckons reckoning. The systems which have so long destroyed us, need be destroyed.

I know everyone\u2019s situation is different but here\u2019s what worked for us:\n\n1) Have a dedicated learning spot. We had a small table and chairs already, so I had the kids help me hang up educational posters and set up our rolling drawer cart. We make sure to clean the learning space daily as it doubles our play room.\n\n2) Make and set a routine. Routines can be hard with kids, especially if you don\u2019t HAVE to brush your teeth for school üôÉ We all eat breakfast together, go upstairs to get dressed, make beds and brush our teeth at the same time and get ready for the day together. \n\n3) No morning screen time. My kids are early risers, they always have been. During the school year I have a strict no TV on school mornings policy and it makes everything so much easier. It was easy to do last year when we had to be out the door by 7:25am but this year, Zoom class doesn\u2019t start until 8:30 so it\u2019s definitely something I have to stick to my rules with. It\u2019s also nice because I don\u2019t feel guilty on the weekends when they watch TV in the mornings.\n\n4) Make it fun and include everyone! This is definitely something that can be adjusted based on your specific situation. I have an almost 3 year old and my Kindergartener. I don\u2019t want my 3 year old watching TV all morning so we include her in the Zoom calls. She listens and dances along with all the kids. I love it because we spend the learning time together and she\u2019s learning Kindergarten curriculum at 3 years old, win win.\n\nI hope these tips help, especially if you are struggling to find what works for you. We are all in this crazy time together and trying to survive. Remember you are an awesome mom\/dad that is doing the best you can. Your kids will remember the time you spent with them, not all the stressors ‚ù§Ô∏è What were some things that worked or didn\u2019t work for you this week?

It\u2019s offering a \u2018teeny\u2019 glimpse of what the practical limitation of life with chronic illness are like. Call it lockdown, quarantine, or simply being housebound... it\u2019s all the same in reality when you can\u2019t access services.\nÔªø\nÔªøWe have to push and grit our teeth to even \u2018attempt\u2019 to access them.
