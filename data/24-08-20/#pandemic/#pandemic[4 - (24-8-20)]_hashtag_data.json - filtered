When we choose to share our gifts of goodness and kindness with those around us, especially the ones who need it the most, we experience life\u2019s rewards and fulfilment, in the true sense of the word. \n\nRani Shankar, from Kerala set a fine example of this. Rani and her husband owned four goats, and looked after them as their own children. At the beginning of the lockdown, Rani was running errands and came across some children sucking on eucalyptus leaves. Startled at their plight, she decided she needed to alleviate their pain and told them she would bring them food. In a life where Rani and her husband were struggling to make ends meet, Rani went out of her way to think of the plight of these hungry children. With a heavy heart, she sold one of her goats for a meagre sum of \u20B920,000 and with the money she received, rented utensils from a caterer and began cooking. For a week, she delivered the meals twice a day to the 65 migrants. \n\nSoon enough, she ran out of money but wanted to find a way to continue her efforts. A friend introduced her to Warrior For Hungers, an initiative to connect people who wanted to contribute funds and food items, especially for migrant labourers. The team visited Rani and all the people she\u2019d been cooking for and, in addition to directing resources their way, they hired Rani as local coordinator at a fixed salary.\n\nGood Vibes salutes Rani\u2019s efforts and her will to help and lift those in need. She chose to go out of her way and do good and the universe rewarded her in return, with a lifelong method of helping those in need. She is inspiring, and has truly shown how grace and kindness save the day for us, and where there is a will to be good, there is always a way.\n\n#goodvibes #goodvibesonly #goodvibesdiaries #goodvibesquotes #coronavirus #vibes #mankind #humanity #covid19 #actsofkindness #together #kindness #bekind #kindnessmatters #pandemic #quote #quoteoftheday #quotestoliveby #quotestagram #stayhome #staysafe #quarantine #quarantineandchill #quarantinelife #stayhealthy #stayhomestaysafe","NumberOfLikes":961,"Hashtags":["#goodvibes","#goodvibesonly","#goodvibesdiaries","#goodvibesquotes","#coronavirus","#vibes","#mankind","#humanity","#covid19","#actsofkindness","#together","#kindness","#bekind","#kindnessmatters","#pandemic","#quote","#quoteoftheday","#quotestoliveby","#quotestagram","#stayhome","#staysafe","#quarantine","#quarantineandchill","#quarantinelife","#stayhealthy","#stayhomestaysafe"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1598101458,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 15:04:18 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"We're seeing plenty of our community making good use of their fabric scraps, and today's sewing inspiration is an example of just that! üßµ‚úÇ @petticoatsandpolkadots sewed this face-covering from cute fabric that had been carefully saved for later - and what a good way to use it up!

None of us would be where we are without you helping shape our minds. \n\nTeachers, without those two elements met (education and basic human needs), it is difficult to provoke necessary change that can enable society to move forward together. \n\nhttps:\/\/www.nobelprize.org\/prizes\/peace\/2014\/yousafzai\/26074-malala-yousafzai-nobel-lecture-2014\/\n\n#educate #equality #stopthedivision #BecauseScience #JentheFoodScientist #SafeFoodEnRoute #MalalaYousafzai #WomenWarriors #Teachers #YouMakeADifference #OurBusinessIsToHelpYourBusiness #LoveYourself #WomeninHistory #IamWoman #HearMeRoar \n\nhttps:\/\/www.nobelprize.org\/prizes\/peace\/2014\/yousafzai\/26074-malala-yousafzai-nobel-lecture-2014\/","NumberOfLikes":3,"Hashtags":["#womaninhistory","#education","#teachers","#pandemic.","#educate","#equality","#stopthedivision","#BecauseScience","#JentheFoodScientist","#SafeFoodEnRoute","#MalalaYousafzai","#WomenWarriors","#Teachers","#YouMakeADifference","#OurBusinessIsToHelpYourBusiness","#LoveYourself","#WomeninHistory","#IamWoman","#HearMeRoar"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Safe Food En Route, LLC on August 22, 2020.

EFT is often referred to as a type of psychological acupuncture in which no needles are used. EFT targets the underlying cause of a current problem. \n\nSince all my clinics went online in March I have been using EFT a lot - it works really well over video or telephone. So I wanted to delve deeper and develop my skills for those complex issues and long standing problems clients and patients often get stuck on. \n\nI\u2019ve just completed my Advanced Level 3 Practitioner training with master trainer @taniaaprince so I can work towards Level 3 accreditation with EFT International.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to know what the root of a problem is in order to heal it. With EFT you can start with the problem and uncover deeper aspects while you work on it. It is possible to fully heal some problems without ever knowing exactly where they came from. Some of our \u2018cornerstone events\u2019 may be from our childhood that we don\u2019t remember, or from our time in the womb or even passed down through previous generations.\n\nPeople are often shocked at the progress they make and I\u2019ve been told it\u2019s magic more than once!

He tested positive for the coronavirus towards the end of July. He recounts that fateful day when he got the call from a health centre. He said that his friends were with him at that time. He was called three times and when the person in the line said his swab test was positive, he got nervous. His friends dismissed it and told him that it might be a prank call. Another friend told him that he saw a post on social media where his name was listed as one of the people who tested positive. This private information was leaked to the public. When he was approached by officials if he wanted to reveal his identity to aid in contact tracing, he agreed. Jay didn\u2019t inform his family about the result of the test. While his sister found out through the leaked information via social media, Jay kept it secret from his parents, fearing that they will worry for him. The only time his parents knew that he had to be brought to an isolation unit was when he was already fit to be discharged.

Murmu writes.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has devastated many lives and livelihoods around the world, but in India, the challenges have perhaps been the most formidable to its health system and its workers. Prime Minister Narendra Modi underscored this when he announced a complete lockdown across the country on March 24 and said, \u201CThink about the doctors, nurses, paramedical staff, pathologists who are working day and night in hospitals to save each and every life. Think about hospital administration staff, ambulance drivers, ward boys, sanitation workers who are working to serve others in these difficult condition.\u201D He also asked for the people to pray for personnel engaged in the delivery of essential and emergency services (e.g. police, fire service, garbage collectors, etc.).\n\nIn fact, the Centre on April 21 launched a portal \u2013 at covidwarriors.gov.in \u2013 to maintain a database of healthcare professionals and volunteers, including ASHA workers and anganwadi workers, and claimed 1.24 crore such individuals were available in the country. The portal is meant to help local administrations and state governments tackle COVID-19. The number of infected and killed workers could be extrapolated from the COVID-19 positivity and fatality rates respectively.

Darker nights. Cooler breeze. Leaves starting to fall off the trees.\n\nWhilst there were many fortunate people who escaped or recovered well from the last winter wave of Corona Virus, and there were many people who found lockdown cathartic or are even questioning the truth of the virus pandemic; there were and still are, many, many thousands of people who did suffer, and are truly struggling to survive right now.\n\nGive a moment to be grateful for your health and pray that other countries and fellow humans, get the help they need to battle this situation.\n\n\"A number of European countries are also seeing rises.\nPoland and Slovakia both announced record new daily infections on Friday, with 903 and 123 cases respectively, while Spain and France have seen dramatic increases in recent days.\n\nIn Lebanon, a 2 week partial lockdown - including a night time curfew - has come into effect, as the country saw its highest number of cases since the pandemic began.\n\nInfections have doubled since a devastating blast in the capital Beirut killed at least 178 people and injured thousands more on 4 August.\nThe disaster left an estimated 300,000 people homeless and placed massive strain on medical facilities.\"\n( https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/amp\/world-53870798 )\n\nHow sad.  Our hearts go out to those poor families. \n\nTake extra Vitamin C from now on, wash your hands regularly (with HOT soapy water) and take Echinacea on first signs of weakness in your immune system.  Gargle every morning and evening with salt water.  Eat well and sleep 1 hour at least before midnight.  This will support your immune system and give you a fighting chance at beating colds and flu viruses.\n\nDon't have fear.

I\u2019m Dr Kotadiya. My current specialization - final year Resident pursuing MD Immunohematology and Transfusion Medicine.\n\n- How have I been affected by the current COVID-19 pandemic? \n\nThe biggest aspect of my speciality is blood and platelet donation, and no matter what the situation or which hospital you work for, it can't ever be sidelined. It is of paramount importance especially in tertiary care centres all over the globe. But in times like these where there's a lockdown in place and people are paranoid about stepping out of their homes, it becomes all the more difficult to get adequate healthy donors, let alone have outdoor blood drives which would otherwise give us majority of our hospital's blood supply. With meagre donations and desperate strategies which keep altering every other day, this phase of COVID-19 pandemic has been a rollercoaster of sorts. Plus, to manage an infant at home (yes, I'm a mom to a year old boy) with elderly parents has been incredibly challenging and dangerous with the impending risks I bring home from work. Nonetheless, the aspirations to do right by my oath and profession keeps me going, with the sole hope that this phase, too, shall pass and pray that better days come soon!\nAlso, I'm also a Motivational speaker, the Editor of 'Times of Youth', an International Youth e-magazine, and Share to Aware-Health (www.sharetoaware.com). To juggle it all requires strength par excellence, but the prayers and smiles I get from the good souls globally at the end of the day makes it all easy and worthwhile!\u2019\u2022\n\u2022\n#doctor #doctorsofinstagram #resident #residency #immunology #heamatology #immunohematology #transfusionmedicine #studies #learning #pandemic #covid19\n#blood #blooddonations #positivity #positivevibes #mother #children #parents #motivation #motivationalspeaker","NumberOfLikes":53,"Hashtags":["#doctor","#doctorsofinstagram","#resident","#residency","#immunology","#heamatology","#immunohematology","#transfusionmedicine","#studies","#learning","#pandemic","#covid19","#blood","#blooddonations","#positivity","#positivevibes","#mother","#children","#parents","#motivation","#motivationalspeaker"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Doctor Positivity on August 21, 2020 tagging @dr.aafreen.kotadiya_official.

Maya who was the greatest of teachers to our children & taught lessons of compassion, empathy, divinity, selflessness, & love.\n\nüíõMaya & Roo... the two precious day old ducklings we brought home from the market where they were going for meat. We didn\u2019t eat them though. I cooked for them instead. \n\nüíõMaya & Roo -They would hold out on lettuce because they knew peas were coming; they lived for watermelon season & were hysterical together. \n\nI watched Roo process Maya\u2019s death. She stayed back while the others tried to coax Maya to get up by lifting her neck. But not Roo. \nShe watched from afar. \n\nI felt her pain & likened it to the great loss I\u2019ve experienced in my own life. \nI get it Roo & we\u2019ll hold space for you. \n\nWe buried Maya by the pond. \nüíõ\n\nMy hot tears told me that it was more than just about Maya though. I love all of my animals & am dedicated to each of them; as much as I would be to you if you ever needed me. The ache in my heart felt like I was saying goodbye to something more though. \n\nGoodbye to my life the way I knew it a few short months ago; to friends who cannot put differences aside;  to family members who\u2019ve gone to walk a different path; to society members who feed into divisiveness & hate; to lost opportunities; tears for the pain & suffering inflicted upon people as a result of this pandemic; for the narrative we\u2019re being served; & to what they\u2019re doing to the children. \n\nSuch a deep loss over Maya, but so much more. People logically see that we have to create a new way of being, but we still have to say goodbye to what was.  It\u2019s hard saying goodbye to the old, especially if you\u2019ve been forced to. \n\nTell me that it\u2019s just a duck, & I\u2019ll tell you you\u2019re wrong. \n\nIt\u2019s love, & love comes from the same place in your body... your heart-whether it\u2019s for a duck, a dog, a bunny or a friend.

Working on projects despite not knowing what the future holds is a test of patience. To keep smiling despite losing close friends and family in the last few months and seeing many more suffering and not knowing how many more tragedies await ahead is a test of self preservation.

This #pandemic is part of a larger scheme of things, and the evils that be are using this as a way to continue to oppress, particularly children in not getting the proper #knowledge that they need. Not that children are actually getting the proper knowledge. And that is also a different topic of conversation. This post is to show love to all the parents who are basically #homeschooling their children. To remind you to stay calm and be patient. To take breaks along with your children. Eat well, sleep well, stay active. To co-parent responsibly and in a healthy manner so the children don\u2019t experience more stress. To make the learning process fun. To reach out for help when you need it. Some families have two parents. One may not have to work. Some families have a single parent who must work. Some children may have no one at all and end up falling through the cracks. And my empathy feels for all of this. So be loving, be thankful, be grateful and be supportive.  #love #live #life #laugh #smile #happy #blessed  #myhearts #myboys #momofboys #momofmelanin #raisingkings #queen #goddess #truth #knowledge #power #asset #bossbabe #strength #peace #nutrition #health #vegan #plantbased #divinefemininity #maternal #unfuckwithable","NumberOfLikes":35,"Hashtags":["#pandemic","#knowledge","#homeschooling","#love","#live","#life","#laugh","#smile","#happy","#blessed","#myhearts","#myboys","#momofboys","#momofmelanin","#raisingkings","#queen","#goddess","#truth","#knowledge","#power","#asset","#bossbabe","#strength","#peace","#nutrition","#health","#vegan","#plantbased","#divinefemininity","#maternal","#unfuckwithable"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Shannon on August 21, 2020.

Someone in 1910, for example, would have a very different idea about how much living space was necessary than we do today. But while the average new home generally gets bigger over time \u2013 it grew by about 1,000 square feet between 1970 and 2015 \u2013 in recent years, it\u2019s started to level off. In fact, according to a new analysis from the National Association of Home Builders, the average square footage of a new single-family home fell to 2,458 square feet during the second quarter of this year. By comparison, it was at an all-time high of 2,687 square feet five years ago. So what\u2019s happening? Well, it\u2019s pretty simple actually. Following the housing crash and financial crisis, high-end home buyers returned to the market first, driving average home size higher. As the economy recovered, however, there was a greater need for smaller, more affordable homes. So, home builders have been focused on adding entry-level inventory to the market. That\u2019s caused average home size to dip in recent years. But while new homes have been getting smaller over the past few years, the NAHB expects the pandemic to shift buyer preferences and cause homes to start growing larger again in the near future.\n\n#covid_19 #coronavirus #covid19 #pandemic #sellyourhome #sellers #homesales #newhome #realestateagent #curbappeal #interiordesign #interiordesigner #luxuryhomes #evhoustonchallenge #explorepage #wishlist #htown #htx #houston #houstonhomes #size #homesforsale","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#covid_19","#coronavirus","#covid19","#pandemic","#sellyourhome","#sellers","#homesales","#newhome","#realestateagent","#curbappeal","#interiordesign","#interiordesigner","#luxuryhomes","#evhoustonchallenge","#explorepage","#wishlist","#htown","#htx","#houston","#houstonhomes","#size","#homesforsale"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Terri Garcia on August 21, 2020.

If anything, if they are 'listening' they #Dont hear what the other person is saying. All the time they hear what they think you should be saying or they hear what is in their own head, or what they want to hear but not really what you are saying.\n\nI am saying, I have been searching for one that can listen, my entire life, I am yet to find any. Zero!!\n\nI got concerned. I went a head to observe and I noticed that people who don't listen to others are technically projecting what they are doing to themselves. They are not listening to themselves. They are not listening to what their conscience is telling them. People are not listening to their feelings, their emotions. Their heartbeat. What their body is telling them. And even how they are breathing.\n\nI also observed that, since people can not hear others, which was an indicator of their inability to hear themselves, THEY LITERALLY CAN NOT HEAR GOD.\n\nWe are so deaf that I really FEEL FOR GOD. Because however way he shouts to the more we are blocking on him.\n\nFrom my life experiences I have learnt that GOD SPEAKS LOUDEST through the deepest pains --most times, we block on listen to what he is saying and instead, we turn on Him and start venting and lamenting. That way, we never learning anything. And so, until we face 'it' with grace, 'it' stays in our FACE.","NumberOfLikes":16,"Hashtags":["#Dont"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Diana Ingasiani on August 21, 2020.

Worst cramping was last night, which is what prompted me to schedule the appointment. Thankful to see baby and she is healthy. Cervical length was 54mm, good amniotic fluid level, and good fetal heart rate. However, I have a placenta previa , not completely, but it\u2019s on the posterior aspect of cervix. They are going to do an ultrasound in 4 weeks to see if it has moved with uterus stretching. If not, we will have to talk about a C-section. Being in OB, knowledge is power, but it\u2019s also thinking you have everything under the sun. They did a pelvic exam, which she said my cervix looked friable. I had them run BV and yeast cultures. BV can also induce premature labor and cause spotting. I\u2019m glad I went and advocated for myself. I have been told to do bed rest when possible and no exercise.  Have to abstain from intercourse until they can reassess. Just being as transparent as possible. \nüôèüèΩ\nEnd-thoughts: Please pray this resolves on its own and that she gets into a good position for delivery.

Yaitu, to inform (menginformasikan), to educate (mendidik), to entertain (menghibur), to influence (mempengaruhi).

Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye turns to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.\u201D\n.\nIn Erin Morgenstern\u2019s Starless Sea earlier this year I found a softer response. I like it too:\n.\n\u201CShe is young enough to carry fear with her without letting it into her heart. Without being scared. She wears her fear lightly, like a veil, aware that there are dangers but letting the crackling awareness hover around her. It does not sink in, it buzzes in excitement like a swarm of invisible bees.\u201D\n.\nFear is many things. But it is not my master. With the pandemic and my new stomach issue at present I am constantly managing the fear. But I manage it. I let it pass. I let it hum like bees.
