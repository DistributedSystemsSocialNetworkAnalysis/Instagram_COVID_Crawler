Mereka memiliki privasi dan rahasia tersendiri. Banyak hal yang mereka sembunyikan dari dunia luar, perlu berbelit-belit untuk mencari tahu tentang kesukaan mereka, idola mereka, dan banyak hal tentangnya. Jalan paling cepat mengetahui tentang diri perempuan adalah menggali informasi dari teman dekat atau kelopoknya.\n.\nKata-kata yang muncul ketika telah terpojok untuk membocorkan informasi dirinya adalah: \"tapi jagan bilang siapa-siapa ya?\".\n.\nPada diri anak perempuan yang harus diperhatikan adalah persoalan rasa dan pengertian.

The lawsuit alleges that changes made by Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, which include eliminating overtime and prohibiting late deliveries, are unlawful, both because he did not follow the legal procedure established by Congress to make changes to the service and because the consequences of the changes violate federal laws by disenfranchising voters and harming people with disabilities, among other alleged violations. The changes have led to delays in mail deliveries, throwing into question whether USPS can handle the expected increase in mail-in ballots this November as voters look for an alternative to in-person voting during the coronavirus pandemic. DeJoy has since said policy changes to the U.S. Postal Service will be suspended until after the general election in November, but Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum (@ellen.rosenblum ) announced Tuesday that Oregon will still join other states in suing the Trump administration.

Next a batter was made similar to a funnel cake or pancake batter. The chef mixed the two together and fried it up. Flipping only once. This treat reminded me of potato latke.

That may be a letter, tweet, Facebook post or a mention in the local news. \n \nAnd, when that message arrives, some are in the form of a one-sentence statement that a case has been confirmed. Period. Others explain a bit more that it was a student, teacher or staff member and the number of close contacts who are also quarantining.  \n\nKnow of a school with cases that isn\u2019t on the map?

This will be a story of evolution, growth and what it means to stay proud as we approach the dawn of a new era in our collective queer experience. \n***\n\n#dtlaproud #covid19 #racialinjustice #unityincommunity #unidadencomunidad #lgbtq #dtlaproudfestival #pride2020 #dtla #losangeles #lgbtqpride #lgbtqcommunity #lgbtqstories #bythecommunityforthecommunity","NumberOfLikes":144,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Jimmy Page Films in Downtown Los Angeles with @oliverdtla, and @dtlaproud.

You're exactly my target demographic. I have seen SO MANY Covid-19 deniers on the internet and argued with a few of them in the last few days. And there seems to be more of them all the time. \n\nThey always parrot out the same shit. That we are sheep. That they are free thinkers (so obviously superior). That Bill Gates is microchipping us with vaccinations. That masks are pointless. 5G is bad.  They use the word scam a lot which seems ridiculous to me. I don't see anybody winning out of this. Worldwide recession eh 🥇 we're WINNING\n\nBut yes, please don't let people get away with this crap. They are risking our lives. It just takes one twat to wander into a pub with symptoms for it to spread to potentially tens of families.\n\nIf you have an exemption from wearing a mask, sure. I'm not going to argue or judge you. I have asthma and I really struggle with a mask at times too. But I persist because I CARE about other human beings (again, not judging you if you have a genuine medical reason). I don't like this new normal but if the worst part of my day is that I have to briefly wear a bit of cloth on my face then WOOP DE DOO. I've obviously got it really hard. 🙄 I also have to take immunosuppressants so I'm at extra risk of complications if I were to catch anything. \n\nEven if this IS some giant made up hoax - which it definitely isn't- I'd rather stand on the other side of this knowing I did my part to help public health for the good of my community. These people? They only care about themselves. And that makes them pretty shit people in my books. \n\nThe longer you don't wear the damn mask and flaunt your god given 'rights' to not pay attention to the sacrifices the rest of us are making, the longer this goes on for ALL of us.\n\nIf this is you, sorry to break the news to you but the rest of us wholeheartedly think you're a shit person 👍\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#covid19 #covid_19 #covidkindness #covid2020 #covidmask #freethinker #billgates #sheep #government #pandemic #chronicillness #chronicillnesswarrior #covidchronicles #wearthedamnmask","NumberOfLikes":50,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Kirsteen on August 21, 2020.","NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1598047213,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 00:00:13 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Always getting the hookup with my branding from @carissa.embroidery \n\n#naturalhair  #branding #hairextensions #hairproducts #hairtools #hairaccessories #haircare #hairsalon #business #smallbusiness #pandemic #covid #trinidad #trinidadhair #trinidadandtobago","NumberOfLikes":13,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Safiya's Creations (S.

The weavings include threads contributed by participants of the \"Unraveling Together\" Zoom performance project. These threads are woven with the hand-spun wool of laboratory llamas and alpacas who are used to produce antibodies for human drugs including vaccines and antiviral treatments.\n\nThese collaborations will happen one-on-one on Zoom with the artist Laura Splan and will be recorded for a new video artwork to be created during her 9-month artist residency at BioBAT Art Space. The videos will be framed on hands (not faces) as we talk while unraveling textiles. The meetings are short, casual, wandering conversations about pandemic experiences had while unraveling any textile that has meaning to you (a Zoom shirt, a dish towel, anything is welcome).

Posted @withregram \u2022 @latimes When the COVID-19 #pandemic erupted, advocates predicted that a \u201Ctime bomb\u201D was about to go off in the homeless community. Many homeless people live under conditions worse than those of a refugee camp, with #health problems that predispose them to severe illness. Researchers feared they\u2019d succumb in high numbers to the worst ravages of the disease. But the powder keg has yet to go off. There has been little spread of the novel #coronavirus in Los Angeles\u2019 street encampments. Some shelters have had outbreaks, but most of those infected had no symptoms. But homeless people in the rest of California and across the nation have had a better-than-expected time of it as well. And one reason might be the environment where nearly three-quarters of L.A.'s homeless people live: outside.

Hard.  5.5 months of masks, distancing, isolation. \n🖤\nPandemic schooling, round two. Not hanging out with family and friends. No snuggling my nephews. Very valid fears of this virus and my diseases. \n🖤\nLots of emotionally up and down immediate family time.  Plenty of texts, but not in person visits. Skipped our annual St. Louis staycation. No hosting the kids\u2019 birth families for swimming and food. \n🖤\nWriting dozens of articles, but going nowhere to get inspired. No back-to-school coffee dates with girlfriends. \n🖤\nMy baby is about to have her fourth birthday. There won\u2019t be a party. No sharing a snack with her preschool classmates, because now she\u2019s homeschooled. \n🖤\nI dread the holidays.  I normally get super excited about fall, Christmas, etc.  I just imagine it to be more of the same. \n🖤\nWe haven\u2019t been to church in over five months. We worship virtually. \n🖤\nThis country is in shambles. We need new leadership ASAP. \n🖤\nI\u2019m decision fatigued.  There\u2019s only so long a person can keep pressing on without crumbling. We all have our breaking points. \n🖤\nI know I am not alone. Moms, especially, are feeling the weight of the pandemic. We are trying so hard to be strong and confident and organized and productive. But we are struggling. Balancing it all is harder than ever before. \n🖤\nSelf care and superficial prayers  and platitudes aren\u2019t the answer. This pandemic needs to go.  I\u2019m tired of carrying others\u2019 responsibility. \n🖤\nI\u2019m one of those \u201Cvulnerable populations\u201D who is deemed less worthy. Disposable. It\u2019s \u201Cjust a virus\u201D they say. \n🖤\nYes, I\u2019m having a pity party. It\u2019s been 5.5 months. I\u2019m exhausted. Will this ever end?

In the State of California, six people have passed away due to the fires. The hotspots of the fires are the East and South of San Francisco. The fires reportedly started after multiple lightning at times during a severe heat wave. Many building have burned down and nearly \n175 000 people are being forced to evacuate their homes. This is especially difficult when Coronavirus cases keep getting higher. Officials say that some of the fires have doubled in size. We pray for the people of California, and hope that the authorities are able to control the fires before they spread further.

I realized as I watched its lights flash through the sky that right now I need to appreciate the time with my family, because once the world is open again there will be so many flights and so many trips, I know that then I\u2019ll look back on this time as one of peace and memories with family and friends at home. I don\u2019t know where I\u2019ll be next year or what I\u2019ll be doing, and hopefully the world will be in a better place, and this will all be a somewhat fond memory because we were lucky enough to just slow down, take a breath. I know I have so much to be grateful for even to just be able to say that. 2020 isn\u2019t at all what I thought it would be, and for a while I was spinning out of control from the lack of direction, the questions every day with no answers in sight. but now I\u2019m beginning to see this year for what it is, and reminding myself that if I\u2019m able to enjoy the quiet, the peace of staying in one place and forming new routines, then I am lucky enough. 🙏🏻🙏🏻\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#dusk #pandemic #luckyenough #gratitude #grateful #thoughts #inspiration #thoughtcatalog #wheretonext #artfultravels #passionpassport #worldofwanderlust #stillatraveler #worldnomads #traveldeeper #travel #wanderlust #iamatraveler #lovelettertoeurope #traveleurope #mytinyatlas #igersitalia #instaitalia #italy #igersroma #roma #romelovers #viaggiatore #blogger #ilikeitaly","NumberOfLikes":69,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Maggie | The Artful Everyday in Villa Borghese with @igersroma, @italiait, and @igers.roma.

All children born in Finland between October 1st, 1985 and August 31st, 1987, approximately 116,000 were randomized to receive 4 doses of the HiB vaccine (PPR-D, Connaught) starting at 3 months of life or one dose starting after 24 months of life. A control-cohort included all 128,500 children born in Finland in the 24 months prior to the HiB vaccine study. Non-obese diabetic prone (NOD) mice were immunized with a hemophilus vaccine to determine if immunization increased the risk of IDDM.\u2063\n\u2063\nResults: The difference in cumulative incidence between those receiving 4 doses and those receiving 0 doses is 54 cases of IDDM\/100,000 (P = 0.026) at 7 years, (relative risk = 1.26). Most of the extra cases of IDDM appeared in statistically significant clusters that occurred in periods starting approximately 38 months after immunization and lasting approximately 6-8 months. Immunization with pediatric vaccines increased the risk of insulin diabetes in NOD mice.\u2063\n\u2063\nConclusion: Exposure to HiB immunization is associated with an increased risk of IDDM. NOD mice can be used as an animal model of vaccine induced diabetes.","NumberOfLikes":402,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The Aulani Project on August 21, 2020.

Oak Grove Park was selected and approval was given to install the world\u2019s first Disc Golf Course. In 1975, \u201CSteady\u201D Ed installed the first official disc golf course at Oak Grove Park in Pasadena, Los Angeles County, California, with the targets being nothing more than permanent poles placed into the ground. As you can imagine, this brought about many disagreements, so a new way of catching the disc resulted. In 1976 Ed replaced the poles with the first DGA Disc Pole Hole, that were the first disc golf targets to use chains to stop a disc. Which later on became one of many patented disc encatchment devices. Thank you Steady for have the vision and determination to push forward and leave us the great sport of dis golf we know and love today.\n\nPandemic Disc Golf Apparel.

ArcDR3 Initiative was first announced on October 29, 2019 at the 15th APRU Multi Hazards Symposium  in the university Tecnologico de Monterrey in Mexico City. The APRU Multi-hazards Symposium 2019 focused on exploring the interrelationship between disasters and development at the local, national, and global levels as well as understanding how disaster risk reduction (DRR) can best be applied to the future sustainable development of society. The Symposium explored the role of universities in delivering the objectives of the Sendai Framework for 2015-2030 and provided a great platform for the introduction of Architecture for Disaster Risk Reduction and Resilience Initiative to be presented to the experts in disaster risk reduction field. Dr. Osamu Murao, professor at the International Institute of Disaster Science and founder of the International Strategies for Disaster Mitigation Laboratory at Tohoku University and Associate Professor Takako Izumi, Director of the APRU Multi Hazards Summer Program attended the Symposium and presented ArcDR3 Initiative program and plans. #xLAB #IRIDeS #TohokuUniversity #UCLA #APRU #MIRAIKAN #Architecture #UrbanPlanning #urbandesign #Resilience #Communityplanning #ISO #sustainability #disastermitigation #disastermanagement #recovery #reconstruction #globalinitiative #COVID19 #pandemic #research #design #collaboration #education #proactivity #plan #architectureandurbandesignforriskreductionandresilience #arcdr3 #arcdr3initaitve","NumberOfLikes":4,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598038543,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 21:35:43 CEST 2020","Location":"Mexico City, Mexico"},{"CaptionText":"Roses that smell like roses. #roses #gardening #gardenlife🌱 #pandemic #greenthumb","NumberOfLikes":0,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Coco_365 in My Garden.

The lawsuit alleges that changes made by Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, which include eliminating overtime and prohibiting late deliveries, are unlawful, both because he did not follow the legal procedure established by Congress to make changes to the service and because the consequences of the changes violate federal laws by disenfranchising voters and harming people with disabilities, among other alleged violations. The changes have led to delays in mail deliveries, throwing into question whether USPS can handle the expected increase in mail-in ballots this November as voters look for an alternative to in-person voting during the coronavirus pandemic. DeJoy has since said policy changes to the U.S. Postal Service will be suspended until after the general election in November, but Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum (@ellen.rosenblum ) announced Tuesday that Oregon will still join other states in suing the Trump administration.

I was waiting for her in the car when I saw a man knock her phone out of her hand inside the restaurant. That\u2019s when I knew something was wrong. The man who did this to her was a Black male in his early 20s. He was on crutches. I got out of the car and ran to help her.\n\n\u201CWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201D I said. \u201CLook, it\u2019s her Asian boyfriend,\u201D he remarked, to his two friends who were also in the store. They were two white men in their early 20s. One was carrying a skateboard. They began punching  and kicking me, then they hit me with the skateboard and crutches. As I tried to defend myself, the skateboard hit my arm and I ended up with a fractured hand. \n\nI grew up in Markham, Ont. and have always felt that Toronto was a safe place but this has affected me, both physically and mentally.

I envisioned it as the go-to neighborhood place for primary care needs and qualified medical care service, providing help seven days a week. ⠀\n⠀\nDuring the H1N1 outbreak in 2009 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012, PromptMD and its staff supported the Hoboken residents. Since then, our goal to help the community has only grown more prominent. We have remained fully functioning during these tough times, facing the COVID-19 pandemic since its peak. It was not only my decision but also a combined effort of the group to be on the front line of our community's COVID response. We tested several thousands of patients in our offices. The most rewarding and impactful work has been to connect with seniors in the area and perform home visits during the crisis to ensure they remained COVID free. ⠀\n⠀\nIn times like these, PPE supplies go a long way, helping the front line workers to fight back. We are grateful for Hoboken CERT, who donated PPE to us when supplies were constrained. We are thankful for groups like Jersey City Rapid Making Response Group (JCRMRG), as we believe PPE plays a vital role in keeping our communities safe.\"⠀\n⠀\nVisit jcrmrg.org to learn more about PPE supplies and how you can help.","NumberOfLikes":9,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by JC Rapid Maker Response Group on August 21, 2020.

There are so many different ways! You should know all of the options that are available for your child through your child\u2019s school. Here are some tips that have helped us. I hope you find them helpful:)\n\nTip # 1. Be patient with the process. Don\u2019t expect everything to be perfect on the first day. This is distance learning and EVERYONE is learning for the first time how to navigate at the same time.\n\nTip # 2. Keep healthy snacks and refreshments around! This will help to keep your child\u2019s energy levels high enough to want to learn and engage!\n\nTip # 3. Think outside the box! If your child doesn\u2019t like the kitchen table try the couch, or coffee table! A place where there are few distractions is best!\n\nTip # 4. If your child is having a hard time with something make sure you address it with their teacher. My guess is that their teacher will appreciate it, after all you guys are a team. \n\nTip # 5. Give yourself time. Like a lot of time. This is not easy for anyone. Please remember to be kind to yourself. You got this!\n\nTip # 6. Be patient with your child. There are going to be times when they aren\u2019t listening. This is hard on them too. Try to have fun and know this isn\u2019t going to be forever.\n\nIf you have any additional Tips: please comment below!⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️\n\n#specialeducation\n#autumnsroadtodiscovery\n#virtual\n#covid19\n#pandemic\n#yougotthis\n#wegotthis\n#autism\n#autismawareness\n#autismacceptance\n#specialneeds\n#nonverbalautism\n#severe-autism\n#beauty\n#learningathome\n#autismblog\n#autismfamily\n#home\n#tips\n#havefun\n#friday\n#friyay\n#goodvibes\n#goodmorning\n#havefaith\n#haveagreatday\n#swing\n#sensoryplayideas","NumberOfLikes":228,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Autumns_Road_2_Discovery on August 21, 2020 tagging @autumns_road_2_discovery.

As difficult as it might seem, I want every stage of my life to be more exciting than the last.\u201D⠀\n⠀\nIn that time of transition, the former Secretary considered the possibilities: she could write, teach, travel, give speeches, start a business, fight for democracy, help to empower women, campaign for favoured political candidates, spend more time with her grandchildren.⠀\n⠀\nInstead of choosing one or two, she decided to do it all. For nearly twenty years, Albright has been in constant motion, navigating half a dozen professions, clashing with presidents and prime ministers, learning every day. Since leaving the State Department, she has blazed her own trail\u2014and given voice to millions who yearn for respect, regardless of gender, background, or age.⠀\n⠀\nIn this conversation with Hannah MacInnes (@hannahmacin1), we hear this remarkable figure at her bluntest, funniest, most intimate, and most serious. With stories from her life and work, and reflections upon Trump, the pandemic, and the tribulations of the 21st century, this is an unmissable chance to hear from one of the world\u2019s most admired and respected public figures.⠀\n⠀\nListen at howtoacademy.com or wherever you get your podcasts.⠀⠀⠀\n⠀\n#madeleinealbright #politics #government #international #relations #trump #pandemic #unitedstates #secretaryofstate #obama #memoir #democracy #icon #podcast #podstagram #howtoacademy","NumberOfLikes":30,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by How To Academy on August 21, 2020 tagging @hannahmacin1.

This crisis has lasted far longer than many of us could\u2019ve imagined, there\u2019s no end in sight and there\u2019s also no cheat sheet on how to navigate this 🗺️ \n\nTherefore, it\u2019s no surprise we\u2019re experiencing emotional ups and downs, twists and turns. It can feel like every day brings another ride on the \u201Ccoronacoaster\u201D whether or not we wanted a ticket 🎢 \n\nAnd while I\u2019m no expert, there are several things I\u2019ve been doing to try to make my rides a little less bumpy. \n\n 1: Staying as healthy as possible by eating fresh food 🥦 getting daily exercise 🏋🏼\u200D♀\u200D & spending time outside ☀️ \n\n 2: Sticking to a bedtime and wakeup routine ⏰ & getting dressed to work. While it\u2019s tempting to stay up late, wake up late and work all day in pj\u2019s, having the discipline to avoid these things has helped me feel more in control. \n\n 3: Maintaining social interactions with others. This has looked like visiting family 👨\u200D👩\u200D👦\u200D👦 going on masked & socially distant walks 🚶🏽\u200D♀\u200D calling & video chatting with friends 📱 taking socially distanced @encinitas4equality yoga classes in the park 🧘🏾\u200D♀\u200D going on masked social justice @runforbreonna runs to meet like-minded neighbors like @jillbaylon 🏃🏼\u200D♀\u200D & using @bumblebff to make new girlfriends 👩🏾 \n\n 4: Being mindful of my exposure to the news. It\u2019s easy to be overwhelmed in the middle of a pandemic, a presidential election year and a social justice reawakening, so I\u2019ve picked a reliable news source and stick to that. 📰 \n\n 5: Remembering to be kind to myself & practicing self-care whenever I can: journaling ✍🏼 meditating 🧘🏾\u200D♀\u200D allowing enough time for sleep 🛏️ even getting a \u201Cmedical massage\u201D 💆🏽\u200D♀\u200D \n\n So, next time you realize you\u2019ve boarded the coronacoaster once again, check back here for some ideas on how to shorten your ride. 💖\n\n #meetkristinenglish #digitalmarketing #entrepreneur #businessowner #smallbusiness #webdesign #socialmediamanagement #encinitas #corona","NumberOfLikes":25,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Kristin English in Encinitas, California.

This is me when I started my very first company. I was working from bedroom and any random place I was in the mood to go. Had nothing fancy to start with so began with whatever I had - a basic laptop and a BIG dream. \n\n2. This is the UN conference room. This is where I dreamt to speak. That time, it seemed like an impossible dream. I visualised myself standing on the stage and sharing my journey.\n\n3. In 2015, my wildest dream came true. Here I am, speaking in a UN conference room. I was the youngest youth representative of entrepreneurship (India).\n\n4. I went for a conference in Boston where I decided to run a 10 km marathon with Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian of all time. \n\nThat's when it hit me, it's all about creating a legacy now. After this day, I started speaking across the globe - shared my story, gave away the lessons I learnt and thus started leaving my legacy behind.\n\n5. Damn, this is a day I can never forget. My first paid international speech in Singapore & stay at my dream hotel - Marina Bay Sands (fully sponsored for me, my brother and a friend 😍) \n\nPLUS: Got my first international social media consultancy project.\n\n6. Got featured in a magazine for the very first time. Since then have been featured in several publications like IB Times, YourStory, Business World and more.\n\n7. In 2019, initiated my first office project. I worked out of home and my dad\u2019s old office from 2013 to 2018. A dream came true - 2 storied building with a personal glass cabin. I hardly stay in the office - 3-4 days out of the month 😛\n\n8. This is when the #pandemic hit us. Dreams were shattered. Zero hustle, no team support, factories closed. How do I keep my business alive?\n\nWe lit the #entrepreneur spirit and my whole family - brother, sister, mom, dad and me - we started packaging and parceling the products ourselves.\n\n9. 2020- started my #podcast , Figuring Out With Raj Shamani, a one-stop learning point for people who want to grow. I will be sharing all that I have learnt so far, and all that I will be figuring out about \u2018GROWTH\u2019 in my day to day life.","NumberOfLikes":11980,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":265,"Timestamp":1598026436,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 18:13:56 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"😷😷 #staysafe","NumberOfLikes":1,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Client_Focused in Margate Beach.","NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598026428,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 18:13:48 CEST 2020","Location":"Margate Beach"},{"CaptionText":"Walking the dogs 🐕 #dog #walking #cute #sport #pandemic #kawaii #dogvscat","NumberOfLikes":2,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Zara Alex Ivanova on August 21, 2020.

Ready for some time apart. Ready for something different.\n\nBut not without questioning my choice\u2014and myself.\n\nI've wondered what kind of mother I am to send my kid off to a brand new school during a pandemic.\n\nI've worried that maybe the whole thing will just be too much for my girl, though based on who I know her to be, it's not.\n\nI've considered all kinds of worst-case-scenarios, subsequently blaming myself for each hypothetical one.\n\nBut overall, I've been comfortable with my decision during a time in which none of the choices seem good enough. \n\nNonetheless, the weeks\u2014maybe months\u2014of anxiety and wondering and worry poured from the corners of my eyes as I stepped back and watched my girl brave this new world.\n\nI let her go and my emotions considered that their cue to do the same.\n\nAnd I realized the tears weren't as much about her as they were me.\n\nBecause as I watched her befriend the kid who was standing alone; as I watched her chat excitedly with her new teacher; as I watched her march confidently to the front of the line with her mask in position, it was clear she was going to be okay.\n\nShe's ready for this.\n\nAnd while I thought I was too, it turns out it's just going to take me another minute to get there.\n\nBecause no matter the circumstances\u2014no matter how much physically or mentally prepared I feel\u2014my heart is never prepared for her to grow another year older. Especially during a year when we're basically all preparing for the worst.\n\nBut I can't carry the weight of every worst-case-scenario any longer. My shoulders have been bearing it for too long. \n\nAnd today, the tears felt cleansing as the weight began to drift away. Because even though I don't know what this school year holds, I know that I love my kid and I truly trust God that she's going to be okay.

Negative Brexit-related headlines triggered the initial leg of the intraday slide, which accelerated further in the wake of a strong pickup in the US dollar demand.\n\nThe British pound met with some fresh supply after the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said that the seventh round of Brexit talks failed to yield any breakthrough. Barnier's UK counterpart, David Frost also mentioned about the deadlock, suggesting weeks of uncertainty ahead. This, in turn, took its toll on the sterling.\n\nIt will now be interesting to see if the pair continues to attract some dip-buying at lower levels or weakens further to retest weekly lows support near the 1.3065 region. Some follow-through selling will confirm a near-term breakdown and turn the pair vulnerable to accelerate the slide further towards challenging the key 1.3000 psychological mark. \n\n#GBPUSD #Forex #Trading #Brexit #Economy #Recovery #Pandemic #Crisis #Covid19 #Pound #Dollar #Chart #Technical #Analysis #Fundamental #News","NumberOfLikes":11,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by THE FINANCIAL WAY on August 21, 2020.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598024656,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 17:44:16 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Evenings are life's way of saying that you are really closer to your dreams\n\n#tb #office #workfromhome #pandemic #covid_19 #stayhome #staypositive #staysafeeveryone #namaste","NumberOfLikes":19,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Goutam Shiva in Hetauda.

Put on that sexy outfit in place of loungewear today.\n\nSet up a candlelight dinner, offer a back rub, picnic in your yard - whatever could create a shift and show your partner you are still interested and desirous of them.

Estava com a diabetes descontrolada, acima do peso e sem praticar exercícios físicos há algum tempo.\n\nEssa constatação é fato e o que isso nos ensina? Vamos deixar de lado um pouco a covid e lembrar que não é novidade que a prática de exercício físico e ponderação na alimentação trazem benefícios à saúde. E isso não tem nenhuma relação com estética, estamos falando de saúde.\n\nEmbora esse discurso seja antigo, percebemos que muitas pessoas ainda deixam essas orientações de lado em virtude de uma rotina de trabalho e vão postergando mudanças nos hábitos de vida.

Almost everyone wore masks and kept distances. There was this one fellow who passed everyone, maskless, looking for change. You could feel the tension as he approached people. He by action and circumstance would be considered a high risk individual. While the initial reaction was fear as he approached, as he left I imagined his situation and how the pandemic has affected the most vulnerable in our society and the increased fear and stress they are facing. I can only imagine how much worse it is for those without the resources to cope.  Remember always be kind, show compassion, give love.
