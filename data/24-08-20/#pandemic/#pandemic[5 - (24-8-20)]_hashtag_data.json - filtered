Anak perempuan membutuhkan teman akrab atau kelompoknya, meskipun dalam usia-usia 6 hingga 12 tahun mereka sering berganti-ganti kawan sesuai kecenderungan dan rasa nyaman.\n.\nAnak perempuan adalah \"rahasia besar\". Mereka memiliki privasi dan rahasia tersendiri. Banyak hal yang mereka sembunyikan dari dunia luar, perlu berbelit-belit untuk mencari tahu tentang kesukaan mereka, idola mereka, dan banyak hal tentangnya. Jalan paling cepat mengetahui tentang diri perempuan adalah menggali informasi dari teman dekat atau kelopoknya.\n.\nKata-kata yang muncul ketika telah terpojok untuk membocorkan informasi dirinya adalah: \"tapi jagan bilang siapa-siapa ya?\".\n.\nPada diri anak perempuan yang harus diperhatikan adalah persoalan rasa dan pengertian. Hal itu kadang-kadang hanya sepele, tapi menurut mereka justru itulah yang perlu dipenuhi; sekedar merautkan pensil yang patah, baginya adalah satu perhatian yang megah.\n.\n.\n============================\n.\n#berandaguru #pendidikananak #pendidikan #sekolah #bdr #pandemic #covid_19 #belajardirumah #sekolahonline #anakperempuan","NumberOfLikes":29,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Kaharudin in SD Al-Islam Yogyakarta.

The lawsuit alleges that changes made by Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, which include eliminating overtime and prohibiting late deliveries, are unlawful, both because he did not follow the legal procedure established by Congress to make changes to the service and because the consequences of the changes violate federal laws by disenfranchising voters and harming people with disabilities, among other alleged violations. The changes have led to delays in mail deliveries, throwing into question whether USPS can handle the expected increase in mail-in ballots this November as voters look for an alternative to in-person voting during the coronavirus pandemic. DeJoy has since said policy changes to the U.S. Postal Service will be suspended until after the general election in November, but Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum (@ellen.rosenblum ) announced Tuesday that Oregon will still join other states in suing the Trump administration.

Our host prepared a crispy baby shrimp like cake. The shrimp were actually alive when cooking. They were baby shrimp, which means it didn\u2019t require peeling or deveining. Next a batter was made similar to a funnel cake or pancake batter. The chef mixed the two together and fried it up. Flipping only once. This treat reminded me of potato latke. It was so crispy and delicious when dipped in a gently cooked runny egg yolk. You are now in heaven.

However, there appears to be growing support for the scheme across Europe as a result of people losing jobs because of the #coronavirus #pandemic.\n\n\u201CSo far, the debate about the basic income has been like a philosophical salon at best and a war of faith at worst.

You're exactly my target demographic. I have seen SO MANY Covid-19 deniers on the internet and argued with a few of them in the last few days. And there seems to be more of them all the time. \n\nThey always parrot out the same shit. That we are sheep. That they are free thinkers (so obviously superior). That Bill Gates is microchipping us with vaccinations. That masks are pointless. 5G is bad.  They use the word scam a lot which seems ridiculous to me. I don't see anybody winning out of this. Worldwide recession eh ü•á we're WINNING\n\nBut yes, please don't let people get away with this crap. They are risking our lives. It just takes one twat to wander into a pub with symptoms for it to spread to potentially tens of families.\n\nIf you have an exemption from wearing a mask, sure. I'm not going to argue or judge you. I have asthma and I really struggle with a mask at times too. But I persist because I CARE about other human beings (again, not judging you if you have a genuine medical reason). I don't like this new normal but if the worst part of my day is that I have to briefly wear a bit of cloth on my face then WOOP DE DOO. I've obviously got it really hard. üôÑ I also have to take immunosuppressants so I'm at extra risk of complications if I were to catch anything. \n\nEven if this IS some giant made up hoax - which it definitely isn't- I'd rather stand on the other side of this knowing I did my part to help public health for the good of my community. These people? They only care about themselves. And that makes them pretty shit people in my books. \n\nThe longer you don't wear the damn mask and flaunt your god given 'rights' to not pay attention to the sacrifices the rest of us are making, the longer this goes on for ALL of us.\n\nIf this is you, sorry to break the news to you but the rest of us wholeheartedly think you're a shit person üëç\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#covid19 #covid_19 #covidkindness #covid2020 #covidmask #freethinker #billgates #sheep #government #pandemic #chronicillness #chronicillnesswarrior #covidchronicles #wearthedamnmask","NumberOfLikes":50,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Kirsteen on August 21, 2020.","NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1598047213,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 00:00:13 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Always getting the hookup with my branding from @carissa.embroidery \n\n#naturalhair  #branding #hairextensions #hairproducts #hairtools #hairaccessories #haircare #hairsalon #business #smallbusiness #pandemic #covid #trinidad #trinidadhair #trinidadandtobago","NumberOfLikes":13,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Safiya's Creations (S.

Many homeless people live under conditions worse than those of a refugee camp, with #health problems that predispose them to severe illness. Researchers feared they\u2019d succumb in high numbers to the worst ravages of the disease. But the powder keg has yet to go off. There has been little spread of the novel #coronavirus in Los Angeles\u2019 street encampments. Some shelters have had outbreaks, but most of those infected had no symptoms. But homeless people in the rest of California and across the nation have had a¬†better-than-expected time of¬†it as well.

In the State of California, six people have passed away due to the fires. The hotspots of the fires are the East and South of San Francisco. The fires reportedly started after multiple lightning at times during a severe heat wave. Many building have burned down and nearly \n175 000 people are being forced to evacuate their homes. This is especially difficult when Coronavirus cases keep getting higher. Officials say that some of the fires have doubled in size. We pray for the people of California, and hope that the authorities are able to control the fires before they spread further. May God grant peace to the people who have lost their lives, and their homes in these horrible fires.\n\nCredits: @bbcnews \n\n#onestopnews #newsforyouth #news #update #youth #teen #usa #america #us #california #sanfrancisco #cali #wildfires #fire #evacuate #pandemic #corona #covid #rip #restinpeace","NumberOfLikes":16,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598043616,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 23:00:16 CEST 2020","Location":"California, USA"},{"CaptionText":"üíØAVAILABLE NOW ..üî•üî• üåèüåèüì¨üìÆüì≠WORLDWIDE DELVERIES AND SELFPICKUP Available... _______\n üì®üì• EMS FEDX DHL POSTAL SERVICEüì¶üì¶&MORE \n_________ üìûCALL OR WHATSAPP FOR ORDER PLACEMENT & ENQUIRIES ‚òé +2348065310488\n\n________\n\nSIZES AVAILABLE.....\n_\n\n_________\n\n#polishgirl #fashiondesigner #fashion #fashionblogger #fashionblogger#instablog #collection #dubai #uba #ghanafashion #gucci #ny #football #versace#fendi #fashiondesigner #pandemic #america #canadagirls #usagirls #nigeria#egungunbecareful #fashionista #ghanagirls #fashionphotography #fashionworldwide#lockdown","NumberOfLikes":3,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by WILFREDCOLLECTION R.C 2549869üÜó on August 21, 2020.

I realized as I watched its lights flash through the sky that right now I need to appreciate the time with my family, because once the world is open again there will be so many flights and so many trips, I know that then I\u2019ll look back on this time as one of peace and memories with family and friends at home. I don\u2019t know where I\u2019ll be next year or what I\u2019ll be doing, and hopefully the world will be in a better place, and this will all be a somewhat fond memory because we were lucky enough to just slow down, take a breath. I know I have so much to be grateful for even to just be able to say that. 2020 isn\u2019t at all what I thought it would be, and for a while I was spinning out of control from the lack of direction, the questions every day with no answers in sight. but now I\u2019m beginning to see this year for what it is, and reminding myself that if I\u2019m able to enjoy the quiet, the peace of staying in one place and forming new routines, then I am lucky enough. üôèüèªüôèüèª\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#dusk #pandemic #luckyenough #gratitude #grateful #thoughts #inspiration #thoughtcatalog #wheretonext #artfultravels #passionpassport #worldofwanderlust #stillatraveler #worldnomads #traveldeeper #travel #wanderlust #iamatraveler #lovelettertoeurope #traveleurope #mytinyatlas #igersitalia #instaitalia #italy #igersroma #roma #romelovers #viaggiatore #blogger #ilikeitaly","NumberOfLikes":69,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Maggie | The Artful Everyday in Villa Borghese with @igersroma, @italiait, and @igers.roma.

All children born in Finland between October 1st, 1985 and August 31st, 1987, approximately 116,000 were randomized to receive 4 doses of the HiB vaccine (PPR-D, Connaught) starting at 3 months of life or one dose starting after 24 months of life. A control-cohort included all 128,500 children born in Finland in the 24 months prior to the HiB vaccine study. Non-obese diabetic prone (NOD) mice were immunized with a hemophilus vaccine to determine if immunization increased the risk of IDDM.\u2063\n\u2063\nResults: The difference in cumulative incidence between those receiving 4 doses and those receiving 0 doses is 54 cases of IDDM\/100,000 (P = 0.026) at 7 years, (relative risk = 1.26). Most of the extra cases of IDDM appeared in statistically significant clusters that occurred in periods starting approximately 38 months after immunization and lasting approximately 6-8 months. Immunization with pediatric vaccines increased the risk of insulin diabetes in NOD mice.\u2063\n\u2063\nConclusion: Exposure to HiB immunization is associated with an increased risk of IDDM. NOD mice can be used as an animal model of vaccine induced diabetes.","NumberOfLikes":402,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The Aulani Project on August 21, 2020.

Oak Grove Park was selected and approval was given to install the world\u2019s first Disc Golf Course. In 1975, \u201CSteady\u201D Ed installed the first official disc golf course at¬†Oak Grove Park¬†in Pasadena, Los Angeles County, California, with the targets being nothing more than permanent poles placed into the ground. As you can imagine, this brought about many disagreements, so a new way of catching the disc resulted. In 1976 Ed replaced the poles with the first DGA Disc Pole Hole, that were the first disc golf targets to use chains to stop a disc. Which later on became one of many patented disc encatchment devices.

ArcDR3 Initiative was first announced on October 29, 2019 at the 15th APRU Multi Hazards Symposium  in the university Tecnologico de Monterrey in Mexico City. The APRU Multi-hazards Symposium 2019 focused on exploring the interrelationship between disasters and development at the local, national, and global levels as well as understanding how disaster risk reduction (DRR) can best be applied to the future sustainable development of society. The Symposium explored the role of universities in delivering the objectives of the Sendai Framework for 2015-2030 and provided a great platform for the introduction of Architecture for Disaster Risk Reduction and Resilience Initiative to be presented to the experts in disaster risk reduction field. Dr. Osamu Murao, professor at the International Institute of Disaster Science and founder of the International Strategies for Disaster Mitigation Laboratory at Tohoku University and Associate Professor Takako Izumi, Director of the APRU Multi Hazards Summer Program attended the Symposium and presented ArcDR3 Initiative program and plans. #xLAB #IRIDeS #TohokuUniversity #UCLA #APRU #MIRAIKAN #Architecture #UrbanPlanning #urbandesign #Resilience #Communityplanning #ISO #sustainability #disastermitigation #disastermanagement #recovery #reconstruction #globalinitiative #COVID19 #pandemic #research #design #collaboration #education #proactivity #plan #architectureandurbandesignforriskreductionandresilience #arcdr3 #arcdr3initaitve","NumberOfLikes":4,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598038543,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 21:35:43 CEST 2020","Location":"Mexico City, Mexico"},{"CaptionText":"Roses that smell like roses. #roses #gardening #gardenlifeüå± #pandemic #greenthumb","NumberOfLikes":0,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Coco_365 in My Garden.

The lawsuit alleges that changes made by Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, which include eliminating overtime and prohibiting late deliveries, are unlawful, both because he did not follow the legal procedure established by Congress to make changes to the service and because the consequences of the changes violate federal laws by disenfranchising voters and harming people with disabilities, among other alleged violations. The changes have led to delays in mail deliveries, throwing into question whether USPS can handle the expected increase in mail-in ballots this November as voters look for an alternative to in-person voting during the coronavirus pandemic. DeJoy has since said policy changes to the U.S. Postal Service will be suspended until after the general election in November, but Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum (@ellen.rosenblum ) announced Tuesday that Oregon will still join other states in suing the Trump administration.

Also, you won\u2019t get your room before 3pm (our room was ready around 6pm) so I suggest you flag that in advance. Mind you, we booked a club room (where ideally we\u2019re supposed to check-in upon arrival via a guest relations desk) but rather ended up queuing 1-2hours to check-in from the usual front desk.\nThere\u2019s one main pool in the hotel so the earlier you book a sun bed the better. \nYou can also go to \u201CLa Plage\u201D (the beach part of the hotel) but is pretty much limited since it\u2019s a lagoon. This beach contains some water activities too!\nAs for the food, I had this burger next to La Plage. I recommend it but minus the cheese as it doesn\u2019t come melted on the patty. The service was slow and price is around 17JD per person.\nBreakfast was okay, the hotel practices social distancing where a member of the hotel staff helps you with the food.

It was not only my decision but also a combined effort of the group to be on the front line of our community's COVID response. We tested several thousands of patients in our offices. The most rewarding and impactful work has been to connect with seniors in the area and perform home visits during the crisis to ensure they remained COVID free. ‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nIn times like these, PPE supplies go a long way, helping the front line workers to fight back.

There are so many different ways! You should know all of the options that are available for your child through your child\u2019s school. Here are some tips that have helped us. I hope you find them helpful:)\n\nTip # 1. Be patient with the process. Don\u2019t expect everything to be perfect on the first day. This is distance learning and EVERYONE is learning for the first time how to navigate at the same time.\n\nTip # 2. Keep healthy snacks and refreshments around! This will help to keep your child\u2019s energy levels high enough to want to learn and engage!\n\nTip # 3. Think outside the box! If your child doesn\u2019t like the kitchen table try the couch, or coffee table! A place where there are few distractions is best!\n\nTip # 4. If your child is having a hard time with something make sure you address it with their teacher. My guess is that their teacher will appreciate it, after all you guys are a team. \n\nTip # 5. Give yourself time. Like a lot of time. This is not easy for anyone. Please remember to be kind to yourself. You got this!\n\nTip # 6. Be patient with your child. There are going to be times when they aren\u2019t listening. This is hard on them too. Try to have fun and know this isn\u2019t going to be forever.\n\nIf you have any additional Tips: please comment below!‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è\n\n#specialeducation\n#autumnsroadtodiscovery\n#virtual\n#covid19\n#pandemic\n#yougotthis\n#wegotthis\n#autism\n#autismawareness\n#autismacceptance\n#specialneeds\n#nonverbalautism\n#severe-autism\n#beauty\n#learningathome\n#autismblog\n#autismfamily\n#home\n#tips\n#havefun\n#friday\n#friyay\n#goodvibes\n#goodmorning\n#havefaith\n#haveagreatday\n#swing\n#sensoryplayideas","NumberOfLikes":228,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Autumns_Road_2_Discovery on August 21, 2020 tagging @autumns_road_2_discovery.

Here's why that and many other things you might be hearing about the coronavirus aren't true.\n\n#covid19 #coronavirus #myth #health #pandemic","NumberOfLikes":1999,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":29,"Timestamp":1598029406,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 19:03:26 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"‚ñ™Ô∏è‚ñ™Ô∏è‚ñ™Ô∏è\n.\nCuci muka trus ngopi bro. @nadiemmakarim ...üòÇüòÇ\n.\nJangan kebanyak onbit makanya ü§£ü§£ü§£\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nüëáFollow Us :\n‚ûñ üî∞¬†@blackroomz\n‚ûñ üî∞¬†peju4ng_medsos212\n.@mad.jimmi_gentar_alam\n@mad.jimmi\n@kavri2\n#thewarriorsquad¬†#peju4ng_medsos212¬†\n#boegexs_depp__¬†#thewarriorsquad #therevolusioners#ganyangpki¬†\n#sayabanggajadimusuhpki¬†\n#indonesiasiappeoplepower¬†\n#bersatulahindonesia¬†#rezimotoriter¬†\n#selamatkannkri¬†#mahasiswabergerak¬†\n#tauhid¬†#pandemic#makzulkanjokowibubarkanpdip¬†#breakingnews¬†#fuadbakh¬†#viral¬†\n#beritaterkini¬†#opposite6890¬†\n#tolakomnibuslaw¬†#covid_19\n#tolakruuhip¬†#reformasidikorupsi¬†\n#indonesiabertauhid¬†#indonesia¬†\n#saveindonesia¬†#alumni212¬†\n#muslim¬†#indonesiasiappeoplepower\n#mendikbudri","NumberOfLikes":1,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598029401,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 19:03:21 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"NOW AVAILABLE, FIGHT THE SPREAD OF COVID-19 IN BLUUCORTI \u203CÔ∏è \u2063\n.\u2063\n.\u2063\n.\u2063\n.\u2063\n.\u2063\n#facemask #covid19 #covid #pandemic #pandemic2020 #mask #masks #customfacemask #facemaskselfie #facemask #facemasksforsale #facemaskhomemade #facemaskstyle #„Åã„Çè„ÅÑ„ÅÑ #kawaiifashion #animegirls #kawaiiart #kawaiidesu #bluucorti #bluucortidamovement‚úÖ‚úÖ #hypebeast #hypelife","NumberOfLikes":60,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":8,"Timestamp":1598029392,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 19:03:12 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Happy Friday!

As difficult as it might seem, I want every stage of my life to be more exciting than the last.\u201D‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nIn that time of transition, the former Secretary considered the possibilities: she could write, teach, travel, give speeches, start a business, fight for democracy, help to empower women, campaign for favoured political candidates, spend more time with her grandchildren.‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nInstead of choosing one or two, she decided to do it all. For nearly twenty years, Albright has been in constant motion, navigating half a dozen professions, clashing with presidents and prime ministers, learning every day. Since leaving the State Department, she has blazed her own trail\u2014and given voice to millions who yearn for respect, regardless of gender, background, or age.‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nIn this conversation with Hannah MacInnes (@hannahmacin1), we hear this remarkable figure at her bluntest, funniest, most intimate, and most serious. With stories from her life and work, and reflections upon Trump, the pandemic, and the tribulations of the 21st century, this is an unmissable chance to hear from one of the world\u2019s most admired and respected public figures.‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nListen at howtoacademy.com or wherever you get your podcasts.‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\n#madeleinealbright #politics #government #international #relations #trump #pandemic #unitedstates #secretaryofstate #obama #memoir #democracy #icon #podcast #podstagram #howtoacademy","NumberOfLikes":30,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by How To Academy on August 21, 2020 tagging @hannahmacin1.

Menstruation is one of the topics but we need to consider also pregnant ladies, babies, singles ladies with kids and elder people. \n\n@menstruationis.asacredright needs more donations to continue to buy menstrual pads. And hopefully inspire more people to take action to help others. Due the uncertain visa situation, our aim is to continue until we can, and hopefully evolve in the future soon.\n\nIn Koh Phangan we have around 600 people who came from Myanmar looking for job and better conditions in these touristic island. Since the lockdown many burmese and locals lost their job and source of income.  Less and less people on the island, and more people are in need.\n\nOnly in Haad Rin area we have around 150 menstruating ladies, 25 babies and 6 pregnant. 11 babies under Naan Formula (very expensive product), and a new born baby with mother not healthy due lack of food.  Next month we have a new baby arriving, and if the mother needs any kind of assistance, there's no free health service available for non thai people. \n\nThis is the situation only one area of Koh Phangan. Not all the burmeses people were counted and we should also include in those numbers all the thai people which are also suffering with this pandemic situation.

This crisis has lasted far longer than many of us could\u2019ve imagined, there\u2019s no end in sight and there\u2019s also no cheat sheet on how to navigate this üó∫Ô∏è \n\nTherefore, it\u2019s no surprise we\u2019re experiencing emotional ups and downs, twists and turns. It can feel like every day brings another ride on the \u201Ccoronacoaster\u201D whether or not we wanted a ticket üé¢ \n\nAnd while I\u2019m no expert, there are several things I\u2019ve been doing to try to make my rides a little less bumpy. \n\n 1: Staying as healthy as possible by eating fresh food ü•¶ getting daily exercise üèãüèº\u200D‚ôÄ\u200D & spending time outside ‚òÄÔ∏è \n\n 2: Sticking to a bedtime and wakeup routine ‚è∞ & getting dressed to work. While it\u2019s tempting to stay up late, wake up late and work all day in pj\u2019s, having the discipline to avoid these things has helped me feel more in control. \n\n 3: Maintaining social interactions with others. This has looked like visiting family üë®\u200Düë©\u200Düë¶\u200Düë¶ going on masked & socially distant walks üö∂üèΩ\u200D‚ôÄ\u200D calling & video chatting with friends üì± taking socially distanced @encinitas4equality yoga classes in the park üßòüèæ\u200D‚ôÄ\u200D going on masked social justice @runforbreonna runs to meet like-minded neighbors like @jillbaylon üèÉüèº\u200D‚ôÄ\u200D & using @bumblebff to make new girlfriends üë©üèæ \n\n 4: Being mindful of my exposure to the news. It\u2019s easy to be overwhelmed in the middle of a pandemic, a presidential election year and a social justice reawakening, so I\u2019ve picked a reliable news source and stick to that. üì∞ \n\n 5: Remembering to be kind to myself & practicing self-care whenever I can: journaling ‚úçüèº meditating üßòüèæ\u200D‚ôÄ\u200D allowing enough time for sleep üõèÔ∏è even getting a \u201Cmedical massage\u201D üíÜüèΩ\u200D‚ôÄ\u200D \n\n So, next time you realize you\u2019ve boarded the coronacoaster once again, check back here for some ideas on how to shorten your ride. üíñ\n\n #meetkristinenglish #digitalmarketing #entrepreneur #businessowner #smallbusiness #webdesign #socialmediamanagement #encinitas #corona","NumberOfLikes":25,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Kristin English in Encinitas, California.

This is me when I started my very first company. I was working from bedroom and any random place I was in the mood to go. Had nothing fancy to start with so began with whatever I had - a basic laptop and a BIG dream. \n\n2. This is the UN conference room. This is where I dreamt to speak. That time, it seemed like an impossible dream. I visualised myself standing on the stage and sharing my journey.\n\n3. In 2015, my wildest dream came true. Here I am, speaking in a UN conference room. I was the youngest youth representative of entrepreneurship (India).\n\n4. I went for a conference in Boston where I decided to run a 10 km marathon with Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian of all time. \n\nThat's when it hit me, it's all about creating a legacy now. After this day, I started speaking across the globe - shared my story, gave away the lessons I learnt and thus started leaving my legacy behind.\n\n5. Damn, this is a day I can never forget. My first paid international speech in Singapore & stay at my dream hotel - Marina Bay Sands (fully sponsored for me, my brother and a friend üòç) \n\nPLUS: Got my first international social media consultancy project.\n\n6. Got featured in a magazine for the very first time. Since then have been featured in several publications like IB Times, YourStory, Business World and more.\n\n7. In 2019, initiated my first office project. I worked out of home and my dad\u2019s old office from 2013 to 2018. A dream came true - 2 storied building with a personal glass cabin. I hardly stay in the office - 3-4 days out of the month üòõ\n\n8. This is when the #pandemic hit us. Dreams were shattered. Zero hustle, no team support, factories closed. How do I keep my business alive?\n\nWe lit the #entrepreneur spirit and my whole family - brother, sister, mom, dad and me - we started packaging and parceling the products ourselves.\n\n9. 2020- started my #podcast , Figuring Out With Raj Shamani, a one-stop learning point for people who want to grow. I will be sharing all that I have learnt so far, and all that I will be figuring out about \u2018GROWTH\u2019 in my day to day life.","NumberOfLikes":11980,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":265,"Timestamp":1598026436,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 18:13:56 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"üò∑üò∑ #staysafe","NumberOfLikes":1,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Client_Focused in Margate Beach.","NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598026428,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 18:13:48 CEST 2020","Location":"Margate Beach"},{"CaptionText":"Walking the dogs üêï #dog #walking #cute #sport #pandemic #kawaii #dogvscat","NumberOfLikes":2,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Zara Alex Ivanova on August 21, 2020.

Ready for some time apart. Ready for something different.\n\nBut not without questioning my choice\u2014and myself.\n\nI've wondered what kind of mother I am to send my kid off to a brand new school during a pandemic.\n\nI've worried that maybe the whole thing will just be too much for my girl, though based on who I know her to be, it's not.\n\nI've considered all kinds of worst-case-scenarios, subsequently blaming myself for each hypothetical one.\n\nBut overall, I've been comfortable with my decision during a time in which none of the choices seem good enough. \n\nNonetheless, the weeks\u2014maybe months\u2014of anxiety and wondering and worry poured from the corners of my eyes as I stepped back and watched my girl brave this new world.\n\nI let her go and my emotions considered that their cue to do the same.\n\nAnd I realized the tears weren't as much about her as they were me.\n\nBecause as I watched her befriend the kid who was standing alone; as I watched her chat excitedly with her new teacher; as I watched her march confidently to the front of the line with her mask in position, it was clear she was going to be okay.\n\nShe's ready for this.\n\nAnd while I thought I was too, it turns out it's just going to take me another minute to get there.\n\nBecause no matter the circumstances\u2014no matter how much physically or mentally prepared I feel\u2014my heart is never prepared for her to grow another year older. Especially during a year when we're basically all preparing for the worst.\n\nBut I can't carry the weight of every worst-case-scenario any longer. My shoulders have been bearing it for too long. \n\nAnd today, the tears felt cleansing as the weight began to drift away. Because even though I don't know what this school year holds, I know that I love my kid and I truly trust God that she's going to be okay. Even though I wanted to stand there with her on that playground forever.\nCONT IN COMMENTS","NumberOfLikes":44,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Jenny Albers on August 21, 2020.

Negative Brexit-related headlines triggered the initial leg of the intraday slide, which accelerated further in the wake of a strong pickup in the US dollar demand.\n\nThe British pound met with some fresh supply after the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said that the seventh round of Brexit talks failed to yield any breakthrough. Barnier's UK counterpart, David Frost also mentioned about the deadlock, suggesting weeks of uncertainty ahead. This, in turn, took its toll on the sterling.\n\nIt will now be interesting to see if the pair continues to attract some dip-buying at lower levels or weakens further to retest weekly lows support near the 1.3065 region. Some follow-through selling will confirm a near-term breakdown and turn the pair vulnerable to accelerate the slide further towards challenging the key 1.3000 psychological mark. \n\n#GBPUSD #Forex #Trading #Brexit #Economy #Recovery #Pandemic #Crisis #Covid19 #Pound #Dollar #Chart #Technical #Analysis #Fundamental #News","NumberOfLikes":11,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by THE FINANCIAL WAY on August 21, 2020.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598024656,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 17:44:16 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Evenings are life's way of saying that you are really closer to your dreams\n\n#tb #office #workfromhome #pandemic #covid_19 #stayhome #staypositive #staysafeeveryone #namaste","NumberOfLikes":19,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Goutam Shiva in Hetauda.

I mean, we all are, but his story is especially interesting. The pandemic paused one of his newest concepts, @thightimesbirdhouse, and the space of his former restaurant, @funkygrits, is 50 ft away from the murder of George Floyd. As a native of Minneapolis and a black man living in America, his heart was torn to shreds. His proximity to the tragedy thrust him into the spotlight: CNN, The New York Times, and others all wanted to talk to the guy.\n.\nBut it\u2019s August and, frankly, he\u2019s chillin\u2019. This year has been one of incredible hardship but his non-stop work ethic chugs along. He\u2019s all about action \u2013 Jared has no desire to dwell on racial injustice all day or stress about any sort of socioeconomic collapse. This is why many of his efforts these days are altruistic, giving back. He is love personified.\n.\nTo see how he was doing, I visited him at his idyllic farm in Cologne, MN. The stillness that one experiences upon arriving on the property \u2013 aside from the 4 dogs and innumerable cats \u2013 is undeniable. It\u2019s no wonder he\u2019s able to work so hard: going home every day is a mini vacation.\n.\nMy interview with him is available on Spotify and Apple Podcasts. Link is in the bio. Remember, if you dig the show, subscribe, share with a friend, or leave a 5-star review on Apple Podcasts.
