It\u2019s been an integral part of our business strategy since the #pandemic began. As such we\u2019ve pulled together our Top 10 Tips for Hosting Webinars to share with you. \n\n1.\tTime \u2013 getting the timing right can make or break attendance at a webinar. Are you clashing with other events? What time zone are you and potential attendees in? Lunchtime can be great for people if they like a working lunch.\n2.\tDay \u2013 we all know that Mondays and Fridays can be busy catching up on the last week or preparing for the next, so look to hold webinars mid-week. From experience we found Thursday is a good day.\n3.\tLength \u2013 this will very much depend on the subject and the interaction you want with attendees. Overly long webinars could mean that attendees skip out and miss important points. Where possible limit to an hour, especially if being held over lunchtimes. \n4.\tRecordings \u2013Making a recording available will be appreciated by participants who skipped out or could not attend last minute. It also enables attendees to share with their connections.\n5.\tTopic \u2013 be focused rather than general and provide real world examples.\n6.\tEngagement \u2013 Ask questions to engage audience and use polls and chat for responses.\n7.\tPresentation \u2013 Use images to convey a message rather than text and ensure continuity throughout, especially if co-presenting with others where a joint presentation has been created.\n8.\tMarketing - promote early, encourage people to share, provide an easy mechanism for sign-up.\n9.\tTechnology \u2013 with many of us working from home currently do you have sufficient Wi-Fi to avoid dips in connection? Are you familiar with the software, a trial run before hand will add confidence in delivery.\n10.\tHave a buddy \u2013 someone who can monitor the chat and polls and provide immediate feedback to support the presenter. \n\nWould you add to the Tips?

The implications are much beyond just health crisis, and it has long-lasting psychosocial and economic implications. Although the psychological offshoots such as depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, and sleep disturbances are being studied in-depth, there is a dearth of literature on the sexual well-being and sexual practices during this pandemic. Considering the physical distancing; travel restrictions; the high human\u2013human transmission rate; misinformation and uncertainty about the sexual routes of transmission for SARS-CoV-2; and fear about intimacy, sexuality, and safe sexual practices have increased significantly. This is more prominent in newly settled or distanced couples and the frontline health workers, with increased risk exposure to the virus. For them, guilt and distress associated with sexual relationships might increase primary psychiatric and sexual disorders. This, in turn, impacts relationships and emotional bonding in couples and affects healthy coping during the pandemic crisis. Although sexual abstinence is the safest practice to prevent transmission, it is not practically feasible in all cases. Risk reduction counseling, sex with quarantined partners, and digital sex are other options that are worth exploring. There are additional concerns of digital safety, unhealthy use of technology, cyber-crimes, and online extortion. Keeping this in the background, this advocacy article glances through the effects of past outbreaks on sexuality, reviews the current recommendations, and proposes methods and approaches for sexual well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic, which is vital for overall public health.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#Coronavirus #COVID-19 #intimacy #pandemic #sex #sexuality #ScienceCitationIndexExpanded #WebofScience #Psychiatry #IndiaJournalofPsychiatry #indexing #latestresearch #medicalsociety #Wolterskluwer #medknow #psychiatry #psychiatrist #psychologist #psychology #indianpsychology","NumberOfLikes":1,"Hashtags":["#Coronavirus","#COVID-19","#intimacy","#pandemic","#sex","#sexuality","#ScienceCitationIndexExpanded","#WebofScience","#Psychiatry","#IndiaJournalofPsychiatry","#indexing","#latestresearch","#medicalsociety","#Wolterskluwer","#medknow","#psychiatry","#psychiatrist","#psychologist","#psychology","#indianpsychology"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Indian J Psychiatry on August 21, 2020.

Every afternoon my classmates met at The Arc de Triomf in the heart of Barceloña. Next we took the metro to Santa Coloma. When we got off we would enjoy a pastry or quick bite at a new bakery or cafe we discovered before making it to campus. When we arrived, we were impressed by the gorgeous campus. They even had an on campus greenhouse where they grew various vegetables and offered classes in the garden. There was also an on campus vineyard for olives and grape cultivation. We were welcome with banners of the connection between the @theculinaryinstituteofamerica and University of Barcelona at @holatmc. We as Americans were invited with warm hospitality and began cooking in their kitchen for an enrichment of knowledge and food. Campus was definitely a sacred place.

This was such a cool experience and am forever grateful for it. I got to play a room where I'd seen some of my favorite artists play. It was surreal. \n\nI hope one day things like this can happen again. We can work to it slowly, as long as we wear our masks, social distance and keep events at very limited capacity. (40 max. It's been done and it works. @dwayneeldredge has been doing so at @horsebrookcafe_  and is keeping it safe and booking lots of great bands). I know we will get past this. We will be able to have large events again if we all take proper precautions. I try not to worry about it too much but it's days like these where it's harder when these memories pop up. \n\nI love my mates in the bands I have and I'm so lucky to be able to create with them still during this time and during this pandemic.

With a vision to spread my wings, I went to Australia at the start of this year, the new pandemic corona hit a huge wave not on human health but on human mindset as well. All the dreams I had been carefully drafting for over 4 years were swept in an unexpected sweep. I fortunately or unfortunately stayed in a place in Australia where the members of the host family were personally important to my life. Most things were out of my control \u2013 my behaviour, my interests, my mannerism, and most importantly my mindset and soul. Out of control here I don\u2019t define it to be hazardous, but more self destructive way \u2013 in the process of pleasing others, I completely lost myself. This process kept happening for over 5 months and at the end of the phase is when I discovered, I completely lost track of my heart and am a whole new different person now. The start of the second half of 2020 is when I discovered this. And now yet again I feel I now have to discover the old me. Being someone who was always full of life and happiness yet a very sensitive person and who cannot handle slightest stress and emotions \u2013 it was indeed a difficult journey of life. Few souls tried understanding me in bits and pieces but the struggle was real - for I was the one standing in the battlefield everyday and the other supporters were at the speculators bench \u2013 safe and sound.\nIrrespective of what others think do not live for others. No matter what! No matter when! No matter how! Because if you ever do so, the results are a self destructive weapon you are aiming at yourself. Always live by your own rules, independence, and calm; and cherish every decision you take along. I lost myself severely in the process of impressing others for I wish you wouldn't make the same mistake.\n\nMahasakthi Selvakumar\nOn #indianwomenstoryproject\n\n#womendairyeveryday #womenstories #pandemic #feminists #feminism #utsavlife #selfcare #selflove #pandemiclockdown #lockdown","NumberOfLikes":46,"Hashtags":["#indianwomenstoryproject","#womendairyeveryday","#womenstories","#pandemic","#feminists","#feminism","#utsavlife","#selfcare","#selflove","#pandemiclockdown","#lockdown"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598014711,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 14:58:31 CEST 2020","Location":"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia"},{"CaptionText":"Внимание!!!

Ready, set, wealth. 🤑 Many of us are still reeling from the effects of the #pandemic, but let\u2019s get into our conversation about #money and #generationalwealth. This is one of the best times to work on your financials #goals... while you have time to think about the future.\nToday\u2019s tip is to *create financial goals* for you, your family, and the next generation. Since most of us are stuck inside, there are plenty of opportunities to discuss this. What do you want to accomplish financially? What do you want for your family, your children, and the generations to come? \nOnce you decide on at least 3-5 goals, go back to the very first tip (make a list of all expenses). Does what you spend most of your money on match your financial goals? If not, start making adjustments. \nFor example, if you want better health for you and your family... it doesn\u2019t make sense to spend a chunk of your income on cigarettes, junk food, or fast food. Make sure your financial habits (spending) match your financial goals (strategies).\nIf you want your kids and grandchildren to attend college, it doesn\u2019t make sense to spend a large chunk of your income on expensive gaming systems or expensive clothes. You should, instead, start a college savings account. \nSo, actually, it\u2019s not necessarily that the wealthy spend like they\u2019re poor. They spend money strategically. They spend money on the things that matter most to their long-term financial goals. They also spend money in ways that protect their wealth. Those types of strategies are forward-thinking. \nPoor people tend to spend money with no long-term goals in mind. In many cases, the main goal is instant gratification. Those types of strategies are short-sighted. Take the time to plan your family\u2019s future, and to make the necessary adjustments to your spending. \nIt\u2019ll be worth it. We\u2019re building ... 💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵 See you next Friday!

History does like to repeat itself\n💚💚💚💚💚💚\n\nFailures are usually the most conceited of men. If we believe deep down that we are worthless, we may feel we have to cover up our failures. Sometimes we do this by becoming boastful and grandiose in our attitude toward ourselves and others. We protect ourselves by putting on airs. Other people may be taken in for a while. But sooner or later, our real feelings about ourselves will begin to show through, like an old painting that has been imperfectly covered over. Eventually we may begin to refuse positions of responsibility to flunk out of relationships. We can get to the point where we dare not take risks, for we know we will fail. Our sexual addiction makes us lose touch with our real selves. When we begin to find and create ourselves anew, we will become more humble and more modest in our dealings with others. Now that we are getting well, we don\u2019t need to keep others at a distance through conceited behavior.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nInner drugs. Because we were raised in chaotic or controlling homes, our internal compass is oriented toward excitement, toxic shame, self-hate,self-doubt and stress. Do the situations sound familiar? We walk into a room full of strangers and instinctively find the most toxic people in the room to befriend. We leave home with \u201Ejust enough\u201D time so our adrenaline is pumping when we arrive at our destination. We over-commit ourselves so that we can\u2019t possibly do everything we promised, and than shame ourselves because we\u2019ve failed yet again. Many of us just naturally choose situations that create drama, people who are spinning out of control, and a life that balances on the edge of insanity. It almost feels like we\u2019re hard-wired to operate that way. \n#healing  #god  #spirit  #joy  #recovery  #unity  #service  #freely  #morning  #forgiveness #honoring #affirming  #worth  #forgive  #nationalgeographic  #arabic  #lebanon  #fullyalive  #serenity  #12steps  #addiction  #recovery  #slaa  #grouptherapy  #aa  #blue #cave #pigeon #pandemic","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#healing","#god","#spirit","#joy","#recovery","#unity","#service","#freely","#morning","#forgiveness","#honoring","#affirming","#worth","#forgive","#nationalgeographic","#arabic","#lebanon","#fullyalive","#serenity","#12steps","#addiction","#recovery","#slaa","#grouptherapy","#aa","#blue","#cave","#pigeon","#pandemic"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Bartosz Luczak on August 21, 2020.

Kenapa harus buibu, bahkan digambarkan yakni ibu2 rumah tangga ? karena realitasnya demikian walopun banyak juga laki2 bergunjing. Perempuan dg ideologi masyarakat patriarkal umumnya dikonstruksikan diri mereka untuk hanya terbatas  pada hal2 domestik, yg mengakibatkan terbatasnya ruang gerak berinteraksi, berkembang dan berwawasan. Hal ini juga berkaitan dengan terbatasnya orang-orang yang mereka temui.  Pengetahuan yang dikonsumsi tentu akan berbeda dg mereka yang setiap hari harus melakukan perencanaan, mmbuat strategi, merancang sebuah sistematika, di samping ia melakukan pekerjaan domestik bekerja sama dengan pasangannya. \n.\nini bukan soal perempuan bekerja atau tidak bekerja saja. tetapi kecenderungan setiap orang dapat menentukan dirinya untuk menjadi produktif atau tidak produktif. \n.\n\u201CJika dirimu tidak disibukkan dengan hal-hal yang baik, pasti akan disibukkan dengan hal-hal yang batil\u201D\nDan sangat mungkin saat luang seseorang melakukan hal yang batil.

The IMF always wants privatization because then these globalist powers can come in and buy out these former public assets. Our advice is for countries not to take out IMF loans and if they do not to pay the loans back. Loans should only be taken out if there is a referendum and the whole countries agrees and votes to the loan. These loans come with a list of conditions, in 2018 Argentina took out a loan, the conditions were a 35% cut to health spending, 30% cut to education spending and 20% cut to security spending. They were also asked to raise the prices for electric and gas by 20%, a reduction to pensions up to 50%. In addition, to reduce investments and projects like the stoppage to the Las Lenas tunnel this would link Argentina to Chile. \nIn Egypt they got them to sell off 50% of the shares the Suez Canal, to renew school buildings which were mainly American schools and Universities, the restorations to American bases, and to transfer ownership of Tiran Sanafir islands to American companies doing business in Saudi Arabia. \n\nFollow OTRV On Instagram at: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/otrvideo\/\nFollow OTRV On Twitter At: https:\/\/twitter.com\/OTRVideos\nFollow OTRV On Facebook At: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/offtherecord.otrv.3\n\n#egypt #imf #pandemic #debt #american #deepstate #globalism #rothschilds #suezcanal  #tiranisland #saudiarabia #morganstanley #rockefellercenter #cia #rockefeller #rothschild #goldstandard #atomicbomb #theeconomist #ksa #loans #argentina #referendum #lasleñas #chile","NumberOfLikes":3,"Hashtags":["#egypt","#imf","#pandemic","#debt","#american","#deepstate","#globalism","#rothschilds","#suezcanal","#tiranisland","#saudiarabia","#morganstanley","#rockefellercenter","#cia","#rockefeller","#rothschild","#goldstandard","#atomicbomb","#theeconomist","#ksa","#loans","#argentina","#referendum","#lasleñas","#chile"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by OTRV on August 21, 2020.

I was so grateful to be getting the urgent care but so tired.\nI met with a consultant who had a brief consultation with me and then examined both breasts. \"I'm going to send you for an ultrasound, if they're worried they will do a biopsy\". He then proceeded to draw dots on my right breast.\nI walked down to the ultrasound area and waited, so many thoughts running through my mind. It felt like the longest wait. In reality it was probably only 30 mins but it felt like hours.\nI went in to have my ultrasound done. \"We're going to need to do a biopsy and I want the results back today so I'm going to go get  a couple of people.\" Oh great.\nWithin 5 minutes there was a team of ladies all ready to take my biopsy. I had a shot of anaesthetic in my right breast and then she took three biopsies. In between each biopsy a nurse pressed down on my chest to stop the bleeding and reduce the bruising. \"Can you breathe?\" I haven't been able to breathe since the 1st April 🥴\nAfter the biopsies were taken I was sent back to the consultant to discuss next steps. He was going to discuss my biopsy report with the other consultants.\nThe biopsy was confirmed as a fibroadenoma (benign tumour) that didn't need operating on. What a relief.","NumberOfLikes":24,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Talya Varga on August 21, 2020.

The dream, moreso a nightmare, paralyses you with fear but is actually a missive for change. The shadows in our lives remind us of the things we must leave behind and the things we must pursue.\n\nSometimes even in the face of immense calamity, there is hardly any change. Just awe, fear, palpitation and a gradual return to the status quo. This could lead to procrastination and postponement of future good.\n\nThe pandemic is really a shadow of our time on earth.

Country music runs deep in my veins, having been brought up on it via my parents and grandparents, however I briefly shied away from my love of country during my early teens and boarding school life ( Country was deemed daggy and you were terribly \u201CUn-Cool\u201D if you liked it ). Rediscovering my love for Dolly again at 16, Songs like \u201CCoat Of Many Colours\u201D, \u201CHere You Come Again\u201D and \u201CShattered Image\u201D remain some of my favourites, her incredible song writing skills and Smokey Mountain, Songbird sweetness, providing me with a lifelong soundtrack. Her music has gotten me through some sad times ( \u201CWildflowers \u201C ), and some happy times ( \u201CBaby I\u2019m Burning ), somehow her voice always makes me feel good, especially during this whole Covid-19, stage 4 lockdown, pandemic mess! Helping me cope with feelings of homesickness and a yearning for the life of that young innocent, carefree child from the bush, Dollys voice is particularly soothing at the moment. So naturally my obsessions this week have turned to the original \u201CDumb Blonde\u201D, and some of my favourite images of her over the decades.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#dollyparton#icon#legend#idol#queenofcountry#countrymusic#tibooburra#brokenhill#outback#australia#bushkid#joelene #coatofmanycolors #shatteredimage#hereyoucomeagain#tieourloveinadoubleknot #9to5 #the_bearded_blogger_2obsessions #covid19 #pandemic#lockdown#babyimburnin","NumberOfLikes":6,"Hashtags":["#dollyparto","#ico","#legen","#ido","#queenofcountr","#countrymusi","#tibooburr","#brokenhil","#outbac","#australi","#bushki","#joelene","#coatofmanycolors","#shatteredimag","#hereyoucomeagai","#tieourloveinadoubleknot","#9to5","#the_bearded_blogger_2obsessions","#covid19","#pandemi","#lockdow","#babyimburnin"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597994561,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 09:22:41 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Theatres & #Covid_19.The real impact.

In a pandemic, to survive tough businesses you need razor-sharp thinking. A must-read book for CEOs, entrepreneurs and start-up founders on how to deal with uncertainty. Author Ozan Varol @ozanvarol who served the 2003 Mars Exploration Rovers project, talks about how, \"We're hesitant to think big, reluctant to dance with uncertainty and afraid of failure. These are the bugs.\"\nHere are 7 Secrets of How to Think Like a Rocket Scientist:\nRule 1: Make Doubt your Superpower. Every genius hesitates. We should be fueled not by a desire for a quick catharsis but by intrigue. Where certainty ends, progress begins. Einstein tangoed with uncertainty, conducted imaginative thought experiments and asked questions nobody dared.\nRule 2: Embrace the sense of possibilities, push your limits, explore what is possible.\nRule 3: Question your assumptions. Why you do the things you do. Don't do things that everyone does.\nRule 4: Don't be stuck in systems. They solve problems that don't even exist today.\nRule 5: Create Moonshot goals. Our goals are often safe and cushioned because we fear failure. We have been seduced to thinking flying lower is safer than flying higher.\nRule 6: You must be willing to share your unique ideas with the world, don't be repressed by conformity.\nRule 7: Don't Rulebound Yourself. Ozan writes, \"Research shows we become increasingly rulebound as we grow older. Events begin to rhyme. Days begin to repeat. We repeat the same overworn soundbites, stick to the same job, talk to the same people, watch the same shows. It's choose-your-own-adventure book that always has same ending. Our processes are developed in response to yesterday's troubles, if you don't question it  will impede forward movement.\"\n.\nThink Like A Rocket Scientist is published by Penguin Random House\n#books #book #pandemic #2020 #bookstagram #bookstagrammer #booklover #bookaddict #booknerd #bookreview #booksofinstagram #bookworm #bookgram #booklovers #selfhelp #rules #life #work #think #mind #instamood #insta #newnormal #pandemic2020 #instagood","NumberOfLikes":9,"Hashtags":["#1","#books","#book","#pandemic","#2020","#bookstagram","#bookstagrammer","#booklover","#bookaddict","#booknerd","#bookreview","#booksofinstagram","#bookworm","#bookgram","#booklovers","#selfhelp","#rules","#life","#work","#think","#mind","#instamood","#insta","#newnormal","#pandemic2020","#instagood"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Nona Walia on August 20, 2020 tagging @penguinrandomhouse.

I\u2019ve always enjoyed writing my thoughts because it\u2019s therapeutic, so I figured why not be brave and just blog! (This pandemic has given me a lot to process!!)\n\nHonestly, it\u2019s been a roller coaster of emotions. 2020 is a year we will never forget but won\u2019t want to remember.\nI know everyone has a different opinion about the pandemic (among other things) however, the reality is that people are dying.🖤\nIn fact, recently my daughter\u2019s grandmother passed away from COVID, (her funeral was Monday), yesterday we confirmed my mom has tested positive (she is sick but seems to be progressing 🙏🏼🥺).\nI pray and have faith she will recover.\nWith that said... it\u2019s frustrating to that people refuse to do their part in order to potentially save a life.\nPeople are protesting about wearing a mask, closed gyms, and salons. Life is not what we want it to be, we miss going out, hanging out with friends, vacations, shopping, playgrounds, etc. (I can relate, I\u2019m sure we all can!)\n\nBut, have you asked yourself:\nWould I feel the same if I lost a parent? a sibling?, a child? Or a friend? How would my life change?!\nUnfortunately as humans we are stubborn, at the slightest inconvenience we kick and scream. Some won\u2019t learn until tragedy hits home. Some tragedies we can overcome... but death is not one off them. Be considerate of others even if you don\u2019t believe or care about your own life. Anyway, I know we are all over talking about corona virus but it weighs real heavy in my heart because people I know have died.💔🤍🖤😔 my condolences to anyone who has lost a loved one or is dealing with hardships and grief. \n#1stblogpost #bittersweet #bittersweetblog #pandemic #covid19 #blog #mood #staysafe #dontbeselfish #thankful","NumberOfLikes":6,"Hashtags":["#1stblogpost","#bittersweet","#bittersweetblog","#pandemic","#covid19","#blog","#mood","#staysafe","#dontbeselfish","#thankful"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Andrea Victoria (Drea) on August 20, 2020.

Salah satu sumber protein hewani ini ternyata bisa membantu menurunkan tekanan darah pada pasien hipertensi. Hasil ini diperoleh dokter spesialis gizi klinis, Diana F Suganda, M.Kes, dari Journal of the American College of Nutrition pada 2009. Jurnal tersebut menjelaskan bahwa asupan dairy foods (susu dan turunannya) yang disertai dengan diet rendah garam bermanfaat bagi kelompok hipertensi menurunkan tekanan darahnya.\n\"Penelitian mereka itu paling gampang,\" kata Diana.\n\"Kalau kita kasih makanan mengandung magnesium, makanan mengandung kalium, satu-satu begitu kan repot. Makanya, di penelitian itu mereka memakai penggatinya adalah susu,\" katanya pada diskusi Kupas Tuntas Kebaikan Susu untuk Tunjang Kesehatan Tubuh pada Selasa, 15 Mei 2019.\nDiana, mengatakan, hipertensi dipengaruhi oleh berbagai mineral; natrium, kalium, dan magnesium. Kalau kadar di dalam tubuh cukup dan tidak berlebihan, tidak terjadi proses faktor risiko dari penyakit kardiovaskular tersebut.\nSusu, kata Diana, mencakup semua mineral tersebut. Sehingga angka kejadian kekambuhan hipertensi pada pasien jadi terjaga,\"\n\"Kebayang enggak, sih, jangka panjang tekanan darah tinggi terus? Bisa kena ke mata, ke ginjal, sedangkan hipertensi tidak bergejala,\" kata Diana.\n\"Kamu cuma tahu kalau tekanan darahnya tinggi kalau tensi (mengukur tekanan darah). Cuma kamu tidak pernah merasakan gejala apa-apa,\" Diana menekankan.\nBeda dengan sakit maag, yang rasa sakitnya bisa kita rasakan dan akan langsung hilang setelah minum obat maag. Sementara hipertensi, tidak bergejala sama sekali, tahu-tahu ginjal rusak, mata mengalami penurunan. Pas dicek, ternyata itu dampak dari hipertensi jangka panjang. \n\nNah kan ajaibkan susu.....

Two years ago, they quit their high paying jobs in the UAE to start less-PAper and PLAstic initiative (PAPLA) @papla.in, a venture to develop products out of areca leaf sheaths. The lockdown and the uncertainty which came with it, did have its disadvantages - but they attempted to stay positive realizing the greater good and soon explored ways to utilise this period in the best possible ways.\n\nIn the first phase of the lockdown which lasted 21 days, they challenged themselves to upcycle-recycle-repurpose all possible items with tools handy at home. They had left over cloths, glass bottles, fallen areca sheaths, old window panel, tyre, tyre tubes, coconut shells, electric wire and more. They also put in place a kitchen garden, started microgreen farming and even tried vegan food. By the end of the first phase, they had 21 home-made green products. They say, these activities kept them engaged and helped them keep their mental stress and worries about \"what next\" at a bay. \n\nIn the second phase, they are on an extraordinary mission to make a \"Hundred Seed Ball\" which they would bomb to some place that needs re-forestation activity while they are off to their next trip. They together feel that, this is the very moment everyone must realise the importance of co-existence and the importance of life. Saranya and Devakumar unanimously believes that going green is the only escape for humans from not ending up like DINOSAURS!! \n\n#journal_hope #hope #compassion #love #humanity #stayhome #staysafe #change #survival #pandemic #lockdown #covid19 #stories #inspire #kasargod #kerala #nature #naturephotography #naturelovers #garden #upcycle #recycle #repurpose #reforestation #seedballs  #microgreens #paper #plastic #coexistence","NumberOfLikes":51,"Hashtags":["#journal_hope","#hope","#compassion","#love","#humanity","#stayhome","#staysafe","#change","#survival","#pandemic","#lockdown","#covid19","#stories","#inspire","#kasargod","#kerala","#nature","#naturephotography","#naturelovers","#garden","#upcycle","#recycle","#repurpose","#reforestation","#seedballs","#microgreens","#paper","#plastic","#coexistence"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1597983514,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 06:18:34 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"WE ARE THE NEWS.

There is limited government funding that is being distributed to health facilities in these countries creating major barriers for the healthcare sector. Many nurses recognise the extra help these vulnerable communities need and are keen to travel as soon as it's possible to lend a hand. We have continued to receive new applications for our Nurses In Action programs over the last few months and over 85% of existing applications have simply postponed their travel plans rather than cancelling altogether.

These three \u201Cepidemics\u201D share common underlying drivers and interact with each other to generate devastating consequences. \n.\nIt has become increasingly clear to endorse key double-duty or triple-duty actions to target multiple key issues at once. Such actions may include implementing policy actions to enable extensive and systemic change to our food supply, petrochemical, urban design and transport structures.\n.\nIt is evident that our youth demand action on environmental contamination, climate change and racial equity. These issues they care about also impact upon their health and wellbeing. \n.\nSimply educating our youth on nutrition has unfortunately not been as effective as public health researchers had hoped in tackling the obesity epidemic. Future interventions for young people should incorporate the concerns of young people to develop policies that ultimately impact the environment, social equality and their health. \n.\nRef:\nhttps:\/\/www.fhi.no\/en\/studies\/co-create\/news2\/which-obesity-interventions-work\/\n.\n#evidencebites #hungry4science #global #science #environment #climatechange #undernutrition #malnutrition #nutrition #scienceiscool #publichealth #health #pandemic #COVID19 #syndemic #obesity #intervention #youth","NumberOfLikes":20,"Hashtags":["#EvidenceBites.","#evidencebites","#hungry4science","#global","#science","#environment","#climatechange","#undernutrition","#malnutrition","#nutrition","#scienceiscool","#publichealth","#health","#pandemic","#COVID19","#syndemic","#obesity","#intervention","#youth"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597982645,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 06:04:05 CEST 2020","Location":"Sydney, Australia"},{"CaptionText":"With its headquarters in Atlanta and its legacy carriers...⠀\n...A custom 3-layered mask just for a Delta Airlines employee. ⠀\n📌We can customize a 3 layered mask anyway you want. ⠀\n📌Just pick your colors and we\u2019re on it!👍⠀\n⠀\n***SWIPE***TO***VIEW***⠀\n⠀\n#masks #facemask #surgicalmasks #faceshields #customized #frontlineworkers #essentialworkers #hospital #grocery #supportsmallbusiness #supportlocalbusiness #blackownedbusiness #blackowned #dentist #peachtree #peachtreecenter #atlanta #georgia #atlantageorgia🍑 #georgiapeach  #hawks #vote #falcons #august #pandemic #safety #ppe","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#masks","#facemask","#surgicalmasks","#faceshields","#customized","#frontlineworkers","#essentialworkers","#hospital","#grocery","#supportsmallbusiness","#supportlocalbusiness","#blackownedbusiness","#blackowned","#dentist","#peachtree","#peachtreecenter","#atlanta","#georgia","#atlantageorgia🍑","#georgiapeach","#hawks","#vote","#falcons","#august","#pandemic","#safety","#ppe"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597982644,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 06:04:04 CEST 2020","Location":"Atlanta, Georgia"},{"CaptionText":"Do watch the video presented by Dhruv Rathee\n#ugcvsfinalyearstudents\n#jeeexam #neet #ugc #nta #india #life #career #covid19 #pandemic2020 #pandemic #studentslifematters #2020 #studenstlife","NumberOfLikes":29,"Hashtags":["#ugcvsfinalyearstudents","#jeeexam","#neet","#ugc","#nta","#india","#life","#career","#covid19","#pandemic2020","#pandemic","#studentslifematters","#2020","#studenstlife"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597982632,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 06:03:52 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"It\u2019s no coincidence that those who focus on others in need and support their communities, especially during times of crises, tend to be happier and healthier than those who act selfishly.

(Yes, Mama, I had on my N95 mask.) I was working as fast as I could so I could get back in the house. I noticed that I had ash on my arms and could feel it getting in my eyes. My glasses lenses were scattered with it. I noticed it on everything. I noticed that I couldn\u2019t see behind our property very far today from all the smoke. When I got in the house, I decided to take a shower to get the smoke and ash off of me, and I noticed that the top of my head had quite a bit of ash on it. Seeing that ash on my head, even more than when I was out in the yard, shoved me right into a reality I hadn\u2019t examined thoroughly before.\n\nAll I could think about was that people\u2019s lives were raining down and floating all around me\u2026 pasts, futures, hopes, dreams, plans, tiny pieces of homes and precious belongings, maybe even pets and other wildlife. And I couldn\u2019t help but think, \u201CPlease, no people.\u201D Whatever it used to be, it\u2019s all things that can\u2019t be put back together again. They can be replaced, some of it, but if you\u2019ve ever lost or broke something special, often times it\u2019s just not the same. I hear it said often in times like this, \u201CAt least they didn\u2019t lose their lives.\u201D In an obvious sense that is 100% true, but it\u2019s also not true at all \u2013 when we work so hard for the things we have, the places we live, the things we cultivate and that are precious to us.\nCertainly I think it\u2019s a safe bet that the vast majority of us would not trade our lives for any of those other things, but it doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t hurt or isn\u2019t significant. It may even be life-changing and cause a domino effect of other hardships.
