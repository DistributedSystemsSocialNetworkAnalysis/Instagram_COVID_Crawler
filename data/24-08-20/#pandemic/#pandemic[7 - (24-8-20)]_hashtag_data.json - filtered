It can help prevent 1 in 5 respiratory infections and 1 in 3 diarrhea-related illnesses. Therefore, it is important to engage in proper hand hygiene practices, especially during the pandemic and with school starting soon. Not only does hand hygiene protect you, it also protects the people around you by preventing the spread of germs. This is particularly important if you live with or come into contact with vulnerable populations, such as the very young, the elderly, those with pre-existing medical conditions, and those with compromised immune systems.\n⠀\nIn this post, we describe the different steps of handwashing, some tips to help encourage your family to practice hand hygiene, and the key moments of hand hygiene.

Maybe it will. Maybe it\u2019s okay to not know.\n\nIt feels defeating to swallow this pill after the enormous effort I have put into working on myself and my mental health over the past couple of years. But I have to realistically accept that currently all of my usual supports and healthy coping mechanisms have been removed due to ongoing lockdowns. My daily life is not only challenging, it is excruciatingly exhausting with few rewards to balance any of it. Therapy can only guide you so far out of a slump when difficult circumstances are out of your control. \n\nThis past year and half has felt like a continuous series of losses that keep knocking me down, and I naively get back up believing I\u2019ll be fine. Adding the pressures of a global pandemic, restrictions, homeschooling, parenting three children with complex needs, grief, loneliness, breakups, rejections, questioning identity\/social standing, perceived failures, and more trauma than I can safely handle, has pushed me to my lowest point and made me doubt my mind and abilities beyond what is functional for a parent. And now I am just too tired to do it on my own. \n\nOf course it\u2019s okay for me to accept that I have done everything I could possibly do with the resources available to me and right now, I should and will accept a little helping hand back up. This is not a way out, but an assisted way through, and learning to accept help without shame has been a huge focus for me after all. \n\nSo here I go, taking charge of my own life and decisions that I can control.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#grief#griefandloss#youngwidow#trauma#ptsd#adhd#medicated#loss#pandemic#mentalhealth#mentalhealthstigma#support#help#movingforward#getthroughit#itsokaynottobeokay#selfcare","NumberOfLikes":45,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Jaz Gartner on August 20, 2020.","NumberOfComments":24,"Timestamp":1597969486,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 02:24:46 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"When the world is so loud and pulling you in many directions stay centered, focused and don\u2019t stop smiling. \n.\n.\n.\n#pandemic#newnormal#music#creative#hawaiicreativity#hawaiilife#musiclife#routine#dok2#familybusiness#familyfirst#filipinas🇵🇭#filipinohawaiian","NumberOfLikes":672,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by MELEANA BROWN\/SINGER on August 20, 2020.

In May, Deputy Inspector Stewart Loo proposed the creation of an anti-Asian hate crime task force, hoping that through a dedicated team they could build a better rapport with the community.\n\nThe team includes 25 Asian American officers that speak a second language, Loo said. Not having to use translators will increase investigators' ability to develop relationships with victims and ultimately lead to more cooperation, he continued. Harrison noted that 4 of the 17 arrests were done with the help of the task force.\n\n\"This task force has been built and will continue to build trust and understanding between the #NYPD and with Asian New Yorkers,\" said Harrison.\n\nThe task force will be permanent, Harrison said, and other culture-based task forces may be considered in the future.\n\nWhen asked about why there wasn't a dedicated task force for #anti-Semitic crimes, Harrison said that this task force was put together because of Asian Americans' lack of reporting and cooperation with the police. Victims of anti-Semitic crimes work with the police in most cases, he said.\n\n\"Since January, before COVID-19 became a national crisis, Asian Americans in New York City have been targeted in unprovoked racist attacks. They have been berated while riding the #subway and #harassed walking down the street,\" said Thomas Yu, co-executive director of #AsianAmericansforEquality, in a statement CNN. \"We applaud the city's decision to create an Asian Hate Crimes Task Force, a move that is long overdue... \n(CNN)\n\n#newstheheadliner","NumberOfLikes":1,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by NEWS The Headliner on August 20, 2020.

The Museum is a staple in our hometown of Saginaw, Michigan and we were super honored to share how we've been coping and creating during the pandemic.\n.\nOne of our creative outlets this season has been writing and recording for our new single that we'll be releasing this fall! We hope you\u2019ll take a listen to the podcast and be inspired to keep creating in whatever capacity God has called you to do! Link in bio.⠀\n⠀\nHere are some key takeaways:⠀\n⠀\n✔️ We\u2019re all called to create because we are made in the Creator\u2019s image. We each have something to give to bring beauty to the world and others. We were created to give, not just consume.⠀\n⠀\n✔️Creating energizes and replenishes our souls. One of the reasons we may feel disconnected and frustrated is because we aren't creating enough.⠀\n⠀\n✔️ We must defeat resistance, a force that wants to distract us and prevent us from doing our work. Resistance is fueled by fear. (Steven Pressfield - The War of Art)⠀\n⠀\n✔️ We can\u2019t wait to feel inspired to create. It\u2019s our job to show up and do the work. Inspiration will follow perspiration.⠀\n⠀\n✔️ Don't forget to take care of yourself! Self-care is important.⠀\n⠀\n\u201CEach of you has been blessed with one of God's many wonderful gifts to be used in the service of others.

There were set backs, tears, pain, and unexpected trials experienced all along the way. There were times I felt like we were clawing our way up from the depths of hell, hanging on by a fingernail.\n\nI hope I never have to see my child in the ICU on a breathing machine again and yet the covid19 pandemic makes that a very real, looming possibility. Sending my kids to school (or not) has never been as emotionally charged for me as it was this year. \n\nBut through all the heartache I still feel gratitude. I still have my daughter. She has persevered and is a fighter. We are surrounded by astounding, knowledgeable doctors, nurses and other Healthcare workers that we love. I have seen the kindness and goodness of others through countless acts of service. My family has grown closer and formed bonds that are tighter than I ever imagined possible. I have felt God's love for my family in both small and simple ways as well as mighty miracles. We are blessed. \n\nSo with faith and hope I look forward to more infusion days and many, many more diagnose-aversaries with my beautiful daughter.\n#havefaith #gratitude #diagnosisanniversary #kindness #granulomatosiswithpolyangiitis #autoimmunedisease #2020 #pandemic #vasculitiswarrior #vasculitis #infusion #infusionday","NumberOfLikes":56,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by MichelleConder on August 20, 2020 tagging @onetoughlittlecookie.

People often ask me questions about COVID-19, they assume that because I work in the medical field and on the front lines, I must have answers. One of the most frustrating parts of the progression of this pandemic is the longer it draws on the more in the dark I actually feel. What is clear is that the effects of this virus are vastly different from patient to patient. For some it is deadly and for others they show no symptoms at all. As humans, I think we have this tendency to cling to any information we hear simply out of fear of the unknown. We want answers and right now we have few. This is an ever evolving situation, the only constant is change. ✨We will adapt. ✨We will evolve. ✨This work is nothing short of challenging, but it continues to teach me to move with gratitude, patience, compassion and perseverance.

Currently, the vaccine is being developed by a pharmaceutical company, AstraZeneca, and Oxford University. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has stated that a deal has been made with the company, granting \"early access [to the vaccine] for every Australian\" if the clinical trial proves to be fruitful. The country has recorded 450 deaths due to the outbreak, most of which are concentrated in Victoria. And earlier this month, it declared a state of disaster, imposing strict lockdown measures after a surge in infection rates. Hopeful that the vaccines will be available by early next year, Prime Minister Morrison expects the vaccine to be made mandatory to not relive the destructive events imposed by this pandemic.

Most due to me. 🙃\n\nThe pandemic & quarantine made me WAKE THE F UP! 🙋🏻\u200D♀️\n\nI realized I needed to take the leap, leave my house & move into his.\n\nWas I nervous?!

Showing up at Tonys bawling my eyes out..he being so confused because I never told him what I was doing. Never having lived with a boy.. let alone someone I was dating... no clue what to expect. 🤪\n\nHowever both of us knew if I didn\u2019t pull that trigger then we would have ultimately not made it. Not because we didn\u2019t care for one another but because we didn\u2019t know how long this pandemic would last.\n\nHere we are 6 months into this pandemic & I am so THANKFUL I had the COURAGE to pull that trigger. To TRUST my gut. \n\nThe move hasn\u2019t been all sunshine & rainbows; just like anything new - adjusting to living with someone can be challenging - especially during a pandemic when more than half your clothes & items are still in another house...

Yes, the logistics of the district are daunting: 9 high schools, 15 junior highs, 63 elementary schools. About 67,000 students in total, 7,500 full and part time employees.

While you are at it, add speech impairment to the list.\n\nNecessity they say is the mother of all inventions. A lot of the inventions that have been created for people with disability stems from mothers with special needs children. I have met mothers who have shown me the things they created to help their children perform one activity or the other.\n\nThere are many things I have done in caring for Nimi. I just have to keep thinking outside the box. Especially as I do not have a tree that grows money at the back of my house nor can I plan a successful money heist, I just have to improvise.\n\nIn teaching Nimi, I discovered that her style of learning is first visual then audio. She is a lover of anything animated. Thankfully, most of her slides from her teacher comes with animated videos. After classes, I google the topics on Youtube and play different animated videos. She enjoys it and she has a photogenic memory.\n\nIt was an amazing experience for me when I discovered how she could learn through audio. When she was much younger, she couldn\u2019t turn her head from her left to her right. So, if she lay on the play mat and her left side was facing the TV, she wouldn\u2019t be able to watch but I noticed that she could follow the cartoon that she was watching by listening attentively. She would laugh to appropriate jokes and understand when the cartoon has come to an end. However visual comes first for her. \n\nWith her school work, she enjoys most of her subjects but I noticed she wasn\u2019t responding to Yoruba and French. I called her school teacher and told her that I was not going to bother her with the subjects. I also told her that she could continue with the subjects when she gets back to school. In Art class, I was the one drawing and painting so I told the art teacher there was no point. When school resumes, Art class can continue. There is just so much this mama can do.\n\nCont'd in the comment section.","NumberOfLikes":22,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Bukola Ayinde on August 20, 2020.

We are in the middle of a pandemic, I am pregnant, unable to work inside of my business.\n\nI had just started my career when the 2008 recession hit. The outcome of that recession was my ability to open my business and grow faster than I could have imagined. I have weathered a storm before and come out on top. This time it will look different but it won\u2019t be different, I am determined to figure this out.\n\nThis year has been a year of growth for me, In November of 2019 I sought out a mentor and began working on myself and my business. I had just made some decisions on the direction of my business in early March and started implementing those decisions when the pandemic hit. \n\nDays after my business was ordered to shut down I found out I was pregnant. That was an adjustment on it\u2019s own, but it forced me to slow down even more so than I typically would have during a time like this. This new world we all entered was unrecognizable, I have learned to accept a lot that would normally be unacceptable. I have been angry, devastated, broken, and lost just like everyone else. \n\nI have made a choice now to be grateful, I have been reminded that I cannot let situations control me that I have no control over. I have the ability and opportunity to make decisions for my life and my future. Making those decisions makes me feel like I am in control again.\n\nThe big question is, what do I want the future to look like? I know it will not be the same as it was before and for that I have gratitude. Something needed to change and this quickly put those changes in motion for me. \n\nSo now I am starting from scratch...trying to not put pressure on myself to have all the answers and a clear direction at this moment. What I have decided is that wherever I end up it will be where I am supposed to be.","NumberOfLikes":154,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Megan Giaimo in La Crescenta-Montrose with @lamag, @spearmintbaby, @thebump, @american_salon, @buybuybaby, @beautylaunchpad, @womenontopp, @babylist, @esteticamagazine, @beauty.brands, @salonmagazine, and @happiest_baby.

Some of these are running for House seats again, while others have been promoted by the Democratic Party leadership and are running for the US Senate. And an entire new crop of military-intelligence operatives is being brought forward, some running for Republican seats targeted by the Democratic leadership as possible takeovers, others in seats not currently considered competitive.\n\nAs we explained in 2018, the extraordinary influx of candidates coming directly from the national-security apparatus into the Democratic Party is a two-sided process: the Democratic Party establishment welcomes such candidates as a demonstration of the party\u2019s unshakeable devotion to the interests of American imperialism; and military-intelligence operatives are choosing the Democratic Party over the Republican Party in large numbers because they are attracted by the Democrats\u2019 non-stop campaign against the Trump administration as too \u201Csoft\u201D on Russia and too willing to pull out of the Middle East war zone.\n\nGo to WSWS.org to read more.

The antique phonograph re-embodies the human voice, allowing present-day listeners to commune with the past, even as it slips through their fingers.\n﻿\n﻿This year, globally, locally, and personally, we've undergone a surreal reworking of our notions of proxemics. Memories of touch & closeness are now tinged with greater nostalgia. Instances of touch & closeness are now laden with fear of exposure\/transmission. Antique phonograph listening, from the safety of one's parlor, is one way to connect from afar.\n﻿\n﻿2020 is the ideal time to revel in the delicate, bittersweet nature of this analog form of music listening: its immediacy, its tactility, its embrace of the ephemeral, and its yearning to reach across to the other side.\n﻿\n﻿In this memory of touch & closeness from \"Once & Again,\" subject Louis Waldman describes one of his favorite records, Leo Slezak's rendition of Schubert's \"Nacht und Traume\":\n﻿\n﻿\u201CIt always feels like you\u2019re a tiny child and he\u2019s your grandfather, sitting on the edge of your bed, singing right into your ear. You can hear, he must be singing right into the microphone, the newly invented microphone, because you can hear each breath becoming a note ... struggling to become a note ... and sometimes he doesn\u2019t even quite make the note \u2026 but then the note forms, and then it dies away, and then he breathes in and makes the next note. It\u2019s the closest thing I can possibly imagine to having someone sing right into your ear.\u201D\n﻿\n﻿#phonograph #musiclistening #proxemics #pandemic #touch #haptics #embodiment #seance #ephemeral #uncertainty #ether #connect #connection #closeness #waxcylinder #leoslezak #schubert #nacht #traume #ode #bittersweet","NumberOfLikes":22,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597952923,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 20 21:48:43 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"got that old-fashioned kinda love 🍒","NumberOfLikes":445,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Ali Collins in Dock's Oyster House with @urbanoutfitters, @rayban, and @docksoysterhouseac.

When you practice awareness in Asanas, pranayama, mantras & meditation we learn to let go, clear our minds of the busy clutter & Free our potential to create purely from inspiration!!! \n\nWhen I was asked a few years ago to create a mural for @thenestfl - I meditate upon what I wanted to create for this beautiful space!! There was large association with motherhood & amazing women & so I went in with a clear mind & blank canvas & inspired to create this Hamsa figure \n✨the lotus and the feminine symbol in the middle represent the flourishing femininity of womanhood \n✨the OM symbol in the center represents unification & harmony \n✨the rest of the floral designs & in between waves are the challenges along the way of womanhood & femininity that teach, help & allow us to grow to our full potential! \n\nAs women we have a responsibility to uplift our own individual vibration that in turn has a rippling effect in this universe! Art is personal & unique!!! There is truly no right or wrong but there is an essence or feeling; unity, release, joy!! \n\nI\u2019m so sad to hear that this place closed down during the #covid19 #pandemic but I\u2019m so happy for Ifat & all the wonderful work she keeps doing for this community now virtually too!!

In terms of other issues, they\u2019re really home-specific. We\u2019re hearing different things about different homes,\u201D said lawyer Stephen Birman.\n\nBirman is representing the $25 million claim against Carlingview\u2019s owner Revera Inc., one of four cases that his firm, Thomson Rogers, has launched against Ontario long-term care homes.\n\n\u201COne of the things we\u2019ve heard from families is the refusal to separate COVID and non-COVID-positive patients, for whatever reason,\u201D Birman says. \u201CFamily members observed repeat use of PPE [personal protective equipment] or potential use of contaminated PPE, and then we hear repeatedly with respect to all the homes, both directly and anecdotally, is just the massive staffing shortage during the pandemic period.\u201D\n\nAnother COVID-19 lawsuit claims that government pandemic edicts including forced business closures, compulsory face masks, and potentially mandatory vaccines are a breach of individual rights and freedoms protected by the Charter.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in July by Toronto lawyer Rocco Galati for Vaccine Choice Canada, Ontario Civil Liberties Association researcher Denis Rancourt, and six anonymous plaintiffs. Among other demands, the suit seeks \u201Ca declaration that the COVID measures taken by both [Prime Minister Justin] Trudeau and [Ontario Premier Doug] Ford, and their respective governments, at the blind and unquestioned dictates of the World Health Organization bureaucrats, constitute a constitutional violation of the abdication of the duty to govern.\u201D\n\nDefendants include Trudeau, Ford, Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam, Toronto Mayor John Tory, and a number of other federal and Ontario public officials.\n\n🖐🏾More in comments👇🏾#CoViD1984 - #regrann","NumberOfLikes":4,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Augustus Alexander on August 20, 2020.

Now, you all will be thinking that we regularly wash vegetables with water before we use them and hence the vegetables are ready to be cooked but , that's far from the truth and I discovered it recently when I read that water doesn't kill the germs, bacteria and virus that are present on the vegetables. Washing the vegetables with water merely cleans them but to get really get rid of the germs  and other vector borne viruses it is essential that we wash our vegetables with Veggie Clean from @marico_veggieclean. \n\nIt removes 99.9% germs and harmful pesticides.\nVery economical and easy to use. Made with 100% natural ingredients. \n\nI also want to bring home this point that, amidst the  covid 19 times, it is of utmost importance that we wash and clean our vegetables with Veggie Clean.\n\nIts a 5 minutes job - soak the vegetables and fruits for 5 mins in 2 litres of water mixed with one cap full of veggie clean.

According to Bloomberg, \u201CA special project by the Census Bureau has set out to map and measure all the anxieties that Covid-19 has brought in its wake.\u201D And the findings are alarming: Almost a third of people in some states have little or no confidence they can pay August\u2019s rent or mortgage. Almost 127 million Americans experienced a loss of income since mid-March, and millions were forced out of work dealing with the pandemic. Worse yet, people\u2019s health was adversely affected by the virus, even if they didn\u2019t catch it. In fact, in addition to high levels of anxiety and depression that the virus stirred, 71 million adults did not get medical care that they needed for a condition unrelated to Covid-19, between mid-June and mid-July.\n\nWe\u2019re clearly at a crossroads. Eventually, the government, any government that is elected, will have to make the necessary changes to secure people\u2019s well-being. Otherwise, the chaos we are already seeing in some cities will spread throughout the country.\n\nAlthough a pandemic is troublesome enough, Covid-19 is much more than that. The transformations it is imposing on us are not merely measures to curb its spreading; they are revolutionizing our entire civilization. The job losses we have experienced until now will dwarf compared to the job market that we will see in the near future. In fact, we are racing toward a reality where not working is the norm and working is the exception. In such circumstances, relief packages will not do; we will need a deep change in our perception of the concepts of work and society.","NumberOfLikes":77,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Kabbalist Dr. Michael Laitman on August 20, 2020.

I have been unable to return to work as I am both #asthmatic and #immunocompromised. \n- Additionally, though I saved quite a bit of money from my #unemployment, that money will run out within the next two months, leaving me in an incredibly vulnerable position. \n- This year has been especially difficult for all of us. I see that, I feel that. With the virus, loss of work opportunities, the death of my best friend, and the loss of a roommate there have been days where I have looked myself in the mirror and asked myself: can I do this? \n- Your continued love and support has shown me I can. It is so powerful to feel seen and heard as a #trans woman. Especially right now. Allies are a necessary part of my survival, and I want to survive.

In terms of other issues, they\u2019re really home-specific. We\u2019re hearing different things about different homes,\u201D said lawyer Stephen Birman.\n\nBirman is representing the $25 million claim against Carlingview\u2019s owner Revera Inc., one of four cases that his firm, Thomson Rogers, has launched against Ontario long-term care homes.\n\n\u201COne of the things we\u2019ve heard from families is the refusal to separate COVID and non-COVID-positive patients, for whatever reason,\u201D Birman says. \u201CFamily members observed repeat use of PPE [personal protective equipment] or potential use of contaminated PPE, and then we hear repeatedly with respect to all the homes, both directly and anecdotally, is just the massive staffing shortage during the pandemic period.\u201D\n\nAnother COVID-19 lawsuit claims that government pandemic edicts including forced business closures, compulsory face masks, and potentially mandatory vaccines are a breach of individual rights and freedoms protected by the Charter.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in July by Toronto lawyer Rocco Galati for Vaccine Choice Canada, Ontario Civil Liberties Association researcher Denis Rancourt, and six anonymous plaintiffs. Among other demands, the suit seeks \u201Ca declaration that the COVID measures taken by both [Prime Minister Justin] Trudeau and [Ontario Premier Doug] Ford, and their respective governments, at the blind and unquestioned dictates of the World Health Organization bureaucrats, constitute a constitutional violation of the abdication of the duty to govern.\u201D\n\nDefendants include Trudeau, Ford, Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam, Toronto Mayor John Tory, and a number of other federal and Ontario public officials.\n\n🖐🏾More in comments👇🏾#CoViD1984","NumberOfLikes":771,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Exposing Lies & Sharing Truth on August 20, 2020.","NumberOfComments":9,"Timestamp":1597939729,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 20 18:08:49 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#Dancing in the #desert on my way from #LA to #vegas.
