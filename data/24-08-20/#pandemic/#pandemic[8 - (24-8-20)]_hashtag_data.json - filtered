If knowledge is the modus operandi to the how, the why, the when, someone like Anurag becomes a resource by himself \u2013 to artists, gallerists and fellow collectors!\u2063\n \u2063\n Equally interesting, when a young lad originating from Dhanbad (a coal mining town in Bihar) and currently living in Gandhidham in Kutch goes on to become India\u2019s first collector of conceptual art \u2013 whether it was Walid Raad, Bani Abidi (@bani_abidi), Naeem Mohaiemen, Akram Zaatari (@akramzaatari) or even Tillmans (@wolfgang_tillmans ) (before he became the superstar he is today)\u2063\n \u2063\n Whether it was traversing galleries in Berlin in the summertime when gallerists gave him their time or scouring Swiss museums and galleries - much of these travels began to inform his journey as a collector.\u2063\n \u2063\n The collection began to take curatorial form when Anurag designed his office to become the curatorial lab of his collection. Video art, photographs, minimally hung \u2013 telling potent stories, of gender, sexuality, personal histories (all in Gandhidham, I daresay!)\u2063\n \u2063\n If my journey with Anurag has been stilted only because his proclivities took him to other shores- there has been a circle of love that brought him back obsessing with the work of late Mehlli Gobhai. After the 2008 crash, Gobhai\u2019s exhibition in 2011 was a commercial washout. It pained the artist \u2013 but years later, Anurag returned back to the show he saw 7 years earlier \u2013 few would know how much vigour this infused in Gobhai\u2019s flagging morale. For Anurag, this was an incubation period before he returned back to collecting paintings! \u2063","NumberOfLikes":267,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":28,"Timestamp":1597938633,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 20 17:50:33 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"According to recent studies, Coronavirus can spread through urinal particles while you flush urine in public toilets.

I now have to get a tooth extracted. I missed my 3 month recall due to lockdown. üòë\n\n#Repost @drlizzzt with @make_repost\n„Éª„Éª„Éª\nThe WHO recently released a statement advising that \"routine non-essential oral health care \u2013 which usually includes oral health check-ups, dental cleanings and preventive care \u2013 be delayed until there has been sufficient reduction in COVID-19 transmission rates.\"\n\nAs a dental professional, I see this as just one more way that we have separated the mouth from the rest of the body.  We complain about dental insurance being different than medical insurance...this isn't much different...we aren't considering the oral complex part of the body.  Since we were closed from March until May (and donated our PPE to those that needed it most), we are now seeing patients who are even just a month or two overdue for their cleanings.  I'm seeing much more inflammation, plaque buildup, dry mouth, redness of the gingiva...all related to missing a visit, and made even worse by an increase in mouth breathing with mask wearing (seal your üëÑ people!)\n\nThe ADA\u2019s guidance calls for the highest level of PPE available\u2014masks, goggles and face shields.  Dr. Gehani states, \u201CMillions of patients have safely visited their dentists in the past few months for the full range of dental services. With appropriate PPE, dental care should continue to be delivered during global pandemics or other disaster situations.\u201D We wear scrubs, two gowns that are changed between each patient, an N95 with a level 3 mask over that, eye protection, head coverings, and a face shield.  We are protected, and we are protecting you.  There have been no instances of a patient becoming infected in a dental office, and no instances of a dental professional contracting COVID from a patient.\n\nBe an informed consumer.  Ask what your dentist is doing to take precautions for COVID.  And recognize the importance of oral health...go to the dentist!\n\n#dentist #dentalhygienist #dentalassistant #team #quarantine #covid19 #coronavirus #immunesystem #wearamask #oralsurgery #emergency #wecare #weloveourpatients #essentialworkers #essentialhealth #flattenthecurve #pandemic #ada #who #wholehealth #dentistry","NumberOfLikes":5,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Suzanne Ko on August 20, 2020.

Ironically, it also became the chant of millions on the streets of India against the project of Hindu nationalism.\nEven as Arundhati Roy began to ask what lay between these two calls for freedom-a chasm or a bridge?-the streets fell silent. Not only in India but all over the world. Covid-19 brought with it another, more terrible, understanding of Azadi, making a nonsense of international borders, incarcerating whole populations, and bringing the modern world to a halt like nothing else ever could.\nIn this series of electrifying essays, Arundhati Roy challenges us to reflect on the meaning of freedom in a world of growing authoritarianism.\nThe essays include meditations on language, public as well as private, and on the role of fiction and alternative imaginations in these disturbing times. The pandemic, Roy says, is a portal between one world and another. For all the illness and devastation it has left in its wake, it is an invitation to the human race, an opportunity, to imagine another world.\n\n#azad√Æ #kashmiri #pandemic #essays #hindunationalism #islam #pluralism #freedom \n#newbookstagram #bookblogger #booknerd #bookworm #fascism #varanasibookshop #assighat #readwithharmony \n\n@penguinindia \n@harmonythebookshop","NumberOfLikes":5,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Harmony The Book Shop on August 20, 2020 tagging @arundhati433.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597931800,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 20 15:56:40 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"üíûexclusive collection\nüìûcall\/whatsapp@+918698463515\n‚úàÔ∏èdelivery all over india\n.\n.\n.\nüéÄLike and share with ur frndsüéÄ\nüíåleave ur comment and emojisüíì\n#mumbaifashioncity#fashionhub#abaya#designerdress#delhi#mumbai#saree#kurti#suits#bridalcollection#plazoset#corona#coronavirus#pandemic#fightback#onlineshopping#buy#trend#shopüõçüõíprettythingz‚ú®üñ§üíú","NumberOfLikes":4,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597931796,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 20 15:56:36 CEST 2020","Location":"Mumtaz City"},{"CaptionText":"These elasticated 3 Ply disposable face masks fit loosely around your mouth and nose.

As a pass holder, we usually went, ride our fast passes, grabbed a treat and left. \n\nThere are not any fireworks, no character meet and greets, no parades, no shows, most shops are closed and there are sparse \u201Ctreat\u201D stands. To a family coming for the first time, it sounds kind of like a spoiled trip, which it can be, if that\u2019s what you came for. \n\nWe\u2019ve stood in lines before. 45 minutes for Big Thunder. 90 minutes for mine train. My kids have only ever rode space mountain once because it\u2019s wildly popular. Don\u2019t get me started on the time we stood in line for 3 hours for Flight of Passage, or tried for literally hours to get a fast pass. Or waiting all day for our que to maybe be called for the Star Wars ride... \nNow for the nitty gritty. We waited maybe 20 minutes max for any single ride. Most were 5 minute waits. Some of them we had the entire ride to ourselves.  After coming off some rides, they didn\u2019t even make us exit all the way to circle around to ride again, they just sent us straight to the beginning of the ride. üéâ \n\nTo order food it was mainly through mobile ordering, which is fine, it saved me from digging through my bag to find my credit card. \n\nYes, they are very big on wearing a mask. Yes the rumor is true that there are garbage cans every 15 feet, but, hand sanitizer every 10 feet.  Hand washing stations everywhere and bathrooms to wash hands.  We constantly saw them cleaning the rides, railings, ropes etc. \nconsidering I caught Covid here in March, I would lick most surfaces there now.

Equating them uses the false equivalence fallacy. \n\nFalse equivalence is where someone conflates one (or a few) commonalities between very different entities and concludes them as being equivalent. It\u2019s like comparing apples to oranges, or in some cases, apples to moon rocks, or Coors Lite to Sam Adams. \n\nYes, wearing a mask and living in fear both have attributes associated with protection. But that's not quite enough to conclude equivalence. Living in fear is on a whole other level of suspiscion and emotional anxiety than simply wearing a protective device for the situation at hand. \nConcluding equivalence based on this is therefore less supported than my Patreon acount. (Speaking of, shout out to my five patrons! I'm slowly climbing to mediocre! Much love to ya!) \n\nOn that note, please wear a #mask and attenuate the spread of #coronavirus so we can get back to the important discussions, like denouncing the heathens trying to deny pineapples on pizza or those weirdos that don't drink coffee because they get enough sleep. \n\nFor more on false equivalence:\n\nhttps:\/\/sgtscholar.wordpress.com\/2019\/06\/30\/false-equivalence\/\n\nCarpe Datum and Semper Sci!\n[Sgt Scholar Actual]\n\n#criticalthinking #badsciencejokes #ScienceMatters #scicomm #logic #education #science #STEM #badjokes #funnymemes #funny #wearamaskplease #COVID #health #pandemic #nerdhumor #geekhumor #funnytweets #funnybuttrue #fallacies #combatvet #veteran #driving #condoms #safesex #PSA #safety #masks4canada","NumberOfLikes":93,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Dr. Mathew Plant in Toronto, Ontario.

Whenever I think of those FUN good ol\u2019 days I think of our large group of friends, and one of them was John Michael Cantu. I\u2019ve known him since 2nd grade...such a great friend, sweet and very very funny! Our large group walked to Shields school, then on to Howell middle school everyday all the way thru like the first year of High-school. I had met Becky Serna Cantu sometime during middle school. \nLife happens, and well we all went our separate ways. They married and every now and then we\u2019d run into each other. Same ol\u2019 crazy funny John. \nThey both became ill with COVID a couple of weeks ago. His wife Becky passed away last week and was buried this morning.

I discuss Tuesday's historic judgment in the Ayyash et al case at the Special Tribunal for Lebanon (STL) in The Netherlands. \n\nThe trial focused on pursuing accountability for the 2005 assassination of Rafik Hariri, the former Prime Minister of Lebanon and 21 others. Link below or in bio. \n\n\u201CIt is also uncertain whether remote justice delivered in The Netherlands, far from Lebanon and without the presence of any of the accused, is actually justice, or rather merely expensive symbolism. The Tribunal\u2019s judgment is a small part of what is needed for justice in Lebanon in all of its manifestations, particularly given the protracted civil war, numerous political assassinations which have been perpetrated with impunity and the recent massive explosion. The Hariri assassination is but one tragic event alongside many others that need a legitimate justice response.\n\nWhether or not the Tribunal provided justice for Lebanon, as it claims, only the Lebanese people and the victims can judge. It certainly does not feel like justice.\"\n\n#internationallaw #lebanon #beirut #stl #thehague #thenetherlandsüá≥üá± #international #justice #crime #criminal #prosecutions #trials #opinion #discussion #discussion #funding #civilwar #primeminister #politics #political #world #events #publishing #writing #pandemic #thoughts #writings #court #trial #news","NumberOfLikes":22,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Shannon Maree Torrens on August 20, 2020.

Selain widely available, murah juga harganya. Ketika wabah dimulai, harga masker dan hand sanitizer jadi menggila. Aku pun jadi sadar bahwa masker medis itu gak sustainable karena sekali pakai terus dibuang. Praktis sih, tapi nyampah, dan cost-nya jadi gede banget. Masalahnya, masker kain tuh kebanyakan gak nyaman. Sementara sekarang udah mulai wfo sebagian kan, jadi harus pakai masker dong untuk melindungi diri dan orang lain..\nUntungnya sekarang ada masker kain model 3d dari @mask_good.id . Maskernya gak pengap karena ada ruang nafas yg lega, talinya juga hijab-friendly yg bisa diatur sesuai ukuran kepala, dan motifnya pun cantik-cantik jadi aku bisa mix-and-match sesuai outfit aku! üòÑ \nDibawa kerja di ruang ber-AC nyaman, dipakai jalan juga nyaman.\n\nKepoin dulu IG-nya di @mask_good.id\nMereka habis ngeluarin motif-motif baru, tuh!\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n#mask #facemask #corona #coronavirus #quarantine #stayhome #hijab #hijabootd #hijaber #pandemi #covid19 #virus #pandemic #selfcare","NumberOfLikes":7,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Masker Wajah Mask Good on August 20, 2020.

So don\u2019t put your #investment decisions and financial planning on hold just to wait for the situation to become normal.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has brought the world to a standstill. Probably, this is one of the biggest crises in the last 75 years. However, the pandemic is temporary and most of us are going to sail through this tough time. Moreover, experiencing such a difficult time makes us better prepared for the future.

A crisis like this can keep people out of the job #market for a very long time and also bring unexpected large medical expenditures. We should be prepared for the worst and make the necessary arrangements to make sure we get to live our normal life.\n\nHaving an emergency fund of at least two years of expenditure could give us adequate protection to fight any future unforeseen circumstances. Individuals should keep emergency funds in low-risk and liquid fixed-income #assets.\n\nùêëùêûùêúùêöùê•ùêúùêÆùê•ùêöùê≠ùêû ùê≤ùê®ùêÆùê´ ùê¢ùêßùê¨ùêÆùê´ùêöùêßùêúùêû ùêßùêûùêûùêùùê¨\n\nA good health #insurance plan is a must for all.

It is extremely relevant today for obvious reasons. In this video you will see a company in Georgia situated near train tracks with acres and acres of plastic Fema Coffins. I literally just read today that Georgia is in the red zone with one of the highest rates of covid and covid deaths. Coincidence??? 11 years ago it was suspected that there were at least 2 million coffins stockpiled. Anyone care to guess how many coffins they have stockpiled right now? \n\nFastforward a decade and we conveniently have a plandemic killing citizens in record numbers. Plandemic meaning planned scheduled intentional creation & release of a biological weapon worldwide!  Let us not forget all of the other biological weapons we have been exposed to; anthrax, SARs Swine Flu & Ebola to name a few. Each outbreak did its part to decrease the population & generate fear. \n\n.\n\nDid they ever give an official explanation what these coffins are for?\n\n.\n\nRemember about 6 years ago when Walmart stores were closing all over the country? There was speculation that these Walmarts were being turned into FEMA camps. I often joke that Walmart is an extension of the government. Now we have massive business closings & people are losing their homes. We're experiencing the beginnings of a concocted food shortage while fighting a biological war. With businesses closing almost all of their brick-and-mortar stores I wonder what those buildings will be utilized for?

So don\u2019t put your #investment decisions and financial planning on hold just to wait for the situation to become normal.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has brought the world to a standstill. Probably, this is one of the biggest crises in the last 75 years. However, the pandemic is temporary and most of us are going to sail through this tough time. Moreover, experiencing such a difficult time makes us better prepared for the future.

A crisis like this can keep people out of the job #market for a very long time and also bring unexpected large medical expenditures. We should be prepared for the worst and make the necessary arrangements to make sure we get to live our normal life.\n\nHaving an emergency fund of at least two years of expenditure could give us adequate protection to fight any future unforeseen circumstances. Individuals should keep emergency funds in low-risk and liquid fixed-income #assets.\n\nùêëùêûùêúùêöùê•ùêúùêÆùê•ùêöùê≠ùêû ùê≤ùê®ùêÆùê´ ùê¢ùêßùê¨ùêÆùê´ùêöùêßùêúùêû ùêßùêûùêûùêùùê¨\n\nA good health #insurance plan is a must for all. If it\u2019s family insurance then coverage definitely needs to be higher than Rs 5 lakh. Investors should consider having low-cost top-up insurance to increase the coverage amount. Further, adequate term insurance for the main earning member of the family is necessary.\n\nùêëùêûùêØùê¢ùê¨ùê¢ùê≠ ùê≤ùê®ùêÆùê´ ùêüùê¢ùêßùêöùêßùêúùê¢ùêöùê• ùê†ùê®ùêöùê•ùê¨\n\nTraveling and large social gatherings are two things that are stopped due to this crisis.

In April, they lost 17.7 million jobs. But by July, their losses had swelled to 18.9 million,\u201D CMIE boss Mahesh Vyas noted in a recent post.\n\n\u201CWhile salaried jobs are not lost easily, once lost they are also far more difficult to retrieve. Therefore, their ballooning numbers are a source of worry. Salaried jobs were nearly 19 million short of their average in 2019-20. They were 22% lower than their level in the last fiscal year,\u201D the post said.\n\nThis is in sharp contrast to informal and non-salaried jobs, which have shown improvement during the same period, increasing to 325.6 million in July from 317.6 million last year, an increase of 2.5%, the post noted.\n\nAt the beginning of the lockdown, informal jobs \u2013 particularly daily-wage labourers, hawkers and small traders \u2013 were worst hit in April.\n\nMore in link in bio.\n.\n.\n.\n\n#india #indianeconomy #economy #lockdown #covid19 #coronavirus #gocoronago #pandemic #indiafightscorona #maskoff #unemployment #jobs #salaried #salary #formal #dataisbeautiful #data #statistics #disappointing #reliance #recession #entrepreneurs #investors #investment #government #governance #finance","NumberOfLikes":1908,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The Wire on August 19, 2020.

WEAR YOUR MASK!!!!!\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to wear one, don\u2019t go out in public.  Have someone else (who will wear a mask) run errands for you.  I am so sick and tired of going to Kroger, school, and the pharmacy and witnessing people not wearing masks at all, or not wearing them correctly.\n\nThe mask should cover your nose and chin.  Newsflash, air particles come out of your nose when you breathe.  Your nose HAS to be covered for the mask to completely do what it\u2019s supposed to do.\n\nWhile I\u2019m at it, social distance, please.  I understand that sometimes you can\u2019t avoid passing by other people, but that\u2019s why you should be wearing a mask; it protects them and you!  I have always enjoyed having my personal space, and have found that social distancing isn\u2019t difficult and allows me space to simply exist. \n\nQuit being selfish and just wear the mask.  Also, make sure you\u2019re not touching all over them while wearing, and WASH them so you don\u2019t end up with a dirty, disgusting mask.\n\nDo your part.

Most people infected will experience a mild to moderate respiratory illness, whilst others will show no symptoms at all. However for some the effects are severe and longer lasting.\n\nOur aim in this yoga programme is to play some role in aiding the process of recovery. By only requiring the use of mostly basic props and furniture, we have tried to make the poses as accessible as possible for everyone.\n\nThe programme was compiled thanks to advice and guidance from Abhijata Iyengar, Lois Steinberg, Gulnaaz Dashti, Stephanie Quirk, the IY(UK) Therapy Committee, IY(UK) teachers who have experienced the virus themselves, and decades of work by BKS Iyengar and Dr Geeta S. Iyengar in medical classes at RIMYI in Pune.\n\nSee the link in our bio to access the video and booklet, which are both freely available. Please consider donating a contribution towards this and future Iyengar yoga therapy resources üôè\n\nThanks to all involved in creating the programme and to @adrienne_karmaspaceyoga for designing the e-book\n\n#iyengaryoga #yogatherapy #covid19 #covid_19 #coronavirus #recovery #covidhelp #yogaforhealing #yoga #mypandemicsurvivalplan #sarscov2 #pandemic #pandemic2020 #staysafe #virus #postcovid #yogapractice #loveyoga #yogateachers  #iyengarmethod #yogadaily #practiceyoga #yogisofinstagram #yogajourney","NumberOfLikes":3,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by #learniyengar on August 19, 2020.

Rajagopalachari, the last governor-general of India before the nation became a republic, wrote, \u201CA country without material, men or money \u2013 the three means of power \u2013 is now fast coming to be recognised as the biggest moral power in the civilised world \u2026 her word listened to with respect in the councils of the great.\u201D\n\nIs India still the reservoir of that moral influence? Recently it was widely reported that Sheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of Bangladesh, has not met India\u2019s high commissioner despite repeated requests for a meeting in the last four months. Many commentators say Bangladesh is tilting toward China. As one after another of India\u2019s immediate neighbours in South Asia turn away from India, it is time to contemplate where the country\u2019s foreign policy might be failing us and the expectations of our neighbours?\n\nIn school, I recall being taught that India is a \u2018big brother\u2019 to its smaller neighbours. Whether this \u2018smaller\u2019 meant geographical size or was a metaphor alluding to an inferior status remains lost. The entire academic grounding of international relations calls for a serious reckoning. When we don\u2019t view our neighbours as equals and assume an air of superiority, even though it may come from a supposed sense of responsibility for the region, it automatically negates any possibility of friendship. Rather, it becomes a relationship of \u2018give and take\u2019 or one that tenuously hangs on to historical and cultural associations.\n\nMore in link in bio.\n.\n.\n.\n\n#india #indianpolitics #politics #internationalrelations #externalaffairs #southasia #southeastasia #bigbrother #trade #covid19 #coronavirus #pandemic #gocoronago #nepal #srilanka #bhutan #bengal #westbengal #china #independence #identity #pakistan #bjp #bharatiyajanataparty #modi #namo #bigbrother","NumberOfLikes":7194,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The Wire on August 19, 2020.
