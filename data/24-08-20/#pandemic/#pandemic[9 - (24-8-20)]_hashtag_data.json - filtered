Our \u201Ccorrectional\u201D system has failed them. Across the country, inmates are locked down, they are receiving minimal contact with other humans- they are alone. These people are at a heightened risk for exposure to COVID-19. I listen to @_terrancelewis_iaminnocent speak about his experiences as an exoneree. He has been in their shoes. His stories are impactful. His strength is inspiring. His insight towards the darkness of being locked away and given only a bologna sandwich and an apple 3x a day is illuminating. There is no question that social distancing is a must. But we must treat all American citizens with dignity and respect- this includes incarcerated citizens. Being inside a prison does not take away a person\u2019s humanity. Prison inmates have a constitutional right to have their basic needs met and to have their health protected.

A Mostra terá também projeções no drive-in Petra Belas Artes e títulos gratuitos disponíveis nas plataformas do Cinesesc e da Spcine. A edição deste ano acontecerá entre 22 de outubro e 4 de novembro.\n\nPor conta da mudança do formato (ainda não há informação se haverá sessões presenciais, tampouco se continuará o sistema de pacotes de ingressos), a 44ª Mostra vai exibir cerca de 150 títulos dos mais diversos países. \n\nAté o momento estão confirmadas produções da Alemanha, Argentina, Bolívia, Canadá, China, EUA, Finlândia, França, Grécia, Hungria, Irã, Japão, Líbano, México, Noruega, Palestina, Portugal, Suíça, Síria e Turquia.\n\nPara o cartaz desta edição, foi convidado o diretor chinês Jia Zhangke, que terá seu mais recente longa, Nadando até o Mar Ficar Azul, na seleção do evento. \n\nO filme foi gravado na região da cidade natal do diretor, Fnyang, que hoje é referência cultural para artistas e escritores do país. Zhangke é o embaixador cultural da região e há três anos criou um festival de cinema e lançou recentemente um festival literário.\n\nJá o Prêmio Humanidade, que homenageia grandes nomes do cinema, será conferido aos funcionários da Cinemateca Brasileira, recentemente demitidos como causa do grave problema de gestão enfrentado pela instituição.\n\nLink na bio.\n\nFonte: Estadão\n\n#covid19 #coronavirus #ONN #onovonormal #ONNpoliticapublica #covidart #covid2020, #covid19brasil #covidmask #covidphotodiaries #covidnews #covid19art #corona #coronavírus #coronavirusbrazil #coronaviruspandemic #coronavirusoutbreak #coronavirus2020 #pandemic #pandemicart #pandemic2020, #pandemicorona #pandemiclife","NumberOfLikes":28,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#coronavirus","#ONN","#onovonormal","#ONNpoliticapublica","#covidart","#covid2020,","#covid19brasil","#covidmask","#covidphotodiaries","#covidnews","#covid19art","#corona","#coronavírus","#coronavirusbrazil","#coronaviruspandemic","#coronavirusoutbreak","#coronavirus2020","#pandemic","#pandemicart","#pandemic2020,","#pandemicorona","#pandemiclife"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by O Novo Normal in São Paulo, Brazil.

(In my defense the #art is SO ridiculously #stunning ....) I collect #tarot decks, have poured through plenty of companion books, and hadn\u2019t ever encountered a book that actually elevated my experience of the imagery. \n\nBut since embarking upon this new #creative chapter, i pulled out the book the other day when I held the #alien in my hand and found myself genuinely curious as to how and why it had replaced the #hermit\n\nAnd.......This! Book! 😍🥰\n\nFor this card, the description begins with \u201CI USE WHAT RESTRICTS TO EXPAND.\u201D\n\nThe #pandemic has generated some hardcore, heinous restrictions. And I often lose #hope (and\/or lose MYSELF entirely) when grappling with the restrictions of being a #singlemom too. Been reeeeeally thrashing around & feeling all kinds of #stuck on many levels.\n\nBut this card\u2019s description dives deep into a crucible \/ heat-and-pressure-convert-coal-to-diamond \/ pressure cooker sorta interpretation. One phrase that especially snagged my attention was:\n\n\u201CWhen we take away all options except complete fulfillment then something within us is powerfully directed towards that objective.\u201D\n\n(Cue \u201CUnder Pressure\u201D 🎼)\n\nIt also talks about how you can have ample resources at your disposal but you won\u2019t necessarily create something great \u201Cunless those resources are channeled through the small discerning aperture of a great idea.\u201D\n\nSo.

If you grew up in the 80\u2019s, this album will connect you with the music that backed almost any sci-fi, fantasy or horror movie you loved way back then.  Do yourself a favor and give this one a spin.  Probably the most accessible track is \u201CHey Moon\u201D, but almost all of them have a sound that will drag you down a rabbit hole of wanting to hear more of his work. \n\n-\n\nSonically, Maus works a minimal, primitive setup: sputtering drum machines and an arsenal of 1980s-vintage synth presets undercut his lyrics just as much as those exaggerated, often grotesque vocal turns do. Sometimes, these songs seem to exist solely to pose questions: Top 40 cheese or ironic cool? High-brow or low-brow? Honesty or posturing? Artifice or reality? But what makes We Must Become his finest full-length yet is how fluidly he communicates it all by foregrounding melody. On \"Keep Pushing On\", Maus' monastic, cellar-level singing lends the song the feel of a Gregorian chant-led exercise tape. Though the vocals and basslines on arpeggiated fever dream \"Quantum Leap\" mirror Joy Division's to an almost cartoonish degree, you still get a good sense of Maus' persona in the music. There's a genuine, almost maniacal sense of glee in the way he seems to approach each turn. - David Bevan - Pitchfork - A score of 8.4 out of 10 \n\n#JohnMaus #wemustbecomethepitilesscensorsofourselves #vinyl #vinyllove #vinylporn #vinyllover #vinylrecord #vinylcollection #vinyljunkie #vinylrecords #vinyladdict #vinylcollector #vinylcommunity #vinylcollectionpost #love #quarantine #pandemic #music #vinylcollector\n\n- \n\nListening to only one song on an album is like looking at only one corner of a painting.

Her first day consisted of a scheduled book pick up, with her mask, so she could meet her teacher in person and see what her classroom will look like when she, eventually, goes to school 🏫 \nShe was nervous, and truthfully so was I! Her and I sat in the car for a minute before walking in, and talked through the all of the different feelings. We were both so excited for her to start school, but we were also nervous because this is something new. We love that she gets to spend the time at home with us, but we're also overwhelmed because that is a LOT of time at home. We are pumped about her curriculum and the amount she is going to be learning by time this year is over... But we also feel like deer in the head lights because neither one of us know how we are going to get this all done, on our own, while I'm on bedrest, with Evie present, during a pandemic 😳\nIn short, we're excited, but we have no idea what we're doing 😂 So, together, we are going to take this this one small step at a time; while learning every step of the way, and making a million mistakes 💕 \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#daybyday #school #kindergarten #pandemic #covid #new #overwhelmed #excited #momlife #home #blessed","NumberOfLikes":59,"Hashtags":["#daybyday","#school","#kindergarten","#pandemic","#covid","#new","#overwhelmed","#excited","#momlife","#home","#blessed"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":6,"Timestamp":1597865981,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 19 21:39:41 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"this isn\u2019t something i usually post...but i think all of us need some feel good stories right now. \n.\n.\n.\nThese two teens haven\u2019t seen each other since the start of the pandemic.

Was also looking forward to the lovely cantaloupe I had just gotten, only to find it all rotten inside. A perfect metaphor for how life has felt the past month. \n\nIf your life has mostly stayed the same during this #pandemic if you've been lucky enough to do work that has #survived or even thrived amidst this, be  grateful & be kind to those of us who are having a totally different experience. Those of us in the #serviceindustries are REALLY struggling. I reinvested pretty much all the money I got from unemployment into education and new services, yet the combination of reopening too soon, this administration being a #disgrace in regards to #leadership or #science and the good old #maskrebels out there, those of us in the service industry are being forced to \"go back to work\" even when the clientele and customer base is a teeny fraction of what it was. My work involves being inches away from people's face and body for long periods of time in small spaces. We are expected to social distance in public yet somehow #dora thinks giving a client a #facial while they have no mask on, and I'm 6 inches away from their face, is fine and we should be getting back to it? It's #insane\n\nI took ON more overhead amidst all off this, to rent a space to provide new services since my workplace wellness company has been completely lost in all of this. That was about %90 of my income. So to anyone who thinks those of us who WERE managing to stay afloat and pay our mortgages (from my savings) due to getting unemployment for a few months, were just lazy and taking advantage - think again. Everything I got went right back into the economy - to education and supplies trying to pivot with my #work I've been self employed for over 20 years. Never once collected unemployment. Never once taken more than a long weekend off unless I was sick, and I've gone years without a vacation. I've never once had a paid vacation or #sickdays I've worked my ass off. As have millions of others in the same boat . So check yourself before you bitch about the #pandemic ruining your summer plans.

Andrew may not be able to understand my mental health problems, but he does a great job at trying to help me through them. I love him for that and for the patience he\u2019s learned that does not come naturally to him.\n\nThis week: my anxiety is through the roof. A panic attack yesterday just about ruined my day. I went to bed wanting to cry and felt that way when I woke up, still. My energy level is non-existent. I\u2019m constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop. I had an asthma attack Sunday and it reminds me how mortal and vulnerable I am, despite how healthy I try to be or how much I try to workout. It\u2019s already an emotional week for personal reasons, but add everything else in and things are easily overwhelming.\n\nYou see my cute dogs. My caring husband. My workout videos. My travel and handstand photos.\n\nMany people tell me \u201CI want what you have.\u201D\n\nWell, I just want to be care-free like so many people. I want the state of happiness to come easily to me.

I wish my mental health issues didn\u2019t have to burden my husband, when he already has so much to handle in life, too.\n\nAnd yet, I try to feel gratitude for the things I do have. For the good days that exist amidst the bad. This week is a string of bad. Hopefully, next week will be a string of good.

Science is testable and predictable\u2014it stands true, whether you believe it or not. \nWhile the terms outbreak, epidemic and pandemic are sometimes used synonymously\u2014they are different in scope and scale.  An \u201Coutbreak\u201D is classified as the sudden increase in occurrence of a particular disease which is generally greater than expected in a specific community or region. An Epidemic is an outbreak that spreads rapidly over a larger geographic area. Once an epidemic reaches global proportions affecting multiple countries or regions of the world, it is considered a pandemic. In the case of this meme, the Plague of 1720 was NOT a pandemic, it was the last major \"outbreak\" of the Bubonic Plague in Western Europe. The Cholera Pandemic began in 1817 (not 1820) and it lasted to 1824. Erroneously the meme claims  that the Spanish Flu occurred in 1920. The first identified cases of Spanish Flu were in March of 1918. By all conservative estimates, the Spanish Flu lasted from 1918 to 1920 (to be clear..it didn't start in 1920, it ended in 1920). History is always problematic to those who dont research. \nWe can't \"cherry-pick\" a small amount of data, while completely ignoring a much larger body of related data that doesn\u2019t fit our desired pattern. Pandemics have been charted long before the 18th century. The meme made no allowance for all the pandemics that spanned years prior and didnt end in 20 (which might suggest a completely different pattern, or none at all). The listing shared no substantive commonality (such as underlying disease, geographic area, duration, extent) that was indicative of any meaningful pattern. Science involves methodology--being able to understand statistics and data and interpret them in a sound logical manner-->Not willy-nilly beliefs or opinions with no factual basis. \n#StayOffYouTube #virus #facts #pandemic  #covid #science","NumberOfLikes":2,"Hashtags":["#StayOffYouTube","#virus","#facts","#pandemic","#covid","#science"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Myth Slayer on August 19, 2020.

The truth is, it's hard to talk about. We're taught not to talk about family planning, having kids at a later age and the guilt, shame and confusion we feel around getting pregnant in our 30s and 40s, but I decided I wanted to talk with you about it today! \n\nMy husband and I were planning on trying to conceive early this year. It wasn't an easy decision, despite the fact that we're both in our late 30s, for a multitude of reasons, BUT we were finally preparing to take the plunge. I started on a prenatal vitamin, talked to my OBGYN and we were getting ready to pull the trigger when... a global pandemic hit and we went into quarantine! \n\nAt first, we thought we'd just delay for a bit, but without a vaccine and without any certainty that we'd get to go through this big journey without friends and family by our sides we put ourselves in a holding pattern. \n\nThat's why I like to talk about taking control of your fertility and extending fertility as far into our 30s and 40s as we can. It's because I want to have confidence that when we're ready, when this whole dang crazy world is a little more settled, we'll be able to get pregnant in a reasonable amount of time and get our family back on track! \n\nHow about you? Did the #Pandemic delay your pregnancy plans? It's not easy to talk about, but I want to hear your story and start a conversation!

It was much needed.\n\nIt's been especially difficult as school starts back up. Yesterday during summer school, I was chatting with a parent at pick up time on my playground. An older sibling was with the parent. During the conversation, we heard someone calling out this child's name - \"Hi Molly!\" It was Molly's kindergarten teacher from last year, \"Mrs. Kimmel \". Mrs. Kimmel's three classroom windows face my playground. The windows were open with all the screens in place. Mrs. Kimmel was yelling Molly's name to get her attention. When Molly saw that it was Mrs Kimmel, her face lit up. Five year old Molly had a mask on and she ran towards the window. Mrs Kimmel became noticably distressed by the proximity, despite being inside, having a mask on and the window screen barriers. Molly was at least six feet away at this point when Mrs. Kimmel says, \"Molly, that's close enough. Don't go past that point.\" Molly's face fell, wondering what she did wrong. \n\nMrs Kimmel was in school preparing her classroom. She will have to move most of the furniture out of her classroom into a storage area. Five year old children will be assigned a yoga mat to sit on for the majority of the day. They will not be allowed to leave their classroom and will have to wear a mask for the entirety of the school day. They will have to remain 3 to 6 ft apart and will not be able to share materials or play cooperatively with each other.\n\nLet us not downplay the pandemic. But let us also not forget that the decisions we make as a society have an impact on our children. At what point do the negatives outweigh the positives? At what point do we know we've gone beyond caution and are succumbing to fear and scrupulosity? \n\n#rainbow #lakelife #blackdog #school #pandemic","NumberOfLikes":10,"Hashtags":["#rainbow","#lakelife","#blackdog","#school","#pandemic"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597859735,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 19 19:55:35 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Congratulations to y\u2019all that got yours  #lotto #lottowinner #lottosport #mavisvermillion #mavis #claim #claimittakeitownitrockit #win #money #legit #lottery #lotterywinner #jackpot #winning #usa🇺🇸 #florida #covi̇d19 #virus #pandemic #pandemic2020 #covi̇d_19","NumberOfLikes":1,"Hashtags":["#lotto","#lottowinner","#lottosport","#mavisvermillion","#mavis","#claim","#claimittakeitownitrockit","#win","#money","#legit","#lottery","#lotterywinner","#jackpot","#winning","#usa🇺🇸","#florida","#covi̇d19","#virus","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#covi̇d_19"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Covid19lottery_ on August 19, 2020.

Essas indústrias empregam 20% de todos os trabalhadores em todo o mundo, sendo o varejo o maior empregador do setor privado do mundo. \n\nAlém de lutas comerciais surpreendentes e até mesmo de fracassos, a pandemia também obrigou a um colapso muito necessário de antigas ortodoxas sobre onde e como os funcionários trabalham.\n\nNascidas do desastre e da necessidade, essas mudanças na maneira como o trabalho é feito deram aos líderes empresariais a chance de jogar fora o antigo manual de emprego. As indústrias de consumo podem - e devem - emergir da pandemia com novos modelos e uma força de trabalho engajada de forma sustentável, inclusiva, diversa e resiliente.\n\nO Grupo de Ação das Indústrias de Consumo (IAG) do Fórum Econômico Mundial tem se esforçado para descobrir a melhor forma de aproveitar esta oportunidade. \n\nUma série de discussões do CEO do IAG começou a articular um caminho ousado à frente, olhando através de três lentes amplas que moldam o emprego: o propósito fundamental do trabalho, onde o trabalho é feito; e como o trabalho é feito, incluindo encontrar e desenvolver funcionários.\n\n1. O propósito fundamental do trabalho\nPropomos que a ideia de ser uma empresa responsável não seja considerada separada do crescimento e do lucro. A nova proposta de valor para os funcionários deve criar um ciclo virtuoso, onde o propósito, estrutural e sistematicamente, impulsiona o desenvolvimento dos funcionários, permite a inclusão e incentiva o desenvolvimento econômico em comunidades carentes.\n\nLink na bio. \n\nFonte: We Fórum\n\n#covid19 #coronavirus #ONN #onovonormal #ONNpoliticapublica #covidart #covid2020, #covid19brasil #covidmask #covidphotodiaries #covidnews #covid19art #corona #coronavírus #coronavirusbrazil #coronaviruspandemic #coronavirusoutbreak #coronavirus2020 #pandemic #pandemicart #pandemic2020, #pandemicorona #pandemiclife","NumberOfLikes":14,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#coronavirus","#ONN","#onovonormal","#ONNpoliticapublica","#covidart","#covid2020,","#covid19brasil","#covidmask","#covidphotodiaries","#covidnews","#covid19art","#corona","#coronavírus","#coronavirusbrazil","#coronaviruspandemic","#coronavirusoutbreak","#coronavirus2020","#pandemic","#pandemicart","#pandemic2020,","#pandemicorona","#pandemiclife"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by O Novo Normal in São Paulo, Brazil.

It\u2019s no secret that being in nature is better for your well-being than living in concrete jungles. Yet, most of us have to choose the latter to survive. So, if we can\u2019t bring ourselves to nature, then why not bring nature to us?\n\n🌸Change the orientation of your furniture since you do not have access to the new environment, this change might help. Often moving a chair, shifting a sofa or re-orienting a bed is enough to give your home a whole new lease on life.\n\nHow are you improving your home vibes?
