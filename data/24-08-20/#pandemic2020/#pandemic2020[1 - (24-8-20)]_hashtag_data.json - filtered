Well shit, things are real shitty right now. \n\nI just moved to a new city with my husband during a pandemic. \nI\u2019m awkward making new friends to begin with. Add in during a time when social circles have become smaller, events aren\u2019t happening, and most things are virtual. \n\nI\u2019ve had this sneaking in feeling of loneliness which I wanted to push away so I\u2019ve kept busy and not let it in. Well that feeling of loneliness crept by last evening and I decided it was okay to mourn the things we have missed out on, my lack of a social life, and to feel sad. So I cried a good cry and had a little scotch. \n\nThe pandemic has made us so disconnected physically and geographically to loved ones and friends. Handshakes and hugs are off limits. We as humans thrive off of human connection. 🤝\n\nSo I guess my post message is it\u2019s okay to feel sad and lonely as long as it doesn\u2019t consume you. Acceptance and processing our emotions is healthy and gives more clarity on what is bothering you and what to do about it. \n\nWell guess I\u2019ll put myself out there to make some friends.

Amidst the current pandemic, this series is relevant as we try to understand what\u2019s happening and look for ways to engage the future. This portrait of Flannery O'Connor, a collector of oddities and visionary, includes symbols of violence she used as a the catalyst for grace, and agents of change -- the bull that gorges and kills, and the fire that both destroys the wood and references the divine. The tattoo man both destructively seeks human connection with the lure of apples, then rejects it. In these uncertain times, I want this series to engage the local community as I explore how nature and a desire for human connection mirror one another, and the part violence and dystopia play to wake us up to reality.\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n#pandemic2020 #pandemicart #flanneryoconnor #flannery #portriatpainting #figurativeart #symbolicart #womenpaintingwomen #womenauthors #texasartist #artspace111 #texasnow #contemporaryrealism #tattooman #viewofthewoods #cleighholderart #artshow #artgallery #originalart #oilpainting #fortworthart #figurativepainting #artcurators #artcollector #poetsartists #southerngothic","NumberOfLikes":46,"Hashtags":["#pandemic2020","#pandemicart","#flanneryoconnor","#flannery","#portriatpainting","#figurativeart","#symbolicart","#womenpaintingwomen","#womenauthors","#texasartist","#artspace111","#texasnow","#contemporaryrealism","#tattooman","#viewofthewoods","#cleighholderart","#artshow","#artgallery","#originalart","#oilpainting","#fortworthart","#figurativepainting","#artcurators","#artcollector","#poetsartists","#southerngothic"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":6,"Timestamp":1598213903,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 22:18:23 CEST 2020","Location":"Artspace111"},{"CaptionText":"The cosmos is within us.

It seemed fitting to revisit today, the presumed 2020 Mont Tremblant Ironman race day, until the pandemic struck. We originally were registered for this year\u2019s  IMMT, then deferred to 2020 Ironman Maryland, which has also been cancelled. Although disappointing, I firmly believe there\u2019s no sense in stressing about things that you can\u2019t control \u2014 Sometimes, that\u2019s easier said than done. This pose is a reminder to myself to continue to reach upward and onward, with hope 💫 towards the future, instead of ruminating about what could have been. I have faith that better days are on the horizon and scientific experts will soon gain control over this virus.

O projeto formará o maior conjunto de grafites do país, com um total de 3.689 metros quadrados pintados. Batizado de \"Festival NaLata\", seria um evento que reuniria muitas outras obras de arte e artistas, mas a pandemia obrigou os organizadores a cancelar grande parte das atividades. \n\n\"Em função da pandemia, o que aconteceu foi que a gente só colocou os artistas que estavam em São Paulo. O festival tinha uma série de atividades para o público que em função da pandemia a gente teve que tirar para evitar aglomeração. Com essas pinturas o festival acontece na rua, é totalmente democrático\", explica Luan Cardoso, curador do festival. \n\nLink na bio. \n\nFonte: Folha Pernambuco\n\n#covid19 #coronavirus #ONN #onovonormal #ONNpoliticapublica #covidart #covid2020, #covid19brasil #covidmask #covidphotodiaries #covidnews #covid19art #corona #coronavírus #coronavirusbrazil #coronaviruspandemic #coronavirusoutbreak #coronavirus2020 #pandemic #pandemicart #pandemic2020, #pandemicorona #pandemiclife #fiqueemcasa #futuro #reuniaoonline #homeoffice #trabalhandoemcasa #emcasa","NumberOfLikes":21,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#coronavirus","#ONN","#onovonormal","#ONNpoliticapublica","#covidart","#covid2020,","#covid19brasil","#covidmask","#covidphotodiaries","#covidnews","#covid19art","#corona","#coronavírus","#coronavirusbrazil","#coronaviruspandemic","#coronavirusoutbreak","#coronavirus2020","#pandemic","#pandemicart","#pandemic2020,","#pandemicorona","#pandemiclife","#fiqueemcasa","#futuro","#reuniaoonline","#homeoffice","#trabalhandoemcasa","#emcasa"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by O Novo Normal in São Paulo, Brazil.

These particles \u201Cshow a more violent climbing tendency. The climbing speed is much faster than toilet flushing,\u201D explained Liu.\n\nSince urinals are more frequently used in densely populated areas, it can pose a serious health challenge.\n\n\u201CWearing a mask should be mandatory within public restrooms during the pandemic, and anti-diffusion improvements are urgently needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19,\u201D Liu added.\n\nEarlier, researchers of fluids at the same university had recommended closing the lid on toilets before flushing to prevent the spread of aerosols. They also recommended washing hands properly with soap after use.\n\n#CoronaVirus #outbreak #publictoilet #toilets #urinal #coronaalert #pandemic2020 #odishabytesnews","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#CoronaVirus","#outbreak","#publictoilet","#toilets","#urinal","#coronaalert","#pandemic2020","#odishabytesnews"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Odisha Bytes in Bhubaneswar, India.

It\u2019s a passion that is a big part of my every day life. \n...\nBack 5 years ago, I was surviving while taking care of and keeping my three kids (baby, 3 & 4 year olds) alive and well. I was totally #burnedout #depressed and #sleepdeprived because I was a mom of thousand trades while hubby was making the dough in South-Korea for 3-5 weeks at a time. \u201CStaying with it\u201D is an overestimation. I was run down. I felt like a train ran over me every single day- yet I kept on surviving. \n...\nI was also healing from a bilateral plantar fasciitis and had 4 months to train for my first #olympicdistancetriathlon ... i only had a mountain bike, didn\u2019t have any idea about swim workouts and could only run 20mins at a time. \n...\nYet I kept dreaming about \u201Cdoing\u201D the triathlon. It gave me a challenge, a purpose, a goal and a dream to reach for all in one. \n..\nWhen the day came, it was a balmy foggy day, +9c with windchill but I didn\u2019t care. I was loving every minute! \n..\nI swam 1500m in about 33mins, biked 44km in 1:37hrs:mins and ran 10k in about 52mins. I took my time in transitions, changing my clothes(!), had an amazing borrowed bike, and had no idea how to pace a 44k. My time was nothing spectacular but I was completely in love. I kept thinking to myself \u201CThis is the most fun I\u2019ve done in years!\u201D. When can I do this again? \n..\n5 years forward and I am still very much in love. My goals have grown from \u201Cdoing\u201D a triathlon to qualifying and racing at Ironman World Championships in Kona. The purpose if the same: to find the physical and mental limits of my body and mind while enjoying the sport and embracing the challenge. \n..\n#covid19 has changed a few things and one of them is that I am now coaching myself (yikes!!). I have huge appreciation for @elementsportscoaching for the last two years and for whipping me into a  immensely more confident and fitter athlete! I feel a bit like a teenager leaving home: a bit scared but confident in my own abilities and super excited for the new adventures ahead! \n...\n#onwardsandupwards despite #pandemic2020 \n...","NumberOfLikes":30,"Hashtags":["#throwbacksaturday","#triahlon","#burnedout","#depressed","#sleepdeprived","#olympicdistancetriathlon","#covid19","#onwardsandupwards","#pandemic2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Marjaana in Rotary Sunshine Park.

What. a. year. As I\u2019ve been preparing for the fall semester, setting new goals and updating my teaching mission statement, I\u2019ve realized how important it is to distinguish between mid-pandemic goals and modified pre-pandemic goals.\n\nMid-Pandemic Goals:\nGoals that focus on what we can do right here, right now. It\u2019s a perspective shift to look at the current circumstances not as the glass being half full or half empty, but just as being, well, a new glass. It\u2019s approaching challenges with a fresh, expectant perspective, looking for new opportunities, new potential, new purpose.\n\nPre-Pandemic Goals:\nThese are the goals we had set when life was \u201Cnormal\u201D. Naturally we try to modify these goals to fit the current circumstances, but pushing and prodding the goals can ultimately result in smaller, less satisfying, and \u201Ctemporary\u201D versions of the original goals. It\u2019s not only an exhausting process, but it sets us up for disappointment and frustration, and what we may deem as failure.\n\nOf course setting aside prior goals is disappointing\u2014being in the middle of a pandemic is full of disappointments\u2014but by choosing to accept the loss and making a deliberate shift to step into a new chapter, we can confidently walk into this semester with a fresh, refined, and deeply rooted sense of purpose\u2014a purpose specifically for teaching music in the midst of a pandemic.\n\n. . . . .\n\nHow has goal setting looked different for you as you start this new semester?\n\nWhat goals have you been disappointed to set aside? What new goals are you excited to pursue?\n\n. . . . .\n\nThis year IS hard. The fears, uncertainties, and challenges we are facing are. really. hard. But thankfully we\u2019re not alone. In hopes of supporting, encouraging, and inspiring each other, I\u2019ll be sharing experiences and words of wisdom from different teachers in the upcoming weeks. So stay tuned.
