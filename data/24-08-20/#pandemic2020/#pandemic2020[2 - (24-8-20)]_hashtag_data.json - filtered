In a pandemic, to survive tough businesses you need razor-sharp thinking. A must-read book for CEOs, entrepreneurs and start-up founders on how to deal with uncertainty. Author Ozan Varol @ozanvarol who served the 2003 Mars Exploration Rovers project, talks about how, \"We're hesitant to think big, reluctant to dance with uncertainty and afraid of failure. These are the bugs.\"\nHere are 7 Secrets of How to Think Like a Rocket Scientist:\nRule 1: Make Doubt your Superpower. Every genius hesitates. We should be fueled not by a desire for a quick catharsis but by intrigue. Where certainty ends, progress begins. Einstein tangoed with uncertainty, conducted imaginative thought experiments and asked questions nobody dared.\nRule 2: Embrace the sense of possibilities, push your limits, explore what is possible.\nRule 3: Question your assumptions. Why you do the things you do. Don't do things that everyone does.\nRule 4: Don't be stuck in systems. They solve problems that don't even exist today.\nRule 5: Create Moonshot goals. Our goals are often safe and cushioned because we fear failure. We have been seduced to thinking flying lower is safer than flying higher.\nRule 6: You must be willing to share your unique ideas with the world, don't be repressed by conformity.\nRule 7: Don't Rulebound Yourself. Ozan writes, \"Research shows we become increasingly rulebound as we grow older. Events begin to rhyme. Days begin to repeat. We repeat the same overworn soundbites, stick to the same job, talk to the same people, watch the same shows. It's choose-your-own-adventure book that always has same ending. Our processes are developed in response to yesterday's troubles, if you don't question it  will impede forward movement.\"\n.\nThink Like A Rocket Scientist is published by Penguin Random House\n#books #book #pandemic #2020 #bookstagram #bookstagrammer #booklover #bookaddict #booknerd #bookreview #booksofinstagram #bookworm #bookgram #booklovers #selfhelp #rules #life #work #think #mind #instamood #insta #newnormal #pandemic2020 #instagood","NumberOfLikes":9,"Hashtags":["#1","#books","#book","#pandemic","#2020","#bookstagram","#bookstagrammer","#booklover","#bookaddict","#booknerd","#bookreview","#booksofinstagram","#bookworm","#bookgram","#booklovers","#selfhelp","#rules","#life","#work","#think","#mind","#instamood","#insta","#newnormal","#pandemic2020","#instagood"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Nona Walia on August 20, 2020 tagging @penguinrandomhouse.

Try to limit screen time at night.\n\n🔹Follow 20-20-20 rule: For every 20 minutes spent using a screen, you should try to look away at something that is 20 feet away from you for a total of 20 seconds.\n\n🔹Nourish them with right nutrition: All the above tips will work only if you eat foods that help in better vision which includes: \n\n🌽🥕🥬Green leafy, yellow, red and orange color fruits and vegetables which are rich in beta carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin\n\n🍓🍊Berries and Citrus fruits which are packed with vit C\n\n🥜Nuts like almonds which will provide zinc and vit E\n\n🍣Salmon and other fatty fishes for Omega -3 fatty acids \n\nMost of the mentioned nutrients like vit A, vit C,  vit E act as antioxidants.

Quite frankly I remember being so pissed off at myself that I cried. 🙄 \n.\nPersonally I wasn\u2019t angry at the things I spent the money on. I was a full time premed student working 40-50 hours a week, doing research, volunteering, all the things they tell you to do. It was HARD. I remember using those credit cards for groceries, books, Walmart stuff, gas, the occasional Starbucks, etc. I remember being stretched to my absolute limit of problems I could handle at one time. 😰Because I was young and didn\u2019t know better I stuck my head in the sand and told myself \u201Cjust survive, you\u2019ll figure it out later.\u201D 😓\n. \nWhen I calculated my debt in 2018 and cried in frustration it was because I chose to be in denial back in college. I was not equipped to handle and did not prioritize money the way I should have. Sadly, despite these failures I was still way better off than most of my friends. I saw some really horrible decisions being made but they too had the mentality of \u201Cjust survive, you\u2019ll figure it out later.\u201D 😞\n.\nThat\u2019s sad. That is SO sad to me that we all felt so overwhelmed just trying to get a good education. I honestly think college was the most difficult period of my life for many reasons but finances was a big one.\n.\nSo please...from me to you...don\u2019t beat yourself up anymore than you already have. Your intentions were good. You did what you thought you could. 🤗\n.\nLife goes on and now you\u2019re here. ❤️ You\u2019re smarter, stronger, and ready to tackle the things you neglected.

She is on the spectrum, is highly sensory seeking, and suffers from adhd. She has taught me so much.\n\nI struggle most days to deal with her moods, behaviors, and idiosyncrasies . . . and then she bares her heart with her sweet moments, like when she sporadically decides it's a \"taking care of mommy\" night. Or her creative moments like the times when she is creating mini meals or full on birthday parties for her LOL dolls. I also adore the amazing bond she has with her sister.\n\nBut homeschooling this girl is hard, y'all. I am not patient and like all of you who are trying this, I worry that her needs will not be met. Some days it's hard to get her to do the work at all. But then there are the days like yesterday when she stayed focused on two pages worth of handwriting practice. It's in those moments that I feel like we're going to be okay.\n\nI also find that my child thrives in nature, so if you would like to learn how to use nature in your homeschooling, check out my latest blog post, which can be found in a link in my bio. Or, if you need general help with homeschooling your special needs child, I have a post filled with resources on that, too.\n\nWe can do hard things with trial and error, folks. And I do believe our efforts are building stronger bonds with our kids. \n\nI would love to hear about how you are incorporating nature into your homeschooling, or homeschooling your special needs child in a way that works better for you.","NumberOfLikes":39,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Toxin-free Living for Moms on August 20, 2020.

Meski pada praktiknya tetap saja tidak dapat dilakukan sesuai harapan. Warga masih butuh keluar dari rumah untuk melakukan rutinitasnya. Apalagi rutinitas yang menyangkut perekonomian rumah tangga, sulit sekali untuk dihentikan dan dialihkan pada hal lain. Tidak semua profesi dapat melakukan sistem WFH (Work From Home), sehingga menimbulkan kecemasan dan ketakutan pada kalangan tertentu.\n\nBukan hanya mengancam kesehatan fisik, Covid-19 juga serius mengancam kesehatan mental. Sebagai profesi yang menerapkan sistem WFH, guru yang harus melakukan pembelajaran daring tidak terkecuali mendapat ancaman stress yang cukup besar. Tuntutan yang banyak, sistem-sistem baru, dan media pembelajaran yang masih asing menuntut untuk dipelajari dalam waktu yang singkat, membuat guru kelelahan bukan hanya dalam hal fisik, tetapi juga psikis. Beban mengajar menjadi dua kali lipat karena membutuhkan kreativitas dan keterampilan-keterampilan baru.\n\nBukan hanya siswa yang kesulitan beradaptasi dengan sistem pendidikan baru ini, terlebih guru yang harus mempersiapkan dan mempelajari banyak hal secara tiba-tiba. Dibutuhkan perjuangan dan mental yang sehat untuk terus menjalani sistem baru ini.\n\n#kesehatanmental #mentalguru #kesehatanjiwa #kesejahteraanguru #guruindonesia #indonesiamengajar #gurumengajar #gurupengajar #pembelajaranonline #pandemic2020 #semangatguru #semangatpendidik #pendidikindonesia #guruagenperubahanindonesia #menjagakesehatan #menjagakesehatantubuh #pendidikanindonesialebihbaik #pendidikanindonesia","NumberOfLikes":31,"Hashtags":["#kesehatanmental","#mentalguru","#kesehatanjiwa","#kesejahteraanguru","#guruindonesia","#indonesiamengajar","#gurumengajar","#gurupengajar","#pembelajaranonline","#pandemic2020","#semangatguru","#semangatpendidik","#pendidikindonesia","#guruagenperubahanindonesia","#menjagakesehatan","#menjagakesehatantubuh","#pendidikanindonesialebihbaik","#pendidikanindonesia"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597925615,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 20 14:13:35 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"adizzle_c","CaptionText":"About once a month I make an appearance in actual work clothes 🖇️🚦🛣️🚲🚶\u200D♀️\n\n#essential #workworkwork #transportationplanner #urbanplanner #pandemic2020 #officeappearance","NumberOfLikes":44,"Hashtags":["#essential","#workworkwork","#transportationplanner","#urbanplanner","#pandemic2020","#officeappearance"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Amanda C. in Tampa, Florida.

This year, we traveled here with the tools of our (pandemic) trade: 5 string instruments and 1 violin in-progress, 2 laptops, a tripod, multiple sets of headphones and earbuds, and all the hand tools a violin maker needs to put the finishing touches on several new instruments. We didn\u2019t forget to print out the negative Covid tests.\n\nTonight, after teaching private lessons, I was on a 2.5 hour Zoom call playing cello and talking about chamber music. At the end we watched a virtual presentation of final recorded projects from the last four weeks of music-making: students, faculty, and admin all came together, almost constantly in correspondence over the past month, to make these projects happen. \n\nIt was not easy, but it was rewarding - to see the final videos, and the happy and proud faces (\u201Call the little faces in squares\u201D) on the screen. Perfection was not the goal, but collaborative music-making was achieved, in spite of the distance. \n\nMaybe now is a good time to sit back and enjoy the sunset.

In this case, things are scary, unknown, frustrating, sad etc etc etc. But despite everything going on around the world, within my own home, I have found peace. I found the opportunity to create, fix, relax, enjoy etc etc etc. I don't feel quite as spread thin with a packed schedule.

I have enjoyed riding my bike with the kids and going to the beach (we take living in Hawaii for granted sometimes) I appreciate the extra help around the house that the littles didn't have time for before with hula, baseball, church, school.

According to the CDC, face masks are recommended as a simple barrier to help prevent respiratory droplets from traveling into the air and onto other people when the person wearing the mask coughs, sneezes, talks, or raises their voice. This is called source control. This recommendation is based on what we know about the role respiratory droplets play in the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19, paired with emerging evidence from clinical and laboratory studies that shows masks reduce the spray of droplets when worn over the nose and mouth. COVID-19 spreads mainly among people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet), so the use of masks is particularly important in settings where people are close to each other or where social distancing is difficult to maintain. However, many people still have doubts about the actual efficacy of wearing masks in the fight against COVID-19. Most who doubt are individual citizens, some are from the medical field and some are from the viral research field. They have their reasons, of which some of the often-mentioned ones will be discussed here.\n\nSee more : www.icloudhospital.com\n\n#wearamask #wearmaskornot #covid19 #corona #coronovirus #pandemic #pandemic2020 #virus #health #healthcare #cloudhospital","NumberOfLikes":6,"Hashtags":["#wearamask","#wearmaskornot","#covid19","#corona","#coronovirus","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#virus","#health","#healthcare","#cloudhospital"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by CloudHospital on August 19, 2020.

I\u2019ve been put through the motha fuckin RINGER and if I didn\u2019t have this mentality I totally would have crumbled by now. I\u2019ve been thinking about this quote a lot the last few days. If you watch my stories than you know that I am in a terrible situation when it comes to housing right now. Due to the pandemic we have to move like immediately, we didn\u2019t get approved for the loan to buy the house since the landlord wants to sell, and the rental market is terrible. I had a mini breakdown yesterday. I started thinking about how I ALWAYS do everything by the book and things just don\u2019t work out for me. When you are trying to break cycles of poverty, addiction, homelessness, it\u2019s not as easy as \u201Cwork hard and you will succeed\u201D. I\u2019ve spent my entire life working as hard as I can, getting all straight a\u2019s, working multiple jobs, and still I always fall short because of something from my past. Both of my parents have passed away, so I don\u2019t have anyone to help me co-sign for loans, or lend me a few dollars if I need it, or teach me how to build credit or apply for a mortgage. My mom let her addiction get the best of her and she started me off with terrible credit when I turned 18 by using my SSN to sign up for cards, gas and electric.. the list goes on. I\u2019ve been trying to work off the disadvantages growing up in extreme poverty with addict parents my entire life.. and it\u2019s fucking hard. My life has been full of struggles, unbelievable stories, things you only see in the movies.. and I could have let it ruin me. But I just let it fuel my fire. Some days I just want to throw in the towel, but then I think about what I\u2019ve already been able to survive. You can get through ANYTHING with hope. It\u2019s not as easy as \u201Cworking hard\u201D, and it won\u2019t always be a straight path, but if you never give up on yourself, I promise you it will just make you more and more unbreakable every single time.

By only requiring the use of mostly basic props and furniture, we have tried to make the poses as accessible as possible for everyone.\n\nThe programme was compiled thanks to advice and guidance from Abhijata Iyengar, Lois Steinberg, Gulnaaz Dashti, Stephanie Quirk, the IY(UK) Therapy Committee, IY(UK) teachers who have experienced the virus themselves, and decades of work by BKS Iyengar and Dr Geeta S. Iyengar in medical classes at RIMYI in Pune.\n\nSee the link in our bio to access the video and booklet, which are both freely available. Please consider donating a contribution towards this and future Iyengar yoga therapy resources 🙏\n\nThanks to all involved in creating the programme and to @adrienne_karmaspaceyoga for designing the e-book\n\n#iyengaryoga #yogatherapy #covid19 #covid_19 #coronavirus #recovery #covidhelp #yogaforhealing #yoga #mypandemicsurvivalplan #sarscov2 #pandemic #pandemic2020 #staysafe #virus #postcovid #yogapractice #loveyoga #yogateachers  #iyengarmethod #yogadaily #practiceyoga #yogisofinstagram #yogajourney","NumberOfLikes":11,"Hashtags":["#Repost","#iyengaryoga","#yogatherapy","#covid19","#covid_19","#coronavirus","#recovery","#covidhelp","#yogaforhealing","#yoga","#mypandemicsurvivalplan","#sarscov2","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#staysafe","#virus","#postcovid","#yogapractice","#loveyoga","#yogateachers","#iyengarmethod","#yogadaily","#practiceyoga","#yogisofinstagram","#yogajourney"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Vanessa Oviedo on August 19, 2020.

It\u2019s no secret that being in nature is better for your well-being than living in concrete jungles. Yet, most of us have to choose the latter to survive. So, if we can\u2019t bring ourselves to nature, then why not bring nature to us?\n\n🌸Change the orientation of your furniture since you do not have access to the new environment, this change might help. Often moving a chair, shifting a sofa or re-orienting a bed is enough to give your home a whole new lease on life.\n\nHow are you improving your home vibes?

As the story goes, the barracks used to give dances or something like that. Then in comes my mom \u2014 beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. His face lit up when he saw her. \n\nWhen the war ended, my dad came back to Chicago. My grandma, his mother, owned a lot of property on the South Side. So my Dad sent for my mom and they came and lived in an apartment in my grandma\u2019s building. They bought their first home in 1955 in Englewood.\n\nMy mother was the type of woman \u2014 she didn\u2019t wait for my father to bring home the paycheck. My mother said, \u2018Wait one minute. If something happens to your dad, then what will I do? I\u2019m going to get out there and work too.\u2019 \n\nShe was a great wife. My father might have been the man of the house but my mother was the boss. And she taught my sister and I what it meant to be a woman \u2014 not just a woman, but a Black woman. To stand on your own two feet, to make your life worth something. To not depend on someone else to do for you when you can get out to do for yourself. \n\nThis is the type of mother I had.\u201D\n\nWBEZ\u2019s @nueli photographed Josette Merill, whose mother, Lillie Merrill, died of COVID-19 in April at the age of 98.

So if your Four Walls aren\u2019t in the right place then that\u2019s your first step.\n.\n🚨If your Four Walls are fine then I would look next at anything you have in collections. Bringing your payments current is going to be your priority. \n. \n❄️If your walls are fine and your payments are current then you get to decide if you prefer the avalanche or the snowball method of paying off debt! Briefly stated, the avalanche method means you prioritize paying off the one debt with the highest interest rate while continuing to make minimum payments on everything else. The snowball method means you pay the smallest debt first and then snowball the payment you were making to that debt and add that payment amount to your next debt you choose to tackle. \n.\n🏔The avalanche method typically saves you more money in the long term because you pay less in interest by tackling the highest interest items first. Some people though prefer the snowball method because there is more of a sense of progress because you see the debts disappear off your list one by one. \n. \n⛄️That said...I personally am a snowball person. For me I like how motivated I am by smashing out one debt at a time. Ultimately, if you choose avalanche but then you\u2019re not motivated and you fall off the wagon then it\u2019s not better than snowball at all. 🤷🏻\u200D♀️ So whichever works for you and keeps you motivated and on track is the right one. \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~","NumberOfLikes":7,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Emerald, PA-S on August 19, 2020.

That was tough leaving a 6 weeks baby at home and go back straight to work. Now, I\u2019m getting the chance to see Jon-Jon grow in front of my eyes, and I feel so grateful for every min I spend with him 🙏🙏.\n🌟I got a chance to change my lifestyle - do more exercises and lose all the weight I gained from pregnancy (I couldn\u2019t stop eating) 🥗🏃\u200D♀️. \n🌟I feel much more relaxed and much peaceful. Anyone who sees me these days will notice the difference (thanks to the Pilates) 🧘\u200D♀️. \n🌟I got the chance to spend much much more time with hubby and strengthen our family unit. Believe me this time is so precious 👨\u200D👩\u200D👦. \n🌟And last but not least, I learned to wake up every morning and say Thank You for everything I have in life. I learned that life is so short, and you must take an advantage of every min and make it counts 💞💞.\n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s only me who took so much from this period at home, but I definitely thankful for this time.

Most people infected will experience a mild to moderate respiratory illness, whilst others will show no symptoms at all. However for some the effects are severe and longer lasting.\n\nTheir aim in this yoga programme is to play some role in aiding the process of recovery. By only requiring the use of mostly basic props and furniture, they have tried to make the poses as accessible as possible for everyone.\n\nThe programme was compiled thanks to advice and guidance from Abhijata Iyengar, Lois Steinberg, Gulnaaz Dashti, Stephanie Quirk, the IY(UK) Therapy Committee, IY(UK) teachers who have experienced the virus themselves, and decades of work by BKS Iyengar and Dr Geeta S.

The trials of Covishield vaccine will involve 1,600 people above the age of 18 years across 17 locations in Pune, Mumbai and Ahmedabad. Out of the 1600 test subjects, 400 will be tested for immune response whereas 1200 will be tested to understand the safety of the vaccine. This is by far the largest COVID-19 vaccine trial in the country. \n\nReports also indicate that in Mumbai, the trials are being conducted at KEM and Nair hospitals. They have already started the preliminary procedures for the study. The medical institution will be conducting trials on 320 volunteers between the age group of 20 and 50 years. In total, the trial has around 1000 to 1,100 participants enrolled across five to eight locations. \n\nThe vaccine has already undergone Phase I and II trials in the UK where it showed positive results. Preliminary trials revealed that the vaccine induces an antibody response in just 28 days -- similar to the patients who have recovered from COVID-19. A second booster shot of the vaccine spikes antibody response at an even higher level. All the blood samples of patients with a second booster shot revealed neutralising activity. \n\n📸REUTERS\n#oxford #oxfordvaccine #seruminstituteofindia #vaccinecoronadanger #oxfordvaccineprice #seruminstitute #vaccine #instagood #instadaily #instagram #pandemic2020 #akhiltalks #AkhilTalks #reuters #recent4recent #recentupdates","NumberOfLikes":55,"Hashtags":["#oxford","#oxfordvaccine","#seruminstituteofindia","#vaccinecoronadanger","#oxfordvaccineprice","#seruminstitute","#vaccine","#instagood","#instadaily","#instagram","#pandemic2020","#akhiltalks","#AkhilTalks","#reuters","#recent4recent","#recentupdates"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Akhil Talks on August 19, 2020.

If you can go to some green space, even better. Or just go outside, watch the sky for 10 minutes, and put your bare feet on the earth.
