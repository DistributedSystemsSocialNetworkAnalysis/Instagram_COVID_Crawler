Let me explain the picture on this post. For the moment I live in South Korea (no Im not Korean) , this picture was taken at my local gym on August 19th. On the left side of the pic we have a column that depicts a person that is infected with Covid-19. On the right side we have a peson that is not infected with Covid-19. Now according to this propaganda piece of laminated paper, if you and the infected person are wearing a mask the possibility of infection is 1.5%. If the infected and the none infected are not wearing a mask then the possibility of infection is 100%. Now I dont know if any of you remember this but around 5 months ago the WHO was against wearing a mask and even said that wearing a mask doesn't protect you from the virus. They were right but as soon as Trump dropped financial aid support for the WHO , they sided with communist China and changed their mindset regarding the mask. The mask doesn't protect you from shit, that is the point of this posting. It only slowly poisons your lungs by breathing your own C02. The mask is only a symbol of communist compliance to the government, that is the only purpose for it. \n\nNow for my fellow Koreans, please wake up! Stop believing the mainstream news, stop watching your apps about infected people, those numbers are fake most of the time. Even if you die from a heart attack some hospitals are labeling the cause of death as Covid-19 in order to get funding. Stop trusting your government, they are best friends with communist China and have no interest in fixing this situation at all other than continuing on inposing this stupid rules. Yeah Korea is safe from the chaos in the West, but nothing last forever and soon Korea will fall into civil unrest...people can only take so much before they explode and decide that enough is fucking enough!! The mask is a symbol of communism plain and simple. That is all.\n\n#control #covid19sucks #billgatescoronavirus #billgates #drfauci #drfauciisafraud #pandemic2020 #covid_19 #fake #bullshit #hiddenagenda #science #commonsense #stop #mask #fuckmask #lies #2020corruption #hydroxychloroquine #doctorsfortruth #cure #vaccine #endtimes #Zionist","NumberOfLikes":12,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The Collector ☠ in Seoul, Korea.

I really feel I\u2019m getting back in to my running groove again, now the weather\u2019s a little cooler, and this is making me happy!\n\nI was reflecting this morning on the uncertainty of our current situation. As a nation we have been suddenly thrown in to lockdown, then started to ease out of it, some of us have been thrown back in to it, while others of us have watched from the sidelines wondering if we will be next.\n\nIt makes it very difficult to plan for the future. Not knowing what the future will be like, or when the new normal will start. Or has it started already?\n\nHowever, what I do know is we can try to gain some control by planing and planing  and more planing. Trying to predict all eventualities. Yet, until we are in the situation, we don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to turn out.\n\nOften the things we worry about the most turn out to be fine in the end, and the things we don\u2019t think about turn out to be much bigger problems. Even without a pandemic life is full of uncertainty, and anxious planning for all eventualities can\u2019t stop that.\n\nWe are all doing the best we can, with the information we have at the time, and that is all we can do right now. So be kind to yourself. Hindsight is a wonderful thing, but sadly we don\u2019t have it until after the event.\n\n#running #motherrunner #runningformentalhealth #maternalmentalhealth #thismumruns #runner #badassmotherrunner #womensrunning #womensrunningcommunity #halfmarathontraining #mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #psychology #run #runnersofinstagram #runhappy #runtoinspire #therapistsofinstagram #motherhoodunplugged #anxiety #mentalwellbeing #mentalhealthinfluencer #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":120,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Chloe on August 18, 2020.

There are plenty of hurdles before any new invention can hit the market, but the team seems quite gung-ho about their prospects.\n\n#masks #facemasks #covid #covid19awareness #nanomaterial #sarscov2 #sars #covid19 #N95masks #microorganisms #virus #pandemic2020 #epidemic #pharmacist #pharmafacts #factspharma #factsonly #didyouknowfact #pharmfacts","NumberOfLikes":13,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by PharmaClass on August 18, 2020.

However for some the effects are severe and longer lasting.\n\nOur aim in this yoga programme is to play some role in aiding the process of recovery. By only requiring the use of mostly basic props and furniture, we have tried to make the poses as accessible as possible for everyone.\n\nThe programme was compiled thanks to advice and guidance from Abhijata Iyengar, Lois Steinberg, Gulnaaz Dashti, Stephanie Quirk, the IY(UK) Therapy Committee, IY(UK) teachers who have experienced the virus themselves, and decades of work by BKS Iyengar and Dr Geeta S.

The trail meanders through woods and around two small lakes which were teeming with turtles and birds. Great egrets were in abundance. The most interesting aspect of the park is the Doll's Head Trail which is an outdoor gallery of sorts. The art is created from the trash that has been found in the park after the South River floods. Doll's heads are incorporated into many of the installations which resemble the work of Howard Finster. I found the doll's heads creepy, especially during this pandemic which is why I avoided sharing those with you.

Health experts say two days or less is optimal for returning test results to make them useful for stopping transmission. If test results take more than three days, people are unlikely to self-quarantine and getting in touch with the people they interact with during that time, potentially spreading the virus, can be difficult. \u2060\n\u2060\nThe survey results varied state by state. Some, like Massachusetts and South Dakota, had average turnaround times of just over two days. Others, like Arizona and West Virginia, were closer to four and a half days, on average.

Only when we know that we are our own ultimate bottom line can we not overburden relationships with impossible expectations. What do you think about when you are told you are your own primary? What do you feel in your body?  #relationships #relationshiptherapy #couples #couplestherapy #happilyeverafter #pandemic #pandemic2020 #intimacy #intimacyconsultant #sextherapy #sextherapist #mindfulness #mindfulrelationships #love #partnership #consciousmonogamy #polyamory #ethicalnonmonogamy #singlebychoice #aromantic #compassion #embodiment #communication #partnership #marriage #divorce #desire #values #expectations #psychotherapy","NumberOfLikes":261,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":11,"Timestamp":1597719440,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 18 04:57:20 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"🌻🕶\n-\n-\n-\n-#endorsement #ootdinspiration #ootdstyle #ootdhijab #selebgramhits #potokekinian📷📹🎥 #pandemic2020 #hitskekinian","NumberOfLikes":102,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":31,"Timestamp":1597718953,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 18 04:49:13 CEST 2020","Location":"Endorsement"},{"CaptionText":"धोनी जैसा न कोई था न कोई होगा आज जहां भारतीय टीम है उसमें सबसे बड़ा योगदान महेंद्र सिंह धोनी का है.\nआपकी शालीनता और संयम आने वाले खिलाड़ियों को सिखाना चाहिए। #msdhonifc #dhoniretirment #quarantine #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":4,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by psd media in Delhi, India.

This year has taken the world by storm, fire and water quite literally. Some things aren\u2019t within our control and that\u2019s really mostly all of 2020.\n.\nHowever, there is so much that we still are capable of and that is where I believe we underestimate ourselves. To be part of the world that struggles and yet revives, to stand up a little stronger, cling on to hope a little tighter and hold on to faith a little deeper. To go all out and donate generously, empathise passionately and help fervently. To believe there is one overlooking all of this despair and absolutely nothing happens without his knowledge. That no matter how bad it gets, you will get through this , for no soul shall be burdened more than he can bear.\n.\nLook at the glorious skies and enwrap yourself with the beauty of this world. Soak yourself in the warmth of the horizon for it does leave you with a sense of gratitude, hope and faith.\nWhile we wake up each day to something that breaks our heart yet again, know that there are also stories of joy and happiness witnessing that very moment. And for every heartbreak, we have a little something we can offer to the world. And that, we must.\nWith time, the broken too shall heal.\nThe world shall heal.\nYou shall heal.\nIn sha Allah♥️\n..\n#musingsofahijabi #holdontohope #roadtorecovery #ayeartoremember #prayforbeirut #prayfortheworld #gratefulthankfulblessed #pandemic2020 #uaebloggers #writersofinstagram #dubaiblogger #hijabibloggers #momsofinstagram #momsofdubai #dubaimoms #dubaimums #kitebeachdubai #horizonviews #2020pleasebekind #momsofdubai #writersofdubai #fortheloveofwriting","NumberOfLikes":207,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by 𝓐𝓶𝓻𝓮𝓮𝓷 in Kite Beach Dubai.

Third grade is looking a lot different than I ever had imagined. I\u2019m very anxious I\u2019m not going to lie. I had to set up a space for the girls with my old office desk so that they could have a separate space designated for school. They are to check in every morning via zoom at 8am and then receive assignments daily. They will then have 2 other zoom meetings throughout the day. There will be snack break and lunch break but there isn\u2019t a hall pass needed to use the restroom. They won\u2019t be running to meet their friends for recess and any questions they have on their school work will be directed to their mommy. \n.\nThe pressure and anxiety that is helping my girls learn is a lot. My girls are in a dual language program, meaning 80% of their day is in Spanish. Yes I speak it, they speak it and we are all 100% fluent.  But can I teach in Spanish? Can I answer math and science and writing comprehension questions in Spanish? We will have to see. Yes we did this from March to June but it was different. The teacher knew the kids by then. She knew how to group them, what to assign to them based on their abilities and well to be honest we all thought it was over with in June.\n.\nBut this is third grade. It\u2019s a new school year, a new teacher and a much higher expectation. They are expected to sit and learn from 8-2, they are expected to not get distracted at home and learn a brand new curriculum. My heart aches for them. They said the only thing they wish for is for school to open again. 😭 \n.\nBut here we are. Doing the best we can. It seems like nothing else matters right now because of how overwhelmed I feel but I know there are so many others in this same boat. So remember to be kind to each other, to lean on anyone that can help and to not judge each other because this is all such a difficult time for so many of us! Good luck to all the kiddos and teachers starting school from afar.

Not that every single day is crappy. I\u2019ve had a lot of good days! But the mental exhaustion is really, well, exhausting. The pandemic has definitely played into this and I think that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been most in denial about. I started off this \u201C15 days to slow the spread\u201D so positively. But who knew that these efforts against the \u2018rona would last for 5+ months?? I don\u2019t think any of us could\u2019ve been prepared for that. I look back over the majority of Max\u2019s life and think, \u201CHow the heck did we get here?\u201D with regards to the shutdowns and this virus. I\u2019m so over it!

I know online classes can be challenging for some, but now is the time to put your practice into action. Don\u2019t let your mind get in the way of consistent practice & focus on all the reasons that in person classes are better. This internal practice allows us to observe our own mind, ego, thoughts and desires. I may have a desire to be doing yoga in public groups, but I know I\u2019m causing less harm by practicing\/teaching online. The conditions do not need to be \u201Cjust right\u201D for me to go inward, observe, reflect, contemplate & refine the way that I move, speak, think & act in this world. In fact, they usually are not & this is part of the practice. I don\u2019t need a ocean view, large group, or killer playlist (all very nice) to practice. Yoga teaches us not to be attached to the way things were or to how we want them to be. How can I be happy or content if I\u2019m always wishing things were different from what they are? Consistent practice gives us the wisdom & resiliency to accept & adapt to circumstances outside of our control, & the strength to act on circumstances within our control. We are fortunate to have the guidance of our yoga teachers who are busting their ass to recreate a \u201Cstudio\u201D experience & keep everyone connected & inspired, even though we are apart.

If this pandemic has taught us anything, it is to really sit back and assess our lives, our health, our lifestyles, and what the world we want to live in looks like.\n\nHere\u2019s what else I know - President of the World 2020, last name Law, first name Murphy, reallllly f***ed us. \n\nSo what do we do? Pivot, adapt, respond to change.\n\nHere\u2019s how we did that, our isolated summer at a glance\n\n🥕 we built 2 huge gardens (with great friends) growing more produce than we can eat\n🌾 started a medicinal plant garden\n🎥 2! Count em 2 documentaries were filmed about our journey (coming soon)\n🌱 began a Permaculture course to learn how to serve our land, as well as build knowledge for my sustainable living business, specifically how to retrofit urban dwellings to be more sustainable\n✊🏼 dove deep into environmental activism, allying with anti racism initiatives and gas phase out plans locally\n🌿 help build a great community of sustainable businesses + a resource hub @ecohamilton \n👨\u200D👩\u200D👧\u200D👦👨\u200D👩\u200D👦 bubbled with friends (this saved our, and our sons, mental health)\n🐓 adopted some egg layers!\n🌲 took Bo on his first wilderness trip\n😬 spent a decent amount of time anxious about the world\n🌿spent even more time building ideas on how to fix it\n\nThere is likely a lot I am missing, but guys, this summer was \/ is crazy hard, we\u2019ve filled it with so many purposeful things and I\u2019m proud of us, September is going to be scary, my toddler goes back to school and my husband is a teacher, what we have working is he works at an outdoor school so 🙌🏼 \n\nBut still, wow, does anyone feel whiplashed by 2020 so far?\n\nI\u2019ve been gone so long, what have you been up to!?

On the beach. In the Caribbean 😢. Regardless, I\u2019m still happy. Even though all our classes are online, I\u2019ll still be in Atlanta and I\u2019m ready for what this journey has to bring.\n\nDr. Eze in the making!\npic @b.a.eze\n\nSide note: I didn\u2019t have time to get a professional picture done but oh well. Oh, to all my friends, CHECK ON ME! When you see me on the street, ACT LIKE YOU DO KNOW ME!

Since March: \u2063\n\u2063\u2063\n😷 Everyone, including all of the students, wear masks.\u2063\n🧼 Constant hand washing. \u2063\u2063\n❌They have a strict no visitor policy. Not even parents! \u2063\n✅The classroom sizes are limited to a max of 10 people\u2063\n🚫There is no intermingling between classes.\u2063\u2063\n👩\u200D💻 They offer virtual learning as well so the overall in-person enrollment is significantly reduced. \u2063\u2063\n🛑There is no use of the indoor gym or play areas (only outdoor playgrounds.) \u2063\u2063\n🧽 Sanitizing of each classroom at the end of each day. \u2063\u2063\n🚗 Drop off is via carline only and parents are asked to wear masks as well.\u2063\u2063\n🌡 There is a thorough screening procedure at drop off including temp checks and screening questions.\u2063\u2063\n🤧 If you answer yes to any of the questions, you will be asked to keep your child home.\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nI realize that this school is private so possibly better equipped to handle this but I think seeing what a great job they have done can at least give us hope and bring back a little normalcy into our lives.\u2063 \n\u2063\u2063\nThis in no way means that I do not take this pandemic seriously nor did I make this decision lightly.

I am proud of my father who is continually serving his patients amidst the very high risk this pandemic. He has asthma and a senior citizen but his call of duty is very important to him. He has put himself in isolation twice to protect us because he was exposed to covid positive people. I admire him for his dedication and great service despite the lack of support from the government. I applaud my mother @marian0101 for being so strong and enduring during this time of pandemic. She is doing everything she can to make sure that our family is safe and healthy. She lost her brother because of covid. She never stops taking care of us. I commend my sister, @pamquebral for being so strong in her pregnancy during this pandemic. She is gracefully handling all the struggles of being pregnant during this time. I can only imagine all her fears and worries for her childbirth. I would also like to praise my 2 friends @loryipsum for giving up her career in the corporate world and leaving Manila to take care of her father back in their hometown & @yansrandomness for taking the risk of being independent and standing on her own without family support and who is also celebrating her birthday. Kudos to my aunt @marita28 for being an awesome mom to my cousins and my mom's confidant. Lastly, to my husband, @lllllllllloydster who is an essential worker who works hard to provide for our family and my ube obsessed one year old baby, Mary munchkin who eats all kinds of ube and ube flavored food from biscuits, bread and cake.

The earlier you deal with it, the easier it\u2019ll be overcome it.\n.\nStill, don\u2019t neglect to search for professional assistance if necessary.

A three-judge bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra said that 'life has to go on' despite Covid and the court cannot put career of students in peril by interfering with the decision of the National Testing Agency.'Career of students cannot be put in peril. We find no merit in the petition. The petition is dismissed', the bench which also comprised justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari said.'You (lawyers) have demanded opening of physical courts.But you want exams to be postponed. Postponment of exams is a loss for country,' the bench said.Petitioner's lawyer Alakh Alok Srivastava said that vaccine for Covid is 'on its way' and he is not seeking an indefinite postponment of the exams. But the bench found no merit in the case.Another petition praying that NEET and JEE should be held as per schedule, was withdrawn by the petitioner after the court rejected the plea seeking postponement.Earlier this month, a plea was filed before the Supreme Court by 11 students belonging to 11 states seeking the postponement of JEE and NEET 2020 exams till the situation due to the covid-19 pandemic normalizes. The plea sought quashing of National Testing Agency's (NTA) July 3 notice, to hold of JEE and NEET entrance examination in September.As per the public notices notified by the NTA, JEE (Main) 2020 exam is scheduled to be held from September 1-6, while the NEET-UG 2020 exam is scheduled for September 13.\nConducting JEE and NEET at this stage will put lives of lakhs of young students in danger, the petition filed by 11 JEE\/NEET aspirants said. 'The best recourse at this stage can be to wait for some more time, let Covid-19 Crisis subside and then only conduct these Exams, in order to save the lives of the students and their parents,' the petition said.\nEarlier, JEE mains was scheduled to be conducted in April and May respectively, which was later postponed due to the Covid-19 disease outbreak.\n#jee #neet #exam #education\n#supremecourt #rejection\n#petition #ntaneet\n#covid19 #pandemic2020\n#exam2020  #students #ugc","NumberOfLikes":7,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @connecting_dots1947 on August 17, 2020.

We have managed to squeeze a classroom into our home with the help of all of you.  As you know we spent a hot summer day suffocating in our masks only to find a bare warehouse at IKEA.  Not one desk left.  So I left with 12 plastic beach shovels with no beach in site.  We did finally  manage to find a talented artist on Facebook that handcrafted 4 beautiful matching  desks that I pray none of you carve before the weeks end. \nWe are going to do things a-little different this year. I\u2019m really pushing leadership skills & a strong science curriculum ( that\u2019s why you have a duo scope ) \nTherefore when one of you learns a concept your ability to teach it to your sibling classmates will be your test to move forward.  Making sure that your 4th 5th & 8th grade fellow students understand it clears the path for you to move onto your next assignment.  You may find yourself moving up or down in levels but that\u2019s ok.  Your grades are counting on this. \nMy main focus as the administrator  will be  Pre School thru first grade.  I\u2019ve managed to find a program that guarantees reading in 30 days or a money back guarantee.  Same with writing.  I purchased 5 different programs through Instagram so we are bound to have a 1st grade reader and writer  by October 1st.  If not we use that refund to buy Xbox live cards for the top student leaders and add a 1st grader to the concept learning.  It\u2019s going to take patience & a smidgeon more time but think of all the gaming you\u2019ll be able to do on a school night when she rattles her first sight words ...bacteria... germs...viral load.... contamination. \nI promise you there is no school or district that can maintain the level of safety care & education that Rona has  forced me to  provide but because we are considered a micro school by size continuing  social distancing will be required  throughout the school year so please keep that in mind.  Studies show 6 feet is not enough so double that please. Im available through email  a text but if it\u2019s an  immediate concern message me through Facebook. \n\nLet\u2019s make this our best year yet 🙌😷🦠\nMom #parenting10 #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":41,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Aimee Hairr on August 16, 2020.

I came here as one type of person; one type of nurse.\n\nFaceTime calls with a patients loved ones has become as routine as checking vitals. Daily, lengthy telephone updates, trying to calm the anxious, hearing the frustration of our no visitors policy, and hearing the tears and cries when we have to give bad news.\n\nTypically, pre corona, we had years of science on our side. We understood complicated disease processes, we had treatment plans, medications, and a plan of care. But now? It\u2019s all out the window. We have anecdotal medications and treatments. We don\u2019t really know if what we\u2019re doing is the best care. We don\u2019t understand the disease process, the tornado it causes on the other systems of the body, if there\u2019s any valuable correlation between antibodies and long term protection. We have hypotheses.\n\nSo when families ask us questions and we\u2019re left saying, \u201CI don\u2019t know\u201D it frustrates us as much as it frustrates them. Because we\u2019re used to knowing, to having answers, and knowing how to save our patients.\n\nOur days are spent worrying about oxygen saturation, trusting our nursing gut when something is off but we can\u2019t explain it, increasing oxygen delivery, updating families, coordinating with the physicians, praying we have an ICU bed available when our patient is tanking.\n\nWe are running out of beds, out of ventilators, out of vapotherms. Our staff is getting covid in waves. We\u2019re treating our coworkers. We run and nurse all day long and when we get home it catches up with us.\n\nWe are tired. We are exhausted. We are bruised and battered. We are crying because we have our patients for days or weeks and we become attached to them and their families. We bond and love and care for them like they\u2019re our own family. And our hearts are fucking breaking.\n\nWear a mask. Wash your hands. Be considerate. Help us so we can help you. We became nurses to save lives; not to send them to the morgue.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#coronavirusnurses #travelnurse #travelnurselife #travelnursing #gypsynurse #gypsynurselife #coronavirus #covid19nurse #frontlineheroes #pandemic2020 #pandemicnurse","NumberOfLikes":38,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":13,"Timestamp":1597631576,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 04:32:56 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Tim hore ...

Forcing himself on people with no mask. This is what evangelicalism looks like. This creep works for @graceroofcleaning. Please be aware. He is dangerous. I\u2019ve honestly never seen such a thing. Read on:👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼\n\nHe forced his way into a crowd of CHILDREN repeatedly, who were just peacefully telling their stories and using sidewalk chalk. This is horrifying behavior for anyone, especially an adult cis male. \n\nHe showed up with a speaker blaring, screaming about people burning in hell and how BLM is evil, with two other men. When he tried to get into the area where the children were people made a human wall and he refused to stop forcing himself on them. \n\nNobody assaulted him, but he definitely touched some women inappropriately (one woman had her vagina grabbed), and refused to leave when asked. This is just a piece of what transpired. He also climbed halfway up a pine tree. Honestly, he needs psychological help and should not be in public spaces, especially where children are present. 😳\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#blmmovement #blmprotest #blacklivesmatter #evangelical #christians #evangelicals #assault #preacher #whiteviolence #christianity #toxicmasculinity #whiteprivilege #whitesupremacy #racisminamerica #racialjustice #socialjustice #protests2020 #nojusticenopeace #protest #blm #jesuswasblack #hypocrite #evangelize #pandemic2020 #mentalhealth #dangerousman #zealot #fanatic #fanaticism #protectthechildren","NumberOfLikes":13,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":13,"Timestamp":1597628113,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 03:35:13 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#_ok_covid_ ✖️ #bcshoots \n.\n.\n. \n.\n\n#isolationphotography #isolation #isolationlife #coronavirus #covid19 #pandemic #pandemic2020 #wearamask #weareinthistogether #newnormal #stayathome #stayhome #physicadistancing #massisolationaus #streetphotography #instagram #instadaily #photography #photooftheday","NumberOfLikes":5,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @_ok_covid_ in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

We went to a couple bike shops yesterday and as expected not one had what I was looking for, just something to cruise around the neighborhood on.  The first store we went to a woman and her son were waiting for repairs.  She overheard us talking to the salesperson and when we left said she had a pink bike I could just have but it needed a little tune up.  We were shocked by her offer.  She said everyone is in need of a little extra happiness these days and she gave me her number if I decided to take her up on her offer.  Sooooo, I now have a bike!  Just like that, and when I\u2019m finally able to get the one I want I will be gifting this bike to someone else. \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#payitforward #goodpeoplestillexist #bikesofinstagram #cruisin #schwinnroxie #summervibes #pandemic2020 #findingjoy #newhobby #lifeisgood #lifeofablogger #lifeofapilotswife #lifeofashooterswife","NumberOfLikes":26,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Ｍｉａ  Ｒｈｏｄｅ on August 16, 2020.

Built in 1953, the green, retro, Art Deco building looks much the same as it did onscreen. It\u2019s located at \u202A1830 Winona Boulevard\u202C in the Los Feliz area of Los Angeles. Please note that this is a private residence so if you visit please do not trespass or disturb the people that live there.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t seen this popular series yet, it basically gives viewers an insight into the mind of Joe, who is stalking the women he loves. Based on a series of novels, the second season is loosely based on the novel \u201CHidden Bodies\u201D by Caroline Kepnes - which picks up with Joe where the first season left off. That\u2019s all I\u2019ll say. I don\u2019t want to give any spoilers for those if you who haven\u2019t seen the series yet. \n\nGood news for fans of the show...an official return date hasn't been announced just yet, but Netflix has renewed the series for a third season!\n\nFun facts - It's hard to imagine anyone else playing Joe, but Penn Badgley was unsure about taking the role at first.  In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said he was \"conflicted\" about the part, largely because the show is framed as a love story. \"If this is a love story, what is it saying?\" he said. Ultimately, discussions with showrunners convinced him to take the part. \n\nDue to the fact that most of Joe\u2019s lines are actually voiceover, Penn said that most days he wouldn't have much dialogue to actually memorize. In fact, Penn\u2019s first acting jobs were doing voiceovers for a radio station and Nintendo 64 video games when he was only 10 years old.  #filminglocation #losfeliz #younetflix #pennbadgley #hollywoodtour #pandemic2020 #socialdistancing #wearamask #tonymiros @younetflix","NumberOfLikes":46,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1597598564,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 16 19:22:44 CEST 2020","Location":"Los Feliz\/ Hollywood Hills"},{"CaptionText":"Umm can we talk about that freak thunderstorm we just had!!?!
