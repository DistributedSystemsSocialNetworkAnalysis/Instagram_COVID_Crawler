Let's hope for a SMILE. üòä\n.\n.\nP.S: Even the photoshoot with mask is a new trend. üòÅüò∑\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#mask #masks \n#smile #maskfree \n#life #pandemic #pandemic2020 #coronavirus \n#covid19 #hope #twin_lense__  #wahhkolkata \n#portrait #photography #nature #naturephotography","NumberOfLikes":84,"Hashtags":["#mask","#masks","#smile","#maskfree","#life","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#coronavirus","#covid19","#hope","#twin_lense__","#wahhkolkata","#portrait","#photography","#nature","#naturephotography"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Satyajit Chakraborty in Gajol, West Bengal, India with @twin_lens__.

The pandemic has certainly changed things, it\u2019s not what it used to be and the show I worked last night wasn\u2019t even the usual company I work for! \n\nIt\u2019s been a couple years since I worked for @cwe.canada and it\u2019s an environment I truly missed. Every locker room has similarities and every one of them has differences. The difference I enjoy with CWE is actually change, the roster always can change and you can work with a multitude of peers that you haven\u2019t before from other provinces and promotions. A few of my favourite moments were filming promos with people I\u2019ve known for years but never worked with like @lumberjack_larrywoods and @the_cheetahbear . \n\nBeing a travelling roadshow of a promotion CWE isn\u2019t without a heathy dose of new experiences and learning opportunities as well, like trying to amass a float for the door at 6pm on a Friday night when banks are closed because a truck broke down and the float would be late to putting together a newly built ring for the first time. But no matter those hurdles or any other the company always persevered and puts on a great show from bell to bell  that engages and entertains the fans.\nI can say without any embellishment that I really missed working with CWE.\n\nCovid 19 has changed the world in so many ways, it could be another 6 months or more before I work another show, but I\u2019m glad I had the opportunity to get out there with my peers and in front of a crowd again. The tight suit also reminded me its time to drop a few lbs.

Especially surrounding corona virus itself. \n\nWith lockdown being eased and things heading towards normality it can create whole new levels of anxiety since corona is still out there. \n\nSome tips to deal with pandemic induced anxiety are:\n\n\u2022 Talk about your worries - talk to someone who understands. A good old natter can take some of that weight off of your shoulders.\n\u2022 Feel prepared - if you are worried about the virus itself make sure you have everything you need for example, masks & hand sanitiser. \n\u2022 FACTTTTT CHECK - at the start of the pandemic there was so much FAKE NEWS going around about corona virus. Stick to the facts. Only look at trusted& credible sources\/ resources such as WHO and the government website. \n\u2022 Limit your time watching corona virus coverage and news as it can be anxiety inducing.\n\u2022 Focus on the now - it\u2019s easier said than done but just take each day at a time. It\u2019s not worth spending your days worrying about something that likely won\u2019t happen. \n\u2022 If you aren\u2019t back in work still, find a focus, something to do with your time. Maybe a hobby. Daily exercise. Start a blog. Take a course. KEEP BUSY. \n\nDon\u2019t be too hard on yourself. Some people may find returning to normality easier than others. But we are all different it\u2019s ok to take your time and be cautious. \n\nIf you have friends worried about the pandemic, don\u2019t pressure them to go out and do things if they are not ready. Listen to them and be there for them. \n\nFinally Samaritans are always there if you need someone to talk to: üì±üëâüèº 116 123 üëàüèºüì± \n\nüíûüíñüíûüíñüíûüíñüíûüíñüíûüíñüíûüíñüíûüíñ\n\n#coronavirus #pandemic #anxiety #mentalhealth #mentalhealthmondays  #coronamemes #coronavirusmemes #coronavirusanxiety #covid19 #covid_19üò∑ #pandemic2020 #pandemicanxiety #cardib #cardibmemes","NumberOfLikes":60,"Hashtags":["#coronavirus","#pandemic","#anxiety","#mentalhealth","#mentalhealthmondays","#coronamemes","#coronavirusmemes","#coronavirusanxiety","#covid19","#covid_19üò∑","#pandemic2020","#pandemicanxiety","#cardib","#cardibmemes"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597519160,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 21:19:20 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#facemasksforsale #facecovering #fabric #facemasks #facemask#supportlpcalbuissness #shoplocal#handmademasks#handmadefacemasks #pandemic2020#masksforsale #masksup2020#maskforkids##adultmask#menmask#womensmasks #madeincanada #shopcanadian#madeintoronto #s·¥ú·¥ò·¥ò·¥è Ä·¥õ ü·¥è·¥Ñ·¥Ä üs ú·¥è·¥òs #supportlocal #masksforall #staysafe #wereinthistogther #wegotthis#corona2020 #coronavirus#kids #maskon #staysafe #stayhome","NumberOfLikes":3,"Hashtags":["#facemasksforsale","#facecovering","#fabric","#facemasks","#facemas","#supportlpcalbuissness","#shoploca","#handmademask","#handmadefacemasks","#pandemic202","#masksforsale","#masksup202","#maskforkid","#adultmas","#menmas","#womensmasks","#madeincanada","#shopcanadia","#madeintoronto","#s·¥ú·¥ò·¥ò·¥è Ä·¥õ ü·¥è·¥Ñ·¥Ä üs ú·¥è·¥òs","#supportlocal","#masksforall","#staysafe","#wereinthistogther","#wegotthi","#corona2020","#coronaviru","#kids","#maskon","#staysafe","#stayhome"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @masksup2020 on August 15, 2020.

Someone's words or actions, shouldn't be the reason for anything in your life. ü§ó\n\n5- Some pauses are a gift. 2020 is one of them!

I was sitting at my kitchen table and the sun was shining perfectly through the blinds. I was sad. I was lonely. I was suffering from panic attacks which I had never experienced before. My relationship had just ended and I was struggling and still am. I didn\u2019t have the support from my friends that I wanted (the physical support) due to the pandemic so I was physically alone. I had this huge feeling of emptiness. I wasn\u2019t eating or sleeping well. I knew these feelings would be temporary or at least I hoped they would be. So I decided to pack up and go see family for much needed support. I\u2019m so glad I did because it has helped tremendously. \n\u2022\nThe pandemic in itself has caused a lot of confusion and pain for people. Add on the racial and political climate to make you feel even more confused and sad. I\u2019m still sad. I still struggle daily with what\u2019s going on in my life and the world around me. Every day I feel better. Every day is a little brighter. I recognize my feelings. I recognize the blessings I have. I recognize the exciting bright future I have ahead. \n\u2022\nOpening up even a little bit about my feelings is very hard for me. Therapy has been a huge help for me over the years and recent weeks to get more in tune with my true self. It\u2019s been challenging, frustrating, sad, exciting, and rewarding. It\u2019s a work in progress. WE are a work in progress.

Dr. Sapolsky\u2019s research is primarily in ùóØùóÆùóØùóºùóºùóªùòÄ & he\u2019s studied, for example, how the vigilance of being lower status in a hierarchy affects production of stress hormones. \n.\nüí° Sapolsky\u2019s work highlights that being lower status in a hierarchy is only more stressful (caveat: this is in primates!) when that hierarchy is relatively fixed. If the hierarchy is in flux and the primates at the top are constantly having to fight to maintain their higher status, then the higher status primates are more stressed than the lower status primates. \n.\nThere are plenty of ways to extend these findings to humans now in a moment when we\u2019re actively trying to disrupt entrenched systems, but I really want to highlight that ùòÇùóªùó∞ùó≤ùóøùòÅùóÆùó∂ùóªùòÅùòÜ drives our (human) interpretation of stress and we are living in ùò™ùòØùò§ùò≥ùò¶ùò•ùò™ùò£ùò≠ùò∫ ùò∂ùòØùò§ùò¶ùò≥ùòµùò¢ùò™ùòØ times.

We also live on the rim of a 800' gorge, 50 miles long, that runs through volcanic basalt. Deep in the narrow gorge, the Rio Grande flushes through with Class IV white water rapids. In ten minutes, we can drive down a deathly, curvaceous, narrow, washboard-ridden road and swim in the river's wider current, float a tube across it's gurgling belly. In 20 minutes, we can hike along a flowing mountain stream, carrying snow melt down from New Mexico's highest peak, Wheeler.\n\nBut up here on Taos's West Mesa, there's no water. That's why we have cisterns. Being the fancy dirt folk that we are, we got two of them, 1600 gallons each, probably 6-8 weeks worth with our indoor shower and washing machine going regularly. Soon, we'll have gutters to collect rain during the wild storm ambushes that gather over us once in a while. This year, the monsoons were already late and I heard friends who normally live off rain collection asking the phone number for the water delivery truck.\n\nThere is a community well down the road, which was installed only a few years back, just as the road was recently paved a few years before that. With a membership, you can drive your water containers over there to be filled. Perhaps one day that will seem like a necessary expense.\n\nToday, we have a five gallon jug perched over our sink that we usually use for camping. Fortunately, we had kept it filled due to the current pandemic. We await the water truck while our sink fills with dirty dishes.\nRead more in blog...link in bio...\n.\n.\n.\n#watercatchment #waterislife #waterconservation #watercollection #offgridbuilding #offgrid #offgridhome #offgridliving #sustainableliving #conservation #climatechange #environmentalism #writinglife #writersblog #pandemic2020 #shelterinplace","NumberOfLikes":17,"Hashtags":["#watercatchment","#waterislife","#waterconservation","#watercollection","#offgridbuilding","#offgrid","#offgridhome","#offgridliving","#sustainableliving","#conservation","#climatechange","#environmentalism","#writinglife","#writersblog","#pandemic2020","#shelterinplace"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Johanna DeBiase in Taos County, New Mexico.

In the US, only 40% of average people have no symptoms.\u2060\n\u2060\nThe reason is adaptive immunity. When your body is constantly exposed to bacteria, viruses, and other microbes, your immune system gets stronger.\u2060\n\u2060\nIt\u2019s why experienced ER docs don\u2019t get sick as often as new docs, and why frequent flyers don\u2019t get sick when they fly compared to occasional flyers.\u2060\n\u2060\nThe people in these data sets get lots of germs so their immune systems already know how to handle similar coronaviruses.\u2060\n\u2060\nThe reason this matters to you is that all this social distancing and hand sanitizer is depriving your immune system of almost all the environmental microbes that are required to keep you strong.\u2060\n\u2060\nRegularly exposing yourself to low doses of other people\u2019s bacteria is the immune system equivalent of mild exercise every day for your cardiovascular system.\u2060\n\u2060\nWhen things finally \u201Copen up\u201D and we stop submerging ourselves in vats if toxic hand sanitizer, your immune system is going to be *way* out of shape. And you\u2019re going to pick up every cold and flu for a while until you get strong again, with far worse environmental allergies.\u2060\n\u2060\nThe longer we wait, the weaker your immune system gets.\u2060\n\u2060\nWhat can you do?\u2060\n-Get outside where there is soil with microbes in it.\u2060\n-Lose that 20 pounds.\u2060\n-Ditch the inflammatory seed oils, especially corn, canola, and soy.\u2060\n-Sleep like a pro\u2060\n-Dramatically cut sugar\u2060\n-Exercise but don\u2019t go hard every day so you can recover\u2060\n-Go grass-fed, or even the Bulletproof Diet which is designed to reduce inflammation","NumberOfLikes":11,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Sarpy Chiropractic in Omaha, Nebraska.

It's beautiful to say the least.\n\n#bookreviewüëá\n\n\"You never came to stay; you never left to return. I never loved to un-love you, and that is the tragedy of my ordinary life.\"\n\n'With Love' is a collection of letters, each very deep and special in its own way. There's a longing for lost love and friendship. There are letters that talk of estranged relationships, and others which speak of people who you felt the closest to not having enough time for you. And then, there are letters which are ambiguous and reading through them you can't figure out who's written them to whom unless you reach the very end. These letters make you raise some very important questions, questions which you try answering but can't. \n\nThere were letters which made me smile, others which made me cry, a few which reminded me of people who have been a part of my life in the past and others that I have loved. There were a few that made me keep the book down and made me sympathise with people who have lived through tragedies. There are letters that talk about ends and others about beginnings. Some about heartbreaks, others about hope. Some about love and others about fear. \n\nA letter made me raise a very important question which was- How do you decide it's time to leave a friendship, a relationship, even a marriage?\nThere was one letter in particular which made me realise how we often contemplate things and don't do them and regret it later. And one made me think how we feel stupid for our actions when in reality all they are is cute. \n\nAll in all this anthology of letters was full of realisations for me. It evoked feelings that I didn't know existed within me. It brought about a flurry of emotions and I was forced to sit back and reflect and give myself closure on things that lie there hanging. It was a book which proved helpful to me in a way no one ever has.\n\nRead it to feel things. Read it to reminisce a beautiful past and be assured that a great future lies ahead.","NumberOfLikes":329,"Hashtags":["#qotd-","#bookreviewüëá"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by JAPNEET\u2022BOOKSTAGRAM\u2022IN üáÆüá≥ in Delhi, India with @booknerdparadise, @booksparks, @penguinindia, @ttt_official, @penguinbooks, @flatlay_gallery, @flatlay, @theb00kstagram, @flatlayindia, @ig.reads, @igreadsindia, @mybookfeatures, @midlandbooksofficial, @bookishladiesclub, @flatlaysquad, @bookishfeatures_, @perksofbookstagram, @bookreviewfeatures, and @flatlayphotographers.","NumberOfComments":57,"Timestamp":1597491616,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 13:40:16 CEST 2020","Location":"Delhi, India"},{"CaptionText":"Help, I got \"Pussy Monster\" by Lil Wayne stuck in my head and it won't go away ü•¥ #ButFirstASelfie #SelfiesForSelfLove #SelfieNation #SelfieGram #PhotoOfTheDay #Quarantine #Pandemic #Pandemic2020 #Coronavirus #Covid #Covid19 #Kawaii #KawaiiGirl #KawaiiGoth #BubbleGoth #PastelGoth #PastelGrunge #AltGirl #AltGirls #AlternativeGirl #AlternativeGirls #Thicc #ThickChick #NewHair #DyedHair","NumberOfLikes":18,"Hashtags":["#ButFirstASelfie","#SelfiesForSelfLove","#SelfieNation","#SelfieGram","#PhotoOfTheDay","#Quarantine","#Pandemic","#Pandemic2020","#Coronavirus","#Covid","#Covid19","#Kawaii","#KawaiiGirl","#KawaiiGoth","#BubbleGoth","#PastelGoth","#PastelGrunge","#AltGirl","#AltGirls","#AlternativeGirl","#AlternativeGirls","#Thicc","#ThickChick","#NewHair","#DyedHair"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by üç≠ü¶Ñ UnicornPlushy ü¶Ñüç≠ on August 15, 2020.

Our death count is now at 21. Cases, albeit slower than before, are still surfacing.\u2063\n\u2063\nAs per my last update, I\u2019m leaning into the narratives and stories that occupy my headspace.\u2063\n\u2063\nSome days there is insurmountable self-doubt, insecurities, anxiety, fear of not helping, not making a difference, not being heard, being a failure, imposter syndrome, and extreme sadness at the world we live in and the injustices all around us. \u2063\n\u2063\nSome of these insecurities stem from social and cultural conditioning of what is deemed 'successful\u2019 at my age. No house, no kids, no fancy car, no esteemed career, etc. After reflecting, I\u2019ve realised that I have consciously traded in crippling debt and security for freedom.\u2063\n\u2063\nOther days I\u2019m overcome with gratitude and love for my life, my friends, my family, the journey I\u2019m on, and the self-awareness that comes with deep healing from previous relationships, and childhood trauma.\u2063\n\u2063\nOften, I find myself wanting to rush the journey. To be 'healed' and \u2018fixed\u2019 and get to all the juicy stuff on the other side. Then I pause, and remember, there is no other side. This is a committed practice of mindfulness, awareness, self-love, empathy, and compassion. \u2063ü•∞\n\u2063\nYou can\u2019t find happiness outside of yourself. And, you have to go through shit to find the answers. These answers raise more questions, and the cycle begins again.\u2063 üíì\n\u2063\nIt took a lot of courage to share this today, my finger has been hovering over the post button for a weirdly long time.

They were providing pedicure\/manicure outdoors on their side walk, guys how genius is that, huh? I then just flipped my car around and drove back to check it out. I had to sign a waiver to have a pedicure which I did. They did not have a massage chair available so I just had a pedicure Brazilian style with a container wrapped in a plastic cover and filled with water. There was a glass separating the pedicure lady and I. Everyone was wearing masks, gloves, they had some sort of tents put in place to try to minimize the high heat. The lady told me it was their first day having customers in that setting outdoors. My feet were a walking disaster. I felt such relief and excitement to know I could have my needs met. On the other hand as I started talking to the pedicure lady she told me she was from Anaheim (3 hours away with traffic from my city) and that she had a son who just started having distance learning). I could not help thinking to myself: \u201Cwho is taking care of her family needs?\u201D We are dealing with a horrible pandemic where so many people are struggling to make ends meet. Some of us are in a position of privilege with access to a stable income, we have our bills paid, food in our fridges but how about everyone else? It just broke my heart to realize this strong lady came from far away to work under the heat to make sure her family needs were at least partially met. I left the outside tent sweating and those hard workers were probably going to stay there all day long. I gave her a bigger tip in cash, got her card. I wished her the best of luck and told her to stay safe and be strong! Her name was Regina and she is one in a million of workers out there in the trenches who desperately need and want to work but due to the circumstances are laid off or fired. Unemployment is skyrocketing. Please let\u2019s keep in mind our fellow brothers and sisters who need our support right now. Any act of kindness would make a huge difference in their lives.

I feel like we're getting back to the way it should have been all along. Enjoying each other's company, talking to our friends, spending longer at the dinner table. Those are the things that matter. I pray my kids look back on this pandemic as a happy time. Sure, everything is different now. But it's better in a lot of ways (not all ways). I have a lot more I want to say but I'll save it for another post on another day.\u2063\n\u2063\nTell me one of your silver linings from the pandemic!","NumberOfLikes":22,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Amanda Johnson in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

It\u2019s definitely not the ideal situation, but now that I\u2019ve been in it for 4 months, I\u2019ve learned some things:\n.\n1. It really shouldn't have taken a pandemic to force me to slow down.\n.\nBefore quarantine my life was FILLED with activity - dance classes, birthday parties, happy hours, movies, game nights, dinner and lunches with friends, church events, volunteering, etc. I barely had a night off. Sounds like I\u2019m a social butterfly. Truth is I\u2019m an introvert that has trouble saying no and does not want to lose connection with my friends. I have no relatives in Austin, so my friends are my fam.\n.\nMy calendar would start off simple. Fill in the requests with advanced notice, no reason to say no. They gave me time. What about that movie coming out or that restaurant I have to try. Put it on the calendar. Don\u2019t forget so and so\u2019s birthday, and wait, I haven\u2019t seen these people in weeks, I have to hang out real soon. I have a spot open on Friday. There fills my calendar! Also once I say yes, I rarely cancel. (If I do, I feel horrible about it.)\n.\nWhen we got put on lockdown, it all stopped and honestly I wasn\u2019t sad. I was relieved. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I miss seeing my friends. When we did stuff together, it was fun. However I\u2019ve got to learn to take time for myself and regenerate. I\u2019ve been reveling in the nearly empty calendar. Which leads me to the 2nd thing I\u2019ve learned:\n.\n2. Your friends don\u2019t stop being your friends because of a pandemic.\n.\nIf you truly care about people, you find ways to connect. There are Zoom calls, regular calls, text messages, group chats, social distancing get-togethers, emails, Slack, heck even regular mail. I\u2019m still engaging with my friends. I didn\u2019t become a hermit.\n.\nI do look forward to the day when things are more \u201Cnormal.\u201D I\u2019ll get in all the hugs, I\u2019ll see all the people, but I\u2019ll also be a better advocate for my own free time.\n.\n- Shavanna Pinder  07\/16\/20\n@theshavdesign","NumberOfLikes":22,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":9,"Timestamp":1597440641,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 14 23:30:41 CEST 2020","Location":"Austin, Texas"},{"CaptionText":"#pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":3,"Hashtags":["#pandemic2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Michael Joseph Niemeyer in East Goshen Park.

O acesso se d√°, majoritariamente, por uma estrada municipal de terra em condi√ß√µes prec√°rias. As comunidades enfrentam s√©rios problemas de abastecimento de √°gua, atrelado a isso, temos tamb√©m casos de fam√≠lias que precisam viver sem energia el√©trica, uma vez que a rede el√©trica n√£o contempla aquelas que moram mais distantes do \u201Ccentro das comunidades\u201D.\nAtualmente os moradores tamb√©m passam por s√©rias dificuldades econ√¥micas. A renda da maioria das fam√≠lias, devido √† proximidade da comunidade com a cidade de Montes Claros, se d√° por empregos formais e informais. Por√©m, devido a pandemia do novo corona v√≠rus muitos empregados foram demitidos e as fam√≠lias ficaram √† merc√™ do aux√≠lio emergencial ou da ajuda de associa√ß√µes de volunt√°rios.\n.\nNesse sentido, nosso objetivo √© arrecadar um montante total de 2.000,00 (dois mil reais) que ser√£o convertidos na compra e distribui√ß√£o de cestas b√°sicas para os moradores de Palmito e Bico da Pedra.

The table had a number and QR code that when scanned brought us to a list of all the restaurants and how to order from them. Wine was brought to our table by Lauren, the owner of Rebel Rebel and it was so nice to chat with her about business during this time. The atmosphere was fun, but felt totally chill and safe. No rowdiness or people breaking the rules. They had arrows on the ground for us to follow the correct flow of foot traffic. There were beautiful lights, potted plants, wooden partitions, proper signage, ample hand sanitizing stations, and it felt great to be there.

We never know when it would be our last day. And the most disturbing emotion that people feel, after experiencing life at first hand, is \"regret.\"¬†¬†The regret of not saying things when there was time.\n\nThis year was quite a disturbing one. But we can't just say that life was more promising before all of this. \n\nSo, the question that I wonder about is 'why?' Why do people not say things before it is too late? Why people can go the extra mile to prove someone wrong but can never express how much they love each other. And it is not about the people that are close to us. It is about expressing gratitude to all the people that ever had an impact on us. Why can't we just speak about the moments when someone¬†appreciated us or¬†made us feel special.\n\nI thought about starting this account a lot. I backed off many times. I just talked myself out of it, saying that what can I even do with this.\n\nBut this pandemic made me confident about giving my drop of sanity to this vast insane ocean. No matter how small it is.\n\nAs the name suggests, Patra (a Hindi word that means letter in English), this account is about me writing letters to all humans and characters that ever impacted me. One who reads these posts can also write letters to the same person, about your favourite memory of them.

Parents only see what is RECOMMENDED in the news media. They have not received any detailed information from their district on precisely what WILL AND WILL NOT OCCUR with regard to transportation in their district. This is the most comprehensive written information that I have been able to find on Transportation.  If your district is using this great and if they are not feel free to provide this to them as a recommendation.\n\nThe only concern that I have with regard to this is that illistration for seating arrangements without masks alludes to the thought that the wearing of a mask somehow allows social distancing grace. The CDC recommendations do not define hand washing, the where of a mask, and social distancing as interchangeable protective measures. You cannot excuse yourself from wearing a mask just because you decide to wash your hands frequently. You cannot excuse yourself from social distancing just because you've decided to wear a mask. That said, transportation needs to re-assess proposed seating arrangements.\n\nParents please stay informed and be vigilant.

This is why we are raising awareness and having necessary conversations. \nThis will also be an opportunity for you to ask questions. Join me and Dr Taylor as we bring our experience and present you with the latest clinical research. \n\nDr Yisade Taylor is training in women\u2019s health as a specialist in Obsterics and Gynaecology and also has a Master\u2019s of Science in this area.
