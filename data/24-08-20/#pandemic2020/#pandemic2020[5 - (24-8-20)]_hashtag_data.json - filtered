Pandora's box is open.  Welcome.\n Controlling the system through digital slavery.  Exploitation will be a blessing.  The purchase of significantly cheaper global manufacturing assets will begin soon.\n The Central Bank, Central Banks, the Basel Committee give recommendations to all the Central Banks of the World.  The center of global government is in Basel, Switzerland.\n Those who did not support became Outcasts.\n Syria, Iran, North Korea.\n All current business models are not sustainable and must be revised.  This is an obvious Fact.\n This is how a new world is born.  Globalization has occurred through the World Financial System.  The public still loves dollars, and the Fed is ready to print them in the amount needed to buy all the debt obligations.  It is about buying up the assets of the industrial sector of the world economy.\n The unit of calculation is a significant element of the system.  The pandemic is just a cover.  In the near future, the Eurozone will be torn apart by inequality and imbalances in the deepening economic crisis.  Artificial Deficit of financial liquidity.

Everyone\u2019s worlds have been turned upside down. Some are able to handle that better than others. Some are dealing with heightened anxiety, stress, and\/or depression for various reasons and each of these things look different for everyone.\n\nAs someone who has anxiety and mild depression, this pandemic pushed me over the edge due to everything going on in the world combined with other stressful moments in my life that I\u2019d like to keep private out of respect for who those moments involve. I never had extreme physical anxiety symptoms until this year. I truly had no idea what was happening at first. I sought medical care multiple times and each time was told I was fine (thank God!). But the symptoms persisted. I was also losing more sleep than usual and having more mental breakdowns than usual. I noticed myself withdrawing from certain friends\/family and doing the complete opposite to other friends\/family. Basically, it got to the point where I finally decided to see a counselor specialized in anxiety. I put off seeing one for years but after my first meeting, I felt silly as to why I waited so long.\n\nNone of this might seem major to you. Or you may resonate with me. Either way, I hope you understand the importance of making mental health a priority and making YOURSELF a priority. I know it\u2019s easier said than done but don\u2019t be afraid to seek the help you need.\n\nI\u2019m sharing this with you all because I like to be fully transparent. As a blogger who chooses to share many moments of joy and lots of light hearted content like makeup, food, lifestyle, etc, I choose to share the raw and real moments as well. We\u2019re all human. We\u2019re all navigating through our own difficult moments.

At the same time, many are falling ill with #COVID_19 while also enduring the largest wage losses amid the pandemic-triggered recession. In San Joaquin and other rural counties, these workers often live in spaces not meant for human habitation. They are scared that their immigration status will be used against them if they don\u2019t comply with landlords, and they have little access to either legal advice or government aid. Federal relief funds that sent $1,200 #stimulus payments to Americans excluded most of these families. The state\u2019s Judicial Council is expected Thursday to extend its eviction ban until the end of the month, preventing court-sanctioned ousters, but such safeguards are not honored in this shadow market.

I want more than anything to be able to teach these kids again and know that however it looks I will give them the best possible experience I can.  I\u2019m trying not to think too far ahead, the experiences we continue to lose because of COVID.  I\u2019m trying to trust that this is all going to be okay, that we will stay healthy and safe.  But I\u2019m on the struggle bus today. \n\nI\u2019m trying to focus on what I can control.  I can still take care of myself by eating right, enjoying an occasional treat or white claw because this is life, friends, and working out every day. I\u2019m digging into my clients, my coaching team.  I love taking care of people so this is truly filling my cup. \n\nHow\u2019s everyone dealing with this stress?  What are you doing to take care of yourself?  It is more important than ever to take care of YOU.  Need some help with that?  I\u2019m here and ready to help you. We have an amazing sale for August, $20 off promo codes and parents and teachers\u2026 I have another special for you.  want to help get you started and make sure you have a positive community to belong to, and have a routine to take care of yourself.  That\u2019s about all we can control right now.  Are you in?\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#backtoschool #anxiety #feelingstressed #emotionalrollercoaster #pandemic2020 #summer2020 #stressrelief #stressmanagement #takecareofyourself #controlwhatyoucancontrol #surroundyourselfwithpositivepeople #itstartswithyou #physicalhealth #mentalhealth #teacherssupportteachers #parentssupportingparents #letsdothistogether #girlmomma #momofteens #twinmomma #wecandohardthings","NumberOfLikes":30,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Shannon Stevenson on August 13, 2020.

Ao t√©rmino desse projeto, queria continuar a rela√ß√£o com a comunidade e numa conversa com uma das lideran√ßas, o Benki Piy√£ko, entendi que a demanda deles era um projeto de educa√ß√£o que os ensinasse a fotografar, a aprender a utilizar essa ferramenta. Fizemos a primeira oficina em 2016, tamb√©m uma pesquisa de campo, para entender as demandas. A ideia do projeto desde sempre foi aprender com eles, a ideia de educa√ß√£o compartilhada. N√≥s chegamos com ideias e proposi√ß√µes mas √© a partir da vontade e demandas deles que n√≥s montamos a oficina.\u201D Pedro conta. \n____\nNeste post algumas imagens das oficinas j√° realizadas.

And boy has it been a trip. The last 5 years I have bounced from job to job to job and just hating everything about it... even when I went into my field. The good thing about that job was I met the love of my life @mcelroy.adam but I still didn't like it. Bounced around a few more jobs landing back in retail and then a pandemic happened. As the world was starting to open up again I decided to give it one more shot at the career job thing. I applied and went to a few interviews, and was not chosen for any of them. Then I saw an ad on @indeedworks for a case manager working with homeless families for a company that I worked with before, the YMCA. I sent my resume directly to them and got a response for an interview. I went on three more interviews after that and was selected for the position. I have only been here a month and a half and I see myself making moves here. I can use my skill set from working with kids to helping the adults find stability. And my great listening skills are the icing on the cake. I have never wanted a job so much that everyday I want to wake up and go to work. No day is the same as the last one. I finally found my career where if I made no money off of this, I would still be happy. #homeless #homelessness #homelessshelter #families #familieshelpingfamilies #casemanager #ymca #socialservices #socialserviceworker #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealth #psychology #mastersnumber2 #reflection #lovelife #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":20,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Jazzy Double H üëëüíã‚öìüç∑‚òïÔ∏èüêæüêæ in Massachusetts.

Being aware is important! ‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nIf you are pregnant, be proactive. Educate yourself about mental health during pregnancy. If you are suffering, talk to a professional. Remember mental health symptoms are common during pregnancy and postpartum, and can be effectively treated.‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nIt's okay to ask for help. If COVID-19 has taught us anything, it\u2019s that health is not solely the individual's responsibility, but is reliant on community. If you are pregnant or have recently given birth, make a list of concrete ways others can help you. For example, can a family member research support services in your area? Could neighbors cook meals that you could put in your freezer for later? Can you arrange for friends to pick up and do your laundry after the baby is born? It can be hard to ask for help but remind yourself it's a win-win. You get the support you need, and you offer others the opportunity to feel good and wrap around you all at the same time.‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\n#mindfulparenting #globalpandemic #pregnancyjourney #worldpandemic #pregnancybeyond #pregnancyblog #family‚ù§Ô∏è #pandemicbaby #pandemiclife #pandemictimes #pregnancytips #pandemicparenting #pandemicpregnancy #pandemicpreparedness #pandemic #pandemic2020 #pregnancydiary #gentleparenting #coronaviruspandemic #familymatters","NumberOfLikes":6,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The TNC Psychotherapy Group on August 13, 2020.

Arriving early, the sun was still too high to shoot, but as I paused for a moment, I suddenly felt drawn to Kuta's small lanes.\n\nLike many, I've had numerous experiences on and around these colorful streets; that allows the good, bad, and indifferent to flourish. But sadly, nothing could prepare me for what lay ahead.\n\nWith every step I took, my heart grew heavy as a relentless and uncomfortable feeling began to overwhelm me. Everything I knew, everything I remembered, had seemingly vanished, replaced by the view of a new harsh reality.\n\nA world of cold emptiness surrounded me, an unexpected every day seemingly decimated by an unseen enemy, leaving a silent trail of collateral damage - the very people that made this tiny part of the world so colorful.\n\nThe only thing that seems to remain now are the echoes of the past, a distant memory few believe will be found again.\n\nI stumbled across a man sitting alone, staring into the abyss of a screen designed to connect us. As we chatted, my heart sank further when he shared a parting thought.\n\n\"I don't think COVID will kill me, but I may die of hunger\".\n\nI did manage to watch the sunset, but as the beautiful sphere of hope drifted towards the horizon, I was acutely aware that this reality will rise again tomorrow.\n\nSWIPE FOR MORE PHOTOS‚û°Ô∏è‚û°Ô∏è\n\n#bali #balivscovid #pandemic2020 #balistrong #balibangkit #balinow #ilovebali #backtonormal #newnormal #balinewnormal #duecovid19 #supportbali #balispirit #hopeful #balivscorona","NumberOfLikes":15,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597326571,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 13 15:49:31 CEST 2020","Location":"Bali"},{"CaptionText":"Day 3-I have discovered watermelon!\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#littlebigfatfluffymonsterbaby #snickerstheguineapig #babyguineapig #guineapigsofinstagram #cavy #pandemic2020 #lockdown2020 #lockdownchronicles #miracleoflife #birth #dayone #guineapiglover #guineapigs #guineapiglife #spoiledguineapigs #lifeofpets #petsofinstagram #animalphotoraphy #guineapigphotography #smallanimals #exoticpets #guineapighabitat","NumberOfLikes":33,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597326562,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 13 15:49:22 CEST 2020","Location":"Long Island - New York"},{"CaptionText":"Acomp√°√±anos este viernes y conozcamos la otra cara de la pandemia, descubre c√≥mo es vivirla desde la trinchera m√©dica #coronavirus #pandemic2020 #pandemiam√©xico #quedateencasa #notedigo","NumberOfLikes":2,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by NO TE DIGO! on August 13, 2020.

The problem is that we're so busy trying to defend our fears in the act of attacking each other that we've lost sight of the fact that we need to take some responsibility in making a solution possible. \n\nThe bottom line is they're are going to have to get our children back into a learning environment but we also have to understand that it can't be the environment that we have all become formiliar with. There are ways to do this safely but we have to put the effort in the right place in order to make that happen.\n\nIf we're so focused on getting our children back in school by any means necessary the district will be under pressure to give parents what they are asking for (the reopening of school) rather than what our children need (a learning environment that has not cut corners in health and safety requirements to get them through the door).\n\nThere are very effective ways to get our children back into a learning environment where they can have face-to-face instruction where they can be in the presence of other children and they can take advantage of all of the benefits that they have become accustomed to in going to school.\n\nUnderstand that while a pandemic is a school concern it is not with in their area of expertise.

This last part left an open door and could be a sign of deep rooted changes to take place in the intelligence community. A few hours after this announcement, Trump announced that the virus was released from a lab in Wuhan and that the U.S has evidence of this and that he has seen this.

What's more? Acts of kindness have a positive effect not only on the receiver, but the giver, AND others who observe or hear about it! Isn't it amazing?\n\nSo we can be present by taking a moment to be kind to others. It shifts our minds from ruminating on stress from the past or worries of the future.\n\nDuring our current times (#pandemic) many people would appreciate the thoughtfulness. And if you believe that through grace, you've received lovingkindness, it's natural to pay it forward.\n\nActivity: Identify an act of kindness you'd like to do for someone. It could be someone you know or random. And observe the effects. Also make note of how others show you kindness.\n\nWould love to hear in the comments your intents, your experience with kindness, or any inspiring stories you've heard.\n\nShare with a friend to encourage them to be present through lovingkindness.\n\nBlessingsüíú","NumberOfLikes":13,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Health & Wellness Coaching on August 12, 2020 tagging @kathymansa, @carafernandez, @michelle.afia, @fleesh04, @gloriabrathwaite3, @michelekamiko, @mariaebinu, @winnie_art_photo, @fityourlifeyeg, @ayannagranger, @d_zeebakesandtreats, and @thecounselingconnect.

The vaccine has yet to complete its phase 3 trial, a crucial step that measures a candidate's effectiveness in a large population and can uncover rarer side effects. Phase 3 usually tests a vaccine's safety and efficacy on thousands of people across multiple locations.\nThe Russian Health Ministry said on Tuesday that the vaccine is expected to provide immunity from the coronavirus for up to two years.\nBut researchers don't yet know how long COVID-19 antibodies protect people from reinfection. So it's difficult to say how long an antibody-based vaccine could provide immunity, and it may take a while for scientists figure that out. Researchers are still learning about how long mumps and yellow fever vaccines last, and those have been around for decades.\nA prominent pharmaceutical organization in Russia, the Association of Clinical Trials, urged the Russian Ministry of Health to delay registration of the vaccine in a letter published on its website on Monday.\nThe letter also said developers had failed to follow \"the gold standard\" of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.\n\n#coronavirus #coronaviruspandemic #covidvaccine #covidvaccinelaunched #russia #russiacovid19 #vaccine #clinicaltrials #patients #covidpatients #covid19awareness #covidtreatment #pandemic #pandemic2020 #epidemic #virus2020 #healthcare #helathministry #immunity #disease #viralload","NumberOfLikes":24,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597246206,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 12 17:30:06 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"To combat horrible outbreaks of TB in the early 1900\u2019s, educators, physicians, researchers, and parents all agreed that educating children out of doors was the safest way to help in the fight against that scourge.

And honestly, we shouldn\u2019t!\n\nYes, we should try to keep them safe from a virus and teach them to look both ways when crossing the street but I think the hardest thing to accept as a parent is that they too will be thrown curve balls, have the rugged pulled from under them and be handed lemons. It\u2019s in those hard moments and after that their character is built.\n\nIt\u2019s when they can reflect back on actually getting through a hard time that they start to realize their own resiliency.\n\nThe difficult things... those are the things that allow them to build #selfworth #determination and #selfconfidence\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to give these things to our children. They must earn them.\n\nOur job is to set the example. Not by telling but by showing them how we handle these hard times.\n\nI found a handwritten note from my late husband Ryan a few months into the pandemic. It seemed very fitting. (Swipe to see)\n\nThe note read, \u201CThe measure of greatness is how you respond in tough times, these are tough times.\u201D\n\nWhen I stumbled upon the note I thought, \u201CWow!

Keep making the best decisions for your family with the information you have. Keep being the resilient amazing woman that you are. Keep looking for the light in the darkness.\n\nOne day, this particular time will be behind us and we will all reflect back knowing that we are stronger, more appreciative and more gracious because of it and our kids will notice that too.\n\nKeep being GREAT Mama...

When they are about to cross the Red Sea and the Israelites can see Pharaoh\u2019s army coming for them and they are filled with fear. \u201CBut Moses told the people, \u201CDon\u2019t be afraid. Just stand still and watch the Lord rescue you today...The Lord himself will fight for you. Just stay calm.\u201D\u2014Exodus 14:13-14\n‚ú®\nAs we go through the rollercoaster that is 2020 these words feel as relevant today as they were thousands of years ago when Moses spoke them.

More people are zoning out in front of the TV rather than turning to the Lord for help. So, I would like to encourage you to read your Bibles and spend time getting to know the Lord! Talk to him and ask for what you need! Even if you\u2019ve never prayed before, just start. If you have questions, ask Him. Allow Him to rescue you. We have access to the same God that parted the Red Sea and brought the Israelites out of slavery and into the Promised Land. Turning to Him should be our first reaction, not our last resort. ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\u201CAsk, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.\u201D\u2014Matthew 7:7","NumberOfLikes":12,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Maggie Rhodes on August 12, 2020.","NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1597237881,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 12 15:11:21 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"üìöESPA√ëOL‚úè A medida que los maestros y los ni√±os comienzan a regresar a la escuela en una situaci√≥n casi imposible, quer√≠amos mostrar nuestro amor y apoyo a las muchas familias afectadas por la pandemia del coronavirus, el desempleo y las dif√≠ciles decisiones que tuvieron que tomar tantos padres. üë©\u200Düè´üè§üë®\u200Düë©\u200Düëß\u200Düëß El #EquipodeReyesLegal esta orgulloso de patrocinar este \"Regalo para el Regreso a la Escuela por Drive-Thru\" organizado por la Liga Urbana de Jacksonville donde las familias podr√°n recibir una mochila ***GRATIS*** llena de material escolar por ni√±o. üßíüéíüëßüñç‚úÇÔ∏èüìî El evento se llevar√° a cabo *ESTE* s√°bado 15 de agosto de 2020 de 10:00 a 12:00 pm en 4 lugares diferentes:\n\u2022 Lado Norte (Northside)\n\u2022 Mandar√≠n\n\u2022 DownTown \n\u2022 Lado Sur (Southside)\n\n‚úèENGLISHüìö As teachers and children begin to go back to school in an almost impossible situation, we wanted to show our love and support for the many families affected by the coronavirus pandemic, unemployment, and the difficult decisions so many parents had to make. üë©\u200Düè´üè§üë®\u200Düë©\u200Düëß\u200Düëß The #ReyesLegalTeam is proud to sponsor this \"Back To School Drive-Thru Give Away\" organized by the Jacksonville Urban League where families will be able to receive a ***FREE*** backpack full of school supplies per child. üßíüéíüëßüñç‚úÇÔ∏èüìî The event will take place *THIS* Saturday, August 15, 2020 from 10:00 - 12:00pm in 4 different locations:\n\u2022 Northside \n\u2022 Mandarin\n\u2022 Downtown\n\u2022 Southside\n.\n.\n.\n#backtoschool #backtoschoolgiveaway #community #communityfirst #communitymatters #coronavirus #covid19 #therona #rona #goawaycoronavirus #quarentine #weareallinthistogether #socialdistancing #washyohands #pandemic2020 #coveryourcough #coveryourmouth #bewell #hispanicsbelike #latinosbelike #cuarentena #comunidad #regresoaclases #hispanos #latinos #abogadadeinmigracion #immigrationlawyer #immigrationattorney","NumberOfLikes":22,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597231756,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 12 13:29:16 CEST 2020","Location":"Jacksonville, Florida"},{"CaptionText":"The new Tidewater Family Plus is now available around the Greater Hampton Roads area! \nThinking about a career change but aren\u2019t sure where to begin?

It was one of the first few organised daycare chains in Mumbai, an entrepreneurial dream I had for years. We continued to grow our school and parents were so happy! Unfortunately, the lockdown happened and we were unprepared for it. We had to shut our daycare for obvious reasons, we had to pay our rents irrespective and like so many homegrown businesses we had no choice. The feeling was a terrible one because I was letting go off my 70 member family who had been with me for over a decade. But, entrepreneurs never turn their back and hence I have not given up on my dreams.\n\n \n\nIt was a lesson learnt for me. It is situations like this when I feel the need to prepare stronger and better in all aspects of life, especially financially. I plan to re-start my venture somewhere down the line and I need a solid financial plan that caters to my goals. A plan that not only grows my money but also takes care of my family in case of any uncertainty. After a few recommendations from friends and reviewing online platforms like Mouthshut, I found ICICI Pru Assured Savings plan to be a perfect fit for entrepreneurs like me. The plan not only offers a lump sum payout but also provides guaranteed additions every year to grow my money. Added to it, the reputation of ICICI Prudential Life gives me the confidence to achieve my long term goals and protect my loved ones from any uncertainty. Now by investing smartly, I will be prepared for such unforeseen events.\n\n \n\nTough times and wise decisions make tough entrepreneurs.\n\n \n\nTo know more: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2PKyo2f\n\n \n\nFor T\/C visit: https:\/\/bit.ly\/3ix2Nxb\n\n@iciciprulifeofficial\n#IciciPrudentialLife\n#LifeInsurance","NumberOfLikes":867,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":101,"Timestamp":1597232247,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 12 13:37:27 CEST 2020","Location":"Home Sweet Home ‚ù§"},{"CaptionText":"We care for you and in this pandemic, we have taken an initiative for your safety.

Within a night, many houses, schools, and even bridges on and along the riverside get washed into the river. And sometimes in the worst scenario even several villages get sunk into it.\n\nI interviewed this gentleman, last winter. Upendra Yadav works as a salesman in a medicine firm. Once a zamindar with around 30 bigha land, he has now relocated to a village away from the river and owns around 12 Katha land only. That too he earned with his sweat and blood over the years as a migrant worker in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, and New Delhi. His native village was situated on the northern frontier of gopalganj, boarding with Champaran. This region is called Dieara, which is one of the adversely affected areas in monsoon.\n\nIt was 1990, the Gandak's flow was very wild and it had begun eroding the agricultural land of his village. And within days, his home, his land, and even his livelihood completely faded away. All that once was a happy and fertile place was turned into a riverbed. The homeless natives moved to nearby towns and had to start from point-blank. Although the flow of the river has changed its course over time. what now left is only sand and barren land, where nothing grows. Upendra recalls only once they got seven thousand rupees as compensation for their now dead farming. Although he and many others from his village still apply for mutation of their land in government registry records fearing encroachment by other villagers and even mafia. Lately, the swallowing river not only snatched their hard-earned house and livelihood but their ancestral roots and culture excessively.\n\nAnd stories like that of Upendra matter and are needed to be told and shared.\n\nThe recent flood-like always will make many new Upendra who will flood into your concrete -hearted cities.\n \n#wokerslife #pandemic2020 \n#undiscoveredindia #biharfloods #noworktoday #rurallife #flooding","NumberOfLikes":52,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597180728,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 11 23:18:48 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Welcome to THE BOX. \nAs Robin Williams used to say, \n\u201CWelcome to my mind\u201D\nThis is me bearing my soul and healing my mind through the revelation of story.\nArt is supposed to disturb the comfortable and comfort the disturbed.

ZERO. \n\nIt was the most absolutely awful time of my life to date, which is saying a lot.
