I have people in my life that choose to look at all the \u201Cnegative\u201D experiences in their lives and blame those experiences for their current circumstances. \n\nAnd I get so annoyed. Irritated. Frustrated. Triggered.\n\nAnd then I heard that your triggers are a reflection into yourself. \n\nI reflected on that and then decided it didn\u2019t pertain to THIS situation. 😂😂\n\nBut seriously, I was in denial.\n\nUntil it clicked! I had to ask myself \u201CWhere are you playing the victim in your own life?\u201D. Ahhhh, yeah, maybe there is something here.\n\nI was putting the responsibility to heal from my old trauma on other people. I expected those that hurt me to fix me. \n\nAnd I thought it made sense.\n\nUntil I realized that I am an adult and I am responsible for myself. And that includes my own healing. It is not anyone else\u2019s responsibility to heal old wounds. That\u2019s on me to heal.\n\nAnd when I finally accepted this, I began to take control of my healing. I stopped waiting for someone else to heal these wounds, and I started looking within.\n\nIn order to heal the way I needed to, I had to learn self awareness. I had to look inwardly with curiosity and without judgement. Observe my thoughts, feelings, and actions. And realize that I am NOT my feelings. Being able to separate myself from the outside world was the greatest self discovery I could ask for.\n\nSo take a look at what triggers or annoys you, and then ask yourself \u201CWhere in my life am I doing this action?\u201D And then look with curiosity and without judgement. \n\n#selflove #findyourself #pandemic2020 #selfgrowth #balance #justenough #personalgrowthanddevelopment #mindsetmatters #mindset #loveyourself #positivemindset #chooseyourlife #selfhealer #nurse #nursing #nurses #nursehealers","NumberOfLikes":7,"Hashtags":["#selflove","#findyourself","#pandemic2020","#selfgrowth","#balance","#justenough","#personalgrowthanddevelopment","#mindsetmatters","#mindset","#loveyourself","#positivemindset","#chooseyourlife","#selfhealer","#nurse","#nursing","#nurses","#nursehealers"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Erin | BSN | RN on August 11, 2020.

The heat transfer will be very difficult and the body temperature will rise. \u2060\n\u2060\n😷 Don\u2019t wear masks made of dark or black material. Black material heats up faster and it will cause problems with breath and body temperature. \u2060\n\u2060\n😷 Go for simple medical masks. They are light and they can protect you as well as any other masks. They are more convenient to wear when it\u2019s hot. You may not enjoy them, but this is the best option for summer.

The suddenness of the announcement and the stringency of the lockdown were thoughtless and insensitive,\u201D Singh said.\n\nThe former prime minister also laid out three steps he believed can restore economic normalcy in the coming years. According to Singh, the government must \u201Censure people\u2019s livelihoods are protected and they have spending power through significant direct cash assistance\u201D. The Centre must also make adequate capital available for businesses through \u201Cgovernment-backed credit guarantee programmes\u201D.

Only people who have gone through this last year will know what actually happened lol. My shirt is another one of those statements that most can say \u201Ctotally relatable\u201D hahaha. Since we are on the topic I went ahead and linked some really funny shirts and items I\u2019m sure will be relatable for you;) This week is back to school week for us and many others. Whether it be in person or online. I know some have already been back in school for a week or so now. My theory is that when life has you down, make a shirt about it. Wear that shirt instead of letting it wear you. When life throws you lemons make some Damn good lemonade.\nSometimes it will be bitter but if you add some sugar it will make it sweeter.\nThis past year is a prime example of life giving us lemons. Some have chosen to make super bitter lemonade while others have chosen to add sweetener. For us it\u2019s been one of the most challenging years yet. It\u2019s also been one of the best years yet. We have grown in ways I didn\u2019t even know was possible. While I know we all joke about wanting it to stop and asked ourselves \u201Cwhat in the actual hell is going on?\u201D Have you asked yourself what was good about this year? Just for the record in this situation \u201Cgood\u201D doesn\u2019t mean things went great, it means what great things came from the \u201Cbad.\u201D This is a question that goes through my head a lot. While I know it\u2019s challenging to see the light at the end of the tunnel, it\u2019s important to see the glimmers of hope.\nLet\u2019s be real, if we only see darkness and don\u2019t allow ourselves to see the little bit of light, we will never find our way out. So ask yourself today...\u201DWhat did I get from 2020 that was a blessing in disguise?\u201D Have a great day! \nY\u2019all have to go check out the shirts I linked. They are good lol!

There is no perfect way to work through it.  Truly. \n\nYou are wading through the heaviness, the fear, the uncertainty, and the messiness. \n\nWe know it\u2019s hard, but try not to convince yourself that your exact current struggle and pain will last an entire lifetime. \n\nIt\u2019s not pretty. It\u2019s not easy, but it is always worth it to allow yourself the space and grace to have an honest conversation with yourself about how you are coping right now. \n\nAre you using alcohol more? Is your sleep unpredictable? Have you lost interest in things that used to make you happy? Are you having panic attacks? Have you experienced appetite changes? Biting everyone\u2019s heads off over a dirty towel on the floor? Experiencing memories from your past that you thought were laid to rest? \n\nThese are all signs that 1) you are human 2) that it\u2019s most likely time to link up with a professional counselor\/therapist. \n\nMany people are reaching out for help right now. \n\nYou have an important place on this earth and in people\u2019s lives. \n\nThere is help available. You don\u2019t have to hold on and wait for the storm to pass alone. \n\nYou may have learned how to do this in the past.

This is a community that is invested heavily in the tourism trade, despite its relatively remote location. Like other tourist destinations, Victoria reacted swiftly during the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic, recognizing the economic threat that loomed on the horizon. Gone are its massive cruise ships and international passengers; instead, the city is catering to local and regional Canadians seeking a homegrown experience rather than travelling abroad. \n\nTo improve social distancing, Government Street in Victoria's Old Town district has been closed to vehicle traffic, creating a new pedestrian mall that has seen cafés and restaurants spill into the street for safer al fresco dining. Tourist shops have devoted space to selling groceries and everyday essentials for locals and visitors, reducing the need to travel to larger supermarkets. The end result is a walkable, community-focused city that has some local officials pondering which changes can be made permanent beyond 2020. Although British Columbia was an early COVID-19 hotspot in Canada, diligent social distancing measures, hand washing and frequent mask usage have led to a dramatic drop in new cases - promising a swifter return to normalcy for this idyllic province.\n\nThis is the final part of our series that features Canadian communities from coast-to-coast-to-coast, highlighting their unique pandemic experiences.\n\nPhoto: Victoria, British Columbia\nCredit: Jasper Garratt\n\n#covid19 #covid #coronavirus #virus #pandemic #quarantine #quarantinelife #canada #transcanada #pandemic2020 #2020 #bc #britishcolumbia #victoria #victoriabc #yyj #vancouverisland #chinatown #urbanphotography #urban #oldtown #alley #canadian #street #streetphotography #citylife #cityphotography #cityscape #city #tourism","NumberOfLikes":19,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#covid","#coronavirus","#virus","#pandemic","#quarantine","#quarantinelife","#canada","#transcanada","#pandemic2020","#2020","#bc","#britishcolumbia","#victoria","#victoriabc","#yyj","#vancouverisland","#chinatown","#urbanphotography","#urban","#oldtown","#alley","#canadian","#street","#streetphotography","#citylife","#cityphotography","#cityscape","#city","#tourism"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Respondkits on August 10, 2020.

I was a little overwhelmed thinking about all the amazing family hikes we have completed but then as I scrolled my photos this series of photos came up. These photos were take on the first weekend of summer after months of our  family being separated by the pandemic. We came back together in the Adirondacks and spent the day together exploring lower Saranac Lake, fishing, swimming and exploring one island after another. Three generations of our family came together in these beautiful mountains and we were more grateful than ever to be united in the mountains we love. This truly was my favorite outdoor adventure as it reminded me of all I have to be thankful for. #bestoutdooradventure","NumberOfLikes":157,"Hashtags":["#bestoutdooradventure"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1597111417,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 11 04:03:37 CEST 2020","Location":"Lower Saranac Lake"},{"Owner":"vozesemluto","CaptionText":"Repost @paulameninato\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nFairmount\n\nAnimal testing won\u2019t solve the problems we create.

And selfish was bad. And I didn\u2019t want to be bad, so I did my best to put others\u2019 preferences first.\n.\nConversely, I\u2019ve spent the last 48 hours quietly asking myself the question \u201CJen, what do YOU want right now?\u201D It\u2019s caught me off guard as a surprisingly adventurous and exciting question! 🤗\n.\n\u201CWhat snack do YOU want at the gas station? What time do YOU want to get up in the morning? Rest day or lift day, what is YOUR body telling you, YOU need? What appetizer are YOU going to jump for joy over? Nap or pool? Hike or read?\u201D\n.\nIt feels remarkably odd, and it\u2019s ok... the  fact that I\u2019ve spent the majority of my life gladly (in these very small ways) asking others what they want first. Because if they\u2019re happy, THEN I can be happy. And there\u2019s some truth to that. Service and sacrifice are remarkable acts of love, which is why this practice of self-centerdness can be challenging to sift through. How do I balance self-love and love for others?! \n.\nNow, don\u2019t get me wrong. I am not a cheerleader for narcissists, or a fan of egomaniacs. Selfish, in this context can be bad. Very bad. Yet I know that these times have shown us one thing; we must take care of ourselves. And sometimes we must take care of ourselves FIRST.\n.\nHaving a newborn three times over taught me that. I literally couldn\u2019t feed my babes if I didn\u2019t rest, drink water and eat enough. I had to be first, to also put my daughters first.\n.\nHear this. When we are honest with what we want and need... and align with the brightest truth of who we are, we are personally most fulfilled. I also happen to believe we become a piece to this societal puzzle, that\u2019s necessary to progress us forward. And last but not least, the truth is, we are also a blessing to others. That is not selfish. It\u2019s beautiful and brave. Quietly (or loudly) ask yourself what YOU want (even if it\u2019s just occasionally). Show yo self some self love! You\u2019ll be better off, and so will everyone in your world. \n.\nIn case you\u2019re curious. Cheddar rice cakes and peppered beef jerky. Rest day. Nap AND pool ... at the same time. Hike.

Many jobs have been lost, and food and water have become scarce, and almost unaffordable.\n\nBased on available data, some 24 million people in Yemen , almost 80% of the population are struggling with hunger and starvation and in need of immediate humanitarian assistance. \n\n\"\u2018Yemen - Hanging on by a thread\", said  UN chief requesting funding to meet staggering humanitarian crisis\nThis warning came after the UN plan for the humanitarian package fell short which could lead to a cutdown in the aid package.\n\nMany NGOs and non-profit organizations are collecting donations and doing all that they can to help avoid a huge humanitarian disaster in that part of the globe. We offer our deepest appreciation and gratitude for them and would like to join hands to support them.👋🙏🙏\n\nIf you are eager to help and would like to explore options, @globalgiving makes it transparent and easy. \nLearn more here: https:\/\/rb.gy\/kg03a\n#storiesfromthefrontlines #humanitarian","NumberOfLikes":92,"Hashtags":["#storiesfromthefrontlines","#humanitarian"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Stories from the Frontlines on August 10, 2020 tagging @unitednations, @globalgiving, @globalgivingmedia, and @storiesfromthefrontlines.

I will attach the flyer. \ngenesis garcia lezama is inviting you to a scheduled Zoom meeting.\n\nTopic: COVID19 and The Way It's Affecting PWD Access to Health Care\nTime: Aug 21, 2020 11:00 AM Central Time (US and Canada)\n\nJoin Zoom Meeting\nhttps:\/\/zoom.us\/j\/98426781158\n\nMeeting ID: 984 2678 1158\nOne tap mobile\n+13462487799,,98426781158# US (Houston)\n+12532158782,,98426781158# US (Tacoma)\n\nDial by your location\n +1 346 248 7799 US (Houston)\n +1 253 215 8782 US (Tacoma)\n +1 669 900 6833 US (San Jose)\n +1 312 626 6799 US (Chicago)\n +1 929 436 2866 US (New York)\n +1 301 715 8592 US (Germantown)\nMeeting ID: 984 2678 1158\nFind your local number: https:\/\/zoom.us\/u\/abf33nxT52","NumberOfLikes":9,"Hashtags":[],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Génesis GL (she\/her\/ella) in McAllen, Texas.

Mars in Aries square to Pluto in Capricorn. I\u2019m going keep talking about this theme for the whole month. Mars = the body, action, how we FIGHT for and with people. Pluto = death and rebirth, wealth, shadow, the underworld, power, control, compulsion. If you\u2019ve been paying attention you\u2019ll remember that squares are areas of tension in astrology.  We have reached a face off between Mars and Pluto. The moon in Taurus today also adds stubbornness and resistance to change. If you feel resistant to engaging with your shadow or if you feel overwhelmed by the task of it, how can you transform that energy? You are never without agency unless you allow that.

It struck me that it sat in the same spot for days in a row. I don't think it ever moved. I tried to feed it at the Pantai but it did not eat. Considering that it was unusually cold at night maybe down to 20°C at times I wondered how it would keep warm being so tiny.\n\nFinally I decided to take it back with me as I couldn't stand the thought anymore how it sat there alone, hungry and most likely cold.\nIt also cried a lot. \n\nEven if it would not live it was better to have it die in some comfort. \n\nSo I gave it the name Francis - a name that applies to both genders not knowing if it was female or male - and named it after 'Francis of Assisi' as he would have taken care of it. 🤍🕊️\n\nIt felt quite happy in the box with the towel and some company. \n\nBut it died peacefully in its sleep the next morning about the same time as Lemon.\n \nI did contemplate on the timing and thought it appeared maybe just to be a travel companion for Lemon for his last passage. \nHow long it survived! \n\nR.I.P. ✝️ little kitten ❤️🕊️\n\nTuesday, 4th August 2020\nWednesday, 5th August 2020\n\n#lonekitten #cats #kitten #pantaijasi #jasribeach #jasri #allmyanimals#myjourneytotheeast #myjourney #karangasem #eastbali #bali\n#theneverendingstory #covid19 #pandemic2020 #thedodo","NumberOfLikes":23,"Hashtags":["#lonekitten","#cats","#kitten","#pantaijasi","#jasribeach","#jasri","#allmyanimal","#myjourneytotheeast","#myjourney","#karangasem","#eastbali","#bali","#theneverendingstory","#covid19","#pandemic2020","#thedodo"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1597081960,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 10 19:52:40 CEST 2020","Location":"Pantai Jasri"},{"Owner":"sarcasmboutique","CaptionText":"This #maskne needs the boot🌋 #pandemic2020 #mypoorskin #maskacne #workselfie #bartenderchronicles #nyxeyeshadow #hotpinkeyeshadow #nyxmascara #kabrowbenefit #jadeeyes","NumberOfLikes":14,"Hashtags":["#maskne","#pandemic2020","#mypoorskin","#maskacne","#workselfie","#bartenderchronicles","#nyxeyeshadow","#hotpinkeyeshadow","#nyxmascara","#kabrowbenefit","#jadeeyes"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Elizabeth Keen on August 10, 2020.

I hope you all are doing well. Let\u2019s welcome Monday with this thought provoking quote. \u2063\n\u2063\nFor real we don\u2019t need that much, we think we need. This pandemic proved it strongly. Whatever, we have sitting in our closets and our cars are parked in garages. We have to understand that we can spend our life with less too and be happy. \u2063\n\u2063\nOnce this pandemic is over, let\u2019s decide to have ONLY whatever we need and don\u2019t waste our money on these materialistic things.\u2063\n\u2063\nI am not saying that we won\u2019t need to spend on ourselves. That\u2019s our right to look and feel good, but just need to keep in mind that less is better and we don\u2019t need things to be happy, instead we need people around us to make us happy. \u2063\n\u2063\nWhat do you think.

It has been very painful at times, as I realized that this business was not only my baby but it was the only place in the world that I truly felt I belonged. Thanks to the sacred pause from covid I was able to hear my Soul\u2019s longing to remember that I belong here whether or not I have this business.\n\u2009\nThis has led me to a deep state of surrender where I allowed myself to totally collapse. For the first time since I started my business 11 years ago I let go completely. I couldn\u2019t make a public announcement for 3 months - unable to come forth clearly while navigating the complex logistics led me to sit in stillness and to access that level of Truth which can only be heard in silence. Being quarantined in Panama granted me a inpouring of messages from my ancestors\/Spirit\/nature in her many forms. Strongest of all, the ocean - who\u2019s ever changing tides carry so much wisdom. \u2009\n\u2009\nSo, while this is not the way I ever thought this would happen I close the doors to this space with deep gratitude. I release control and trust life is leading me to to knowing and loving myself beyond this role I\u2019ve had the privilege to play. I\u2019ll continue to share healing, facilitate community, and create sacred space. The energy we created in this place will continue on in me and in those it touched. \u2009\n\u2009\nI have so much more to share - but for now check out the farewell video that includes my message to the community and words from 11 of the staff from over the years - 1 for every year we were in business, on the @peaceofmindsacredwellness page. \u2009\n\u2009\nAnd yes, I\u2019m gonna come back to say goodbye to you Colorado - in Sept. Come bid me farewell as I leap into the unknown. It took a leap of faith to start this business when I was 22 and it\u2019s taking a leap of faith now to close it. If the success of this business has taught me anything it\u2019s been to follow my 💚thank you to all who made this dream possible.","NumberOfLikes":359,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Being the Medicine in Bocas del Toro, Panama.

A comunidade cientifica ainda não confirmou que casos de reinfecção possam acontecer nessas situação. Porém, ainda devido a falta de conhecimento sobre alguns aspectos da doença, infectologistas afirmam que é preciso estar atento para avaliar essa possivel reinfecção.\n\nHá centenas de casos de reinfecção confirmados pelas autoridades de saúde da Coreia do Sul, em abril, mas, após cuidadosa avaliação, concluíram que esses casos de reinfecção seria provavelmente resultado de fragmentos inativos do vírus, ainda presente nos pacientes.\n\nCasos isolados de possível reinfecção que aparecem no território brasileiro podem ser explicados através de diferentes motivos ou causas. Uma delas é que, após a infecção sintomatica do COVID, esse paciente não tenha se recuperado totalmente, não apresentando sintomas e, após certo tempo, possivelmente devido a imunidade, esses sintomas novamente retorne. \n\nOutra causa é a assertividade dos testes realizados, podendo ser apresentado tanto falso negativo quanto falso positivo. Nesse caso, poderia ser melhor explicado se o sistema imune do paciente mantem o vírus a níveis que impeçam os testes de identifica-lo. Dessa forma, pode-se ter uma alteração no resultado do teste. \n\nPorém é ainda necessário aguardar melhores definições da comunidade cientifica e médica, já que os coronavírus de resfriados comuns podem provocar uma memória curta de defesa do organimo. Essa memória curta está associada a produção de anticorpos por apenas 6 a 12 meses subsequentes. Como o vírus #sarscov2 também é um coronavírus, a possibilidade de reinfecção poderá ocorrer nesse período de tempo, porém não confirmado ainda por dados clinicos e estatisticos confiáveis. \n\n🧬🧪👩\u200D⚕️👩\u200D🔬\n#pandemia #pandemic2020 #nanochemtechsolutions #nanochemtech #healthy #healthtech #startup #healthtechstartup","NumberOfLikes":19,"Hashtags":["#sarscov2","#covid19.","#sarscov2","#pandemia","#pandemic2020","#nanochemtechsolutions","#nanochemtech","#healthy","#healthtech","#startup","#healthtechstartup"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1597072235,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 10 17:10:35 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"ty.heo.22","CaptionText":"#selfie #pandemic2020 #wearamask #weareinthistogether #blackandwhite","NumberOfLikes":0,"Hashtags":["#selfie","#pandemic2020","#wearamask","#weareinthistogether","#blackandwhite"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Travel-Food-Love on August 10, 2020.

So now both @marshallsamson and I have 100 rides under our belt on our #pandemic2020 splurge purchase from @onepeloton\n.\nAs some folks may know, I used to teach dance fitness.  I loved every second of it, and while I taught for the love of it - I also taught so that women could see someone on stage who looked like they did.  At my smallest I was about a size 12 and I got there from two-a-day workouts and disordered eating (don't do that). But even then I was one of the larger instructors bopping about #zincon. \n.\nWhen I stopped teaching I've had a hot and cold relationship with fitness.  Gyms, bootcamp, weights, diets, meds - you name it I've tried it. My Peloton is the first thing that I've been excited about when it comes to fitness in a long time, and the companies mission and advocacy is pretty amazing to boot!\n.\nTL;DR:  I say this all to make sure folks know that normal people can engage in fitness -- heck normal sized folks can even lead fitness classes(!). But most inportantly fitness is for everyone no matter what you see, no matter what the ads tell you, and sometimes your body simply does what it does.  Mine will never be a size 6 🤷🏾\u200D♀️ I just have to give that up.  But my body can be strong and healthy, it can lead the hard songs in dance fitness classes it can lift heavy things,, it can cycle the hard rides.
