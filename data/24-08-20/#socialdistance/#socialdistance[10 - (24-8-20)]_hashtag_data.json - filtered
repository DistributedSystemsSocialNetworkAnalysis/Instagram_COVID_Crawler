Today, we are trying out some new new, that just opened across the street from us in Kerns district, where Stoopid Burger used to be. Rollin Fresh, already has three food carts but this is their first brick and mortar. I got the Fresh Prince: Deep fried with Salmon, Tempura Shrimp, Cream cheese, Crab and Ginger Guac. As well as the Soft Shell Crab. Carl got the Bridgetown: A Deep Fried Crab, Spicy Tuna, Shrimp, and Cream Cheese (not pictured). The flavors were amazing, portions were generous and it really curbed our sushi cravings. This was a perfect summer date night! They have a huge open patio area, some of the very few I would ever choose to dine at, as well as food to go, which we chose to do bc were introverts who love sitting on our couch at home.

A chance for unabashed lash volume that is. Once we\u2019re allowed to reopen you can look forward to trying our new Novalash London Volume set with Stacy. What makes London lashes stand out from the crowd, here\u2019s a few reasons: \n\n* \tLashes are oil-proof and instantly waterproof\n* \tThis unique technique allows lashes to look thick and full even as they shed\n* \tInfills are needed every 4-5 weeks (depending on growth cycle, age, medication and activity, infills might be needed every 3 weeks)\n* \tLondon Volume extensions are safe to wear even though the look is more full, dense, and dramatic than American Volume. This is due to the use of thinner diameter extensions, which create lighter fans.\n\nWith less weight than standard volume lashes, you get all of the drama without sacrificing that natural feel.  After all, you didn\u2019t just get these Look-at-me lashes not to flutter them did you? \n\n#saferathome #covid19 #novalash #spa #stacylashandskin #dramatic #lashes #lashextensions #lashlove #facials #waxing #skincare #bodytreatment #rona #novalashcertified\n#londonvolume #naturallashes #hybridlashes #volumelashes #reopening #wearamask #socialdistance #washyourhands #safetyprotocols #lashfills #lashpro #lashartist #unitedtogether #flattenthecurve #safetyfirst","NumberOfLikes":13,"Hashtags":["#saferathome","#covid19","#novalash","#spa","#stacylashandskin","#dramatic","#lashes","#lashextensions","#lashlove","#facials","#waxing","#skincare","#bodytreatment","#rona","#novalashcertified","#londonvolume","#naturallashes","#hybridlashes","#volumelashes","#reopening","#wearamask","#socialdistance","#washyourhands","#safetyprotocols","#lashfills","#lashpro","#lashartist","#unitedtogether","#flattenthecurve","#safetyfirst"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Stacy Lash & Skin in Stacy Lash and Skin.

Und der müssen wir uns stellen. So wie THYRA SCHMIDT, bildende Künstlerin. In ihren Arbeiten verbindet sie fotografische und filmische Mittel mit überwiegend selbst verfassten Texten und konzipiert daraus Installationen im Innen- und Außenraum.\n\nMeine Fragen entnehme ich Ihrer 2012 entstandenen Video-Arbeit \u2019Du in meinem Leben oder irgendwo in \u2026\u2018: Kann man zu sehr lieben? Kann man zu lange lieben? Gäbe es genügend Liebe, dann gäbe es wohl keinen exzessiven Kapitalismus, keine Umweltzerstörung und keine Kriege. Liebe ist Zuneigung; und wenn ich jemanden oder etwas liebe, gehe ich doch achtsam und verantwortungsbewusst mit ihr, ihm, den Wesen und Dingen um.\n\nDie Hasser im digitalen Netz sind erbarmungslos: wie groß ist die Macht der Worte? Es dreht sich alles um die Macht der Bilder, denke ich. Um Bilder ohne Worte und um Bilder durch Worte: ohne Worte sind sie universeller, sprachübergreifend lesbar; in Form von Worten können sie vielleicht präziser ins Innerste zielen und treffen. In meinen künstlerischen Arbeiten versuche ich, mit wenigen Worten Momente zwischenmenschlicher Begebenheiten einzufangen \u2013 ähnlich eines fotografischen Schnappschusses: eine prägnante Situation oder Atmosphäre, Emotionen oder auch Statements. Mein eigenes Leben dient mir als Fundgrube elementarer Ereignisse, denen ich nachspüre und aus verschiedenen Perspektiven begegne. So entstehen gedankliche Räume, die man durchqueren kann. Auch verschiedene Zeiträume, die nacheinander oder nebeneinander ablaufen können. Nähe und Dauer erhalten eine besondere Qualität: zu lange lieben kann man nicht!","NumberOfLikes":33,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Hartmut S.

It really means a lot to me so I hope you read til the end. \n\r\nIt started with a quarantine creation back in March lock down. The seed was planted and has been growing ever since.  I chose hunger as the cause because I'm passionate about it, and hunger is a global pandemic just like Covid is. While there are many wonderful organizations out there, I specifically chose to donate to @mealsonwheelsamerica because of their incredible mission,  which not only provides food to the eldery \/poor\/veterans but adds a social element of companionship as well. Since Elderly are high risk, most have been pretty isolated from their families and their community. Each meal that is delivered comes with a personal visit that they can look fwd to💕\n\r\n The only certain thing during such unprecedented times is the uncertainty. It's safe to say we are all enduring the same storm on very different boats. Each human experience is different than that of the next, and we all view this craziness thru a different lens. I hope we can all agree it's time to help heal humanity, even if that's just one meal or person at a time.\n\r\nThere are multiple intentions\/symbolisms in this pandemic piece, which I'll briefly explain and you can interpret the rest. \r\nEach piece of Jasper (you can read the incredibly healing properties by swiping➡️) is one of a kind, and represents different parts of the earth, the globe, humanity etc. The smaller piece is at least 6 chain links apart from the main piece, representing social distancing (and in some cases isolation). Ultimately, the integrity of the chain\/necklace depends on all parts!\n\r\nHere's how it works:\r\nI will donate $10 per necklace to Meals on Wheels. Theres 40 pieces of Jasper so my end goal is to donate $400!! That's a lot of meals\/visits! Another special aspect is you can customize your necklace by choosing your piece from the numbered slide and then either copper chain ($45) or sterling silver $55-60 (I have 2 size chain\/clasp options).\n\r\nThats it!  Thanks for reading. Im passionate about this project! \n\n#jewelryforacause #healinghumanity","NumberOfLikes":30,"Hashtags":["#jewelryforacause","#healinghumanity"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":28,"Timestamp":1596225168,"LocalDate":"Fri Jul 31 21:52:48 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"lockdownmagicathome","CaptionText":"Even though you want to try to, never grow up - Peter Pan.","NumberOfLikes":20,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1596225156,"LocalDate":"Fri Jul 31 21:52:36 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"resolutiondance","CaptionText":"🧡💛🧡 \n\nWow and that's that, today the end of our 3rd month of taking our #Dance and #Cheerleading classes online!

This is my first post, a #ghibiliredraw that I initially shared on my personal insta. \u201CPrincess MononoGwen\u201D was my first time using @autodesksketchbook on my iPad Mini 4 with the @53pencil . I wasn\u2019t completely confident in the app at the time, so I stuck to the basic pen and airbrush option set in the app. That said, despite not using the most up to date tech, I think its pretty good. Autodesk Sketchbook is a great FREE app. Maybe not as robust as Photoshop or Procreate, but I think its perfect for someone just kind of getting a feel for drawing digitally. Its a simple, friendly UI experience. Using the texture shapes on both the suit and the background really works bring it all together. I really like how vibrant it is despite there being so much black. All and all, now a bad way to go for my first go in a few years. Next week\u2019s illustration will certainly be a bit more topical, but You\u2019ll see a particular theme in most if these initial pieces very quickly. \n\nCheers!!\n\n#digitalart #appleipad #ipadmini4 #53pencil #autodesksketchbook #comicart #artstudy #kaiju #mecha #nsfw #greyscale #funtimes #covid19 #quarantine #wearamask #staysafe #socialdistance #everyfriday #hopefully #redraw #spiderman #spidergwen #hayaomiyazaki #princessmononoke #studioghibli #intothespiderversefanart #intothespiderverse #wassupdanger #procreate","NumberOfLikes":4,"Hashtags":["#ghibiliredraw","#digitalart","#appleipad","#ipadmini4","#53pencil","#autodesksketchbook","#comicart","#artstudy","#kaiju","#mecha","#nsfw","#greyscale","#funtimes","#covid19","#quarantine","#wearamask","#staysafe","#socialdistance","#everyfriday","#hopefully","#redraw","#spiderman","#spidergwen","#hayaomiyazaki","#princessmononoke","#studioghibli","#intothespiderversefanart","#intothespiderverse","#wassupdanger","#procreate"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1596218989,"LocalDate":"Fri Jul 31 20:09:49 CEST 2020","Location":"Quarantine Zone"},{"Owner":"rabbitrabbittea_seattle","CaptionText":"Japanese Buckwheat(Caffeine free) & \nThai Milk Tea\n📣Soft opening, Buy one get one free➡️ 7\/29 ~7\/31\n🕰12PM~6PM\n\n#rabbitrabbittea #rabbitrabbitteaseattle #boba #bobatea  #mailktea  #tapioca  #bobatime #drinks #rrtsea #opening #queenanne #seattle #summerdrinks #socialdistance #seattle","NumberOfLikes":1,"Hashtags":["#rabbitrabbittea","#rabbitrabbitteaseattle","#boba","#bobatea","#mailktea","#tapioca","#bobatime","#drinks","#rrtsea","#opening","#queenanne","#seattle","#summerdrinks","#socialdistance","#seattle"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Rabbit Rabbit Tea Seattle on July 31, 2020.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1596218987,"LocalDate":"Fri Jul 31 20:09:47 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"a.n.d.made","CaptionText":"Social Distancing Cacti.

I am getting ready for another week of weddings. Which is very exciting to me. A year ago I would have never thought that my tiny business would have made in a difference in my life, let alone someone else's! I always honored when someone picks me to be a part of their special day! As we are looking at another impending shut down in this area, I want to remind you all I am still offering my pandemic special, which covers ceremony design meetings, ceremony rehearsal, a live stream of your wedding for friends and family who can not be in attendance, pictures to remember your special day, gas mileage, a gift from the officiant, and a donation to the Alzheimers Association! For this month we also sent funds to the Thrugood Marshall College Fund. This month we will be donating to the Pathway Connect Program. This program provides college level starter level courses in 150 countries. For just $7.50 someone in in Venezuela can get 3 semesters of college credit education! I have never been a good student and I just finished this program with A\u2019s! I can't wait to take the knowledge I have gained with me into my next realm of education! I believe that everyone deserves a fair chance at education and this program is a good place to start! Education stimulates the brain. Brain stimulation can keep dementia symptoms at bay. So who knew that education was so vitally important. Knowledge is power so arm yourself with it! So if you're looking for a quick ceremony text me, Book me now from here or at unforgettablemomentsofficiants.com! Be kind and wear a mask everyone.

A series exploring the personal impact of quarantine. Virtual shoot. 5\/31\/2020.\n.\n\"So I looked up 'ennui'. I came across some sentiments I\u2019ve become particularly familiar with during this event. Unfulfilled (yup). Listlessness (oh yeah). Lassitude (had to look that one up, but also yes). A personal favorite: one of \u201Cthe blahs\u201D. I even read that the English word \u201Cannoy\u201D is derived from \u201Cennui\u201D, which seems pretty apropos. \u2060\n\u2060\nDuring my search, I came across another new term: \u201CWeltschmerz\u201D. A German word for \u201Cworld pain\u201D. A weariness that stems from a disconnect between your idealized image of the world and reality. An extrospective sadness informed by global circumstance and the inability to personally enact overwhelming positive change. \u2060\n\u2060\nI like that we can feel Weltschmerz. A pain for others.
