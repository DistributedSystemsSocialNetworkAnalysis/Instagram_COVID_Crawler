It seems like the world has only one thing on their mind: CORONAVIRUS!!! \n\nHere are some reminders while youre at home -- try not to pick your nose. Snot and boogers can spread germs 👾👾 that carry coronavirus. When someone coughs or sneezes it lands on door handles, tables, iphones and pencils. Even sandwiches 🥪🌭. The germs can stick there for a few days. If you stand too close to somebody, who coughs or sneezes 🤧🤧, you might breathe it in. They're so small you cant even see them. Make sure to keep your distance (about 2 kid moko jumbie sticks away ~6ft). And wash your hands a lot, a lot. With soap and bubbles or hand sanitizer. \n\nYou might need to spend a lot of time around your home to avoid spreading the virus. If you go outside, wear your mask 😷😷 as much as possible. Over your nose and mouth, not upside down or inside out. Or even your friend's mask. Thats gross.\n\nDo go outside and play. If you have stilts, walk tall. If you have a bike, ride like the wind. Most of all, keep being brave. Keep being a kid. Lets all work together to protect one another, especially our grandparents. #StopCovid #WearMasks #WashHands #SocialDistance \n\n💛🌟\n\n#1000mokos","NumberOfLikes":76,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597711134,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 18 02:38:54 CEST 2020","Location":"Arouca, Trinidad and Tobago"},{"CaptionText":"I will take everything. \n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n#repost #quarantine #al #alabama #quarantineandchill #quarantinelife #quarantined #quarantine2020 #quarantinememes #quarantinememe #lockdown #socialdistance #coronamemes #coronavirus #coronavirusmeme #coronavirusmemes #covid_19 #covıd19 #covid #covidmemes #covid19memes #relatablememes","NumberOfLikes":4,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597711118,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 18 02:38:38 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Me and the boys when we\u2019re stuck in quarantine...\n ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n#repost #quarantine #georgia #ga #quarantineandchill #quarantinelife #quarantined #quarantine2020 #quarantinememes #quarantinememe #lockdown #socialdistance #coronamemes #coronavirus #coronavirusmeme #coronavirusmemes #coronavirusmemes #covid_19 #covıd19 #covid #covidmemes #covid19memes #relatablememes","NumberOfLikes":0,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597709842,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 18 02:17:22 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Taking #predictions and #Psychics over here....❓","NumberOfLikes":44,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Brookie\u2019s Cookies NYC in New York, New York.

I was so excited to see the students, but I was so unsure as to how it was going to go. I followed my morning routine and got ready to go. \n\nWhen I got in my car I turned on the Christian radio station and just prayed.\n\nI prayed for the students who were scared to walk to their classrooms alone.\n\nI prayed for the teachers who have so much on their plates. The ones who are hoping they don\u2019t bring the sickness back to their families. The ones who worked so hard to plan for a first day like no other. \n\nI prayed for the parents who couldn\u2019t walk their children to their classroom. The ones who have students starting at a brand new school and don\u2019t know anyone. The ones who hope they made the right decision to send their students to school or to keep them home.\n\nI prayed for the principals. The ones who have worked tirelessly to form a plan to serve ALL students. The ones who didn\u2019t sleep at all the night before wondering what would go wrong on that first day. The ones who no matter the decision have to deal with parents who aren\u2019t happy with any decision. \n\nI prayed for our school board leaders. The ones who had to make the plan on how to get students back to school. The ones who worry that their plan might not work. \n\nI prayed and prayed. For the most part I believe the prayers worked. I saw students\u2019 eye light up. I know they were smiling under that mask. The leaders just rolled with whatever was thrown at them and stayed calm. \n\nIt was definitely a \u201Cdifferent\u201D start to the school year. But I am so happy to be getting back to \u201CS\u2019more learning at MES\u201D\n\n#backtoschool #elementaryschool #elementarymusic #smorelearning #iteachtoo #musiconacart #fitteacher #education #forthekids #backtoschool2020 #outofquarantine #wearthemask #socialdistance","NumberOfLikes":61,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597698396,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 23:06:36 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#socialdistance #stillwalking #standback6feet #sciencematters","NumberOfLikes":20,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":7,"Timestamp":1597698046,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 23:00:46 CEST 2020","Location":"Beaverdam Reservoir"},{"CaptionText":"Your car\u2019s indoor air needs to be purified and clean.\nOrder today by visiting www.mkme.store\n#covid19 #coronavirus #socialdistance #corona #infraredthermometer #facemask #mask #dustmask #notouch #sterilizer #handsanitizer #handsanitize #sanitizingbox #disinfection #airpurifier #ionizer #antimicrobial #cardeodorizer #UVlight #phonecleaner #oxygen #filter #facemaskfilter #filteredmask #staysafe #quarantine #pandemic #healthy #MKMEstore","NumberOfLikes":6,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by MKMEssentials on August 17, 2020.

JOIN US NEXT TIME ! This isn\u2019t my first time cleaning up the beach, but I wanted to paint a picture in your heads what\u2019s been going on in our beaches. It was really sad what I found in the first 30 minutes of being there. When I was younger the beaches used to be so much more clean, I used to be there every day and now I come back to the beaches as an adult and see how trashed it is. Fellow stoners are even leaving their trash. At first I just thought it was lazy people and leaving their kids toys behind. Then I started finding pairs of shoes, then capsules, foil wrappers, torches, lighters, and even multiple syringes. Not only is this not safe for us to walk around but the future generation, there were so many kids playing in the sand with no shoes of course, and that\u2019s where I found the most syringes which was very scary. If you\u2019re not coming to help clean please do your part and clean up your trash. Most the time the trash cans are right there before you get back to your car. Make it a habit.

This is one slide of 5 that is a succinct snap shot of a current ideals. \n.\nI\u2019ve always been inspired by chef kinch, unfortunately from a distance, but there are just things that he\u2019s said that have stuck with me. From @chefpodcast he said \u201Cit\u2019s our job to make them better cooks than we were.\u201D That idea of passing along knowledge and encouragement is amazing. Too many chefs think it\u2019s about their egos and earning the right to put someone down. I want to treat my cooks better than I was. I want to inspire them. And when I\u2019m old and frail and out of the game, to see that they are bringing on the next generation. \n.\nIn this recent post, he also speaks of not referring to the pre-Covid times as the \u201Cgolden age\u201D but the \u201Cgilded age\u201D. There is the proof on the plate of ornate over substance, but he speaks also of business practices and labour. That ornate plate comes at a cost and that is usually on the backs of the staff or stages. \n.\nThe @thecountycanteen adapted when we opened phase 3. We switched to an as environmentally conscious disposable plating, cutlery and glass ware for the protection of the staff. Would you want to be handling a strangers fork they have slobbered on or glass with their lipstick amidst a PANDEMIC? Unfortunately one google review was not happy with these choices. Fuck them. Our food and service are still grand. Classic pre-Covid menu items are still cooked with care. So our Wollenburger comes on a tray instead of a plate. Some fucking burger, same great taste. And the new items are the bomb. We have just got our feet down and now working on more dishes. \n.\nFront of house, back of house and the public has to realize we\u2019re in a new game now. We get to decide some of the rules, outside of covid. The staff decides what behaviors will be accepted. Over the last couple years, I\u2019ve been referred to as a kitchen feminist...now Covid has turned up the volume on all my intersectional activism. And public, adapt your expectations and live in the moment. Enjoy what you get to do. Eating out on a tray is better than being on a respirator.\n.\n#wearyourmask #socialdistance #normalizemask #respectyourserver #1k1l #1kitchen1love","NumberOfLikes":18,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Robin Dutt in Picton, Ontario.

Children are taught useless information, to shut up, and follow orders. Their strengths are not nurtured, nor are they educated about how to rationally prepare for the real world, entrepreneurship, investing wisely in themselves, or their community. They are taught flat out lies about humanity, history, sexuality, health, and given zero direction on how to be emotionally mature, interdependent with their community, or sovereign. They are taught being an obedient drone gets you ahead in life, while simultaneously creating unnecessary competition with each other. They are forced into a prison like setting with a rigid schedule meant to break them down. Now they are being exposed to psychological and emotional abuse by wearing a mask all day and social distancing. They are being taught to live in fear of things they can\u2019t see and to fear each other by distancing from one another. Manipulation is at an all time high. What is occurring inside the walls of these child detention centers masquerading as places of education is flat out traumatizing, cruel, and evil. \n #socialdistance #mask #indoctrination #manipulation #abuse #trauma #seperationanxiety #connection #savethechildren #america #2020","NumberOfLikes":14,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Natalie Kay on August 16, 2020.

It\u2019s had it many ups and downs, but for the most part each one has taught me something new about myself. I\u2019m smart and capable of so much I just have to push myself further. In year 22 leading up to 23 I was able to turn my Bestfriend into my boyfriend, move to a whole next state, learn more about him and his family, get our own apartment, save money, slowly but surely getting to open my own business (@noire_royal), learn how to drive not one forklift but two different types(thanks to my amazing mentor\/work mom), become a server, and now being store manager at sneaker\/clothing store, which if you know me you know I love both. All of these things have come to be from manifesting, perseverance, and overcoming my own internal struggles. I\u2019m grateful to have made it to year 23 and excited for many more years to come. Hopefully in year 23 I\u2019m able to complete the goals I\u2019ve set for myself despite this pandemic and inspire others. I\u2019m still working on being more positive and spreading positivity. I appreciate everyone who\u2019s been here helping me and encouraging me along the way. Happy Birthday To Me! 🎂 (P.S. yes it\u2019s a fake Eiffel Tower in North Carolina and yes I was being extra it\u2019s my birthday and yes I know how to wear a mask I have asthma let me live)👑 #leogang #eiffel #socialdistance #happybirthday #queenofblack #noireroyal #jordanyear🎉","NumberOfLikes":98,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by 𝕁𝕒𝕕𝕖 👽🌺♌️ on August 16, 2020.

With the doggos we were not allowed to enter buildings with them but were allowed to switch off and check things out as needed which I don\u2019t mind because the preservation of such a place is much needed. The infamous swallows are not migrating here this time of the year but the butterfly\u2019s and bees were out in full force and enjoying the gardens with us. We used boots when it got warm for the dogs so you\u2019ll notice some pics with boots and some without. The ruins area was like seeing part of the coliseum destroyed. It was a fun day trip for sure. We crossed the street from the mission and ate at a little Italian place afterwards. Then we cruised over to Dana Point and went over to the Strand Beach. Strand Beach is crazy because you have to walk down about ten flights of stairs to get to it.... and no I diddnt even attempt it, it would have ended me for a week at least. There is a rolling elevator but it\u2019s closed thanks to the Rona. Liz and Lonnie ran down and played in the ocean for a few minutes while I walked the dogs on the trail at the top for the righteous view. #sanjuancapistranomission #sanjuancapistrano #fountains #butterflies #bees #servicedogs #servicepoodles #autismsupportdog #dogboots #anxiety #chronicpain #backpain #daytrip #enrichment #history #mentalhealth #mentalwellness #selfcare #summertime #socialdistance #stircrazy #nationalrelaxationday #familytime","NumberOfLikes":60,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1597588833,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 16 16:40:33 CEST 2020","Location":"San Juan Capistrano Misson"},{"CaptionText":"かわゆき自宅警備員\n#黒猫\n#ペルシャ猫\n#茶猫\n#SOCIALDISTANCE","NumberOfLikes":36,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597588782,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 16 16:39:42 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Yaaassss Divas! 💪🏾🖤 #goodmorning #sundaymorning #sundaythoughts #sundayvibes #sundaymood  #sundaymotivation  #sundayfunday #morningmotivation #happysunday #morningthoughts #morningvibes #morningmotivation #motivation #socialdistance #orlandoboutique #onlineboutique #divacouturecollection","NumberOfLikes":19,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by DivaCoutureCollection on August 16, 2020.
