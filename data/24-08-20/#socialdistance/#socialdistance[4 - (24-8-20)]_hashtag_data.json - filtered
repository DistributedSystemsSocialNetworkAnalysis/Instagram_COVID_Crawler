In de media horen we verschillende meningen, die elkaar soms ronduit tegenspreken. Het lijkt soms wel een battle tussen bijvoorbeeld viruswaanzin en het RIVM. Door al die verschillende meningen weten mensen niet meer wat ze moeten geloven. Het gesprek over het coronavirus lijkt zwart-wit, terwijl er juist grote grijze gebieden zijn van dingen die we nog niet zeker weten. Er is gewoon nog veel onzeker, dat is niet prettig, maar voorlopig moeten we met die onzekerheid leven.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nHet is in deze tijd verleidelijk om te roepen dat het kabinet meer maatregelen moet nemen, of juist minder. Sommige mensen worden opstandig en houden zich helemaal niet meer aan de maatregelen, anderen leven juist te veel in angst. Er is minder ruimte voor een open gesprek over dat wat we niet weten. Dat kan weer leiden tot een tunnelvisie en het versterkt het zwart-wit gesprek. \n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nIk wil mensen oproepen om niet naar anderen te wijzen, of zich te laten leiden door \u2018corona-moeheid\u2019, vakantie, recalcitrant gedrag of het zwart-wit gesprekken. Dit is een oproep om eigenaarschap te nemen, allemaal op onze eigen manier verantwoordelijkheid nemen voor onszelf en onze directe omgeving. Want ook al lijkt het misschien niet altijd zo, u heeft ook een deel van de coronacrisis en de gevolgen daarvan in uw hand.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nIn de aankomende posts zal ik bespreken hoe u eigenaarschap kunt nemen. Ik bespreek het belang van risico-inschattingen en zal ik informatie geven om die op een verantwoorde manier te maken.","NumberOfLikes":35,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597564055,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 16 09:47:35 CEST 2020","Location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands"},{"CaptionText":"#l4l #ootd #socialdistance #instagram #vscofilter #1998cam #follow #instafashion #me #japan","NumberOfLikes":52,"Hashtags":["#l4l","#ootd","#socialdistance","#instagram","#vscofilter","#1998cam","#follow","#instafashion","#me","#japan"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by 馬 on August 16, 2020 tagging @pumawomen, and @2100xtokyo.

This is life with a parent in an assisted living facility. This is me, standing 10+ feet behind him just to get a pic. This is not fair. And even tho I\u2019m smiling for him, this is not fun. \n\nBackstory: My daddy had a severe, hemorrhagic stroke 6 years ago (Aug 22, 2014) just one month shy of turning 70. He was active, healthy, living his best retired life doing what he loved best: building things. He was a \u201Cfixer-upper\u201D before it was a thing. 😉 \n\nHe should not have survived. But he did. \n\nHe should not be able to remember things. But he does. \n\nHe should not be able to speak. But he does.\n\nMy sweet mama took him home after 7 weeks in the hospital and vowed to take care of him, help him heal, and be there for as long as it took - no matter what. That\u2019s what you do when you\u2019ve loved a person since you were 14! When you\u2019ve been married since you were 19! When you\u2019ve been married for 50+ years. But after 3.5 years, and multiple moves, it was evident she could not hold out long term.\n\nEnter Assisted Living. We are a family familiar with assisted living via the development\/business side. Such a BLESSING! He is well taken care of, and he is content! Thank you Jesus! But...we have not entered the building or been in close contact with him since mid March!! FIVE months without a hug, a handshake, a high five, a kiss on the cheek, a snuggle, or a conversation in close proximity. We understand the need to protect the vulnerable, all those in these homes. We do! But let me just say it was HARD not to run over and hug my daddy\u2019s neck! And bless my sweet mama....Covid is not easy on married couples in this situation. If you are the praying kind - remember the couples who are in this situation. Not all assisted living or nursing home residents are just old and ready to \u201Cgo home\u201D. Some are still married and miss their spouse\u2019s visits, touch, and closeness.\n\nThis is covid. And there seems to be no end to it. But like my shirt says, we CHOOSE happy for those we love the most!❤️\n\nHug your people friends! Hug them tight!!!\n.\n.\n.\n#covid19 #socialdistance #family #assistedliving #choosehappy #prayer #pray #mydaddy #wecandohardthings #hugyourlove","NumberOfLikes":52,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#socialdistance","#family","#assistedliving","#choosehappy","#prayer","#pray","#mydaddy","#wecandohardthings","#hugyourlove"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Leah McQueen \u2022 Young Living on August 15, 2020 tagging @leahsmcqueen, @pearls_of_hope_with_purpose, @artshannon2024, and @jamesshannoniv.

And when NPHET are worried, we should be worried. \n\nWhen it comes to #covid19 we CANNOT become complacent. We must NEVER STOP. Remember it\u2019s up to us to stop the spread of this disease: to protect our loved ones. The fight is daily. Hourly. \n\nI know for one thing I don\u2019t want to end up back stocking up on toilet paper. I don\u2019t want another lockdown. Do you? \n\nWe need to keep up the social distancing.

Usually I throw a fat BBQ at Lincoln Park complete with games, food, & sunsets, but because of the closure I had to scale back, like waaay back! But it gave me a great opportunity to utilize my beautiful backyard. My event & party planner sister @claudiavdesigns did an exquisite job decorating. Under tea lights, hummingbirds, & an intimate groups of friends, I celebrated year 38. Claudia even found a letter my mom started writing to me before she passed. Later in the week we floated like little ducks 💛 down the Yakima.  Social distance bdays can be challenging, but it doesn\u2019t make them any less special.

If one of the kids went into the gate of the pasture and the other walked along the outside instead, we'd end up trapped on one side or the other. We were just a few feet apart, but still not quite together. The barbs were a small, but effective way to separate us. These days of weathering through a pandemic with a world of social distancing, we can often find ourselves a bit apart from one another, like bunnies on different sides of a barbed wire fence. And though, I may not have the urge to touch noses like bunnies might, hugs are still something that I miss most of all these days.

Covid isn\u2019t gone. \nLet me repeat that for the folks in the back...\nCOVID ISN\u2019T GONE!!!\nNot yet. Yesterday nearly 1500 new deaths were reported in the USA. That\u2019s the highest single day tally since mid-May 😫🤯. We know respiratory droplets are the most substantial mode of transmission. We are still months out from a possible vaccine. And we know masks work! They help to prevent the spread. That\u2019s the goal. PREVENT THE SPREAD. That way kids can go back to school. That way we can get back to sports. That way the economy can build back up. \n.\nMasks have been proven to be safe time and time again. There is no substantiated evidence that says CO2 levels build up significantly when wearing a cloth mask. If you wash them, they won\u2019t get \u201Cmoldy\u201D or whatever people are trying to claim. There is no known medical condition (besides a severe skin condition like a severe facial burn) that should prevent mask tolerance. Think of it this way, you can wear a scarf in the winter to keep your face warm right? Same deal. Just different reason. There\u2019s lots of different styles of masks and you probably just need to find one that actually fits your face! These masks are not one size fits all. If you feel like you are sucking the fabric in all the time, maybe your mask is too tight. Or maybe you should try a mask bracket (see last photo...you can buy on Amazon). \n.\n.\nThis isn\u2019t about politics. It\u2019s simply about public health and looking out for your fellow mankind. Please do your part. \nLove always, Dr. J\n.\n.\n.\n#maskon #maskup #covid19 #covid_19 #educateyourself #wearamask #socialdistance #stopthespread #sports #economy #science #scienceisreal #mankind #lovethyneighbor #usa #newyorkstrong #america\n#topdoctor #drj #womeninmedicine #health #injury #healtheworld #lovemyjob #practicewhatyoupreach #nycdoctor #doctorsofinstagram #mask","NumberOfLikes":151,"Hashtags":["#maskon","#maskup","#covid19","#covid_19","#educateyourself","#wearamask","#socialdistance","#stopthespread","#sports","#economy","#science","#scienceisreal","#mankind","#lovethyneighbor","#usa","#newyorkstrong","#america","#topdoctor","#drj","#womeninmedicine","#health","#injury","#healtheworld","#lovemyjob","#practicewhatyoupreach","#nycdoctor","#doctorsofinstagram","#mask"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":10,"Timestamp":1597359931,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 14 01:05:31 CEST 2020","Location":"New York, New York"},{"CaptionText":"And this too shall pass\n#breathe\n#socialdistance \n#solitude\n#om\n#mycamp\n#rivercamp\n#trees\n#adventure\n#gooutside\n#flowstates\n#disconnect\n#reconnect\n#rewire\n#reboot\n#tuneout\n#camping \n#snowmelt\n#wimhof\n#coldplunge\n#grateful","NumberOfLikes":29,"Hashtags":["#breathe","#socialdistance","#solitude","#om","#mycamp","#rivercamp","#trees","#adventure","#gooutside","#flowstates","#disconnect","#reconnect","#rewire","#reboot","#tuneout","#camping","#snowmelt","#wimhof","#coldplunge","#grateful"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1597359911,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 14 01:05:11 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"We are done with finishing our signs and the two sanitation stations.\n\nIt started 3 weeks ago with creating our signs.
