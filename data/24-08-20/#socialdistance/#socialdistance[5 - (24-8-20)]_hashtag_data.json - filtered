The results in my confidence levels are incomparable.\n\n1️\u20E3 The 1st picture was taken in January, 2020. I was off the beer with 2 weeks and only beginning my latest journey. I was pretty miserable at this time and trying my hardest to drag myself out of the hole I'd found myself in. Getting to the gym alone was a major accomishment. \n\nI always remember how I felt on that day. I was so anxious. My confidence levels were at rock bottom and I was so paranoid that everyone was judging me. I was very uncomfortable the whole time. But, I always remeber thinking, 'I'm never going to feel this way again'. It was like ⛽ to the 🔥. From that moment, I knew I'd have to work my ass off to get into shape.\n\n2️\u20E3 This photo was taken 8 months later. Last Friday, August 14th to be exact. It was the first time I'd been into a gym in 6 months and I've not lifed a weight within that time frame. Pure cadio, alcohol free and inprovements on my diet was the magic formula. \n\nI felt so confident. I felt like a bad ass. I felt proud. I felt a level of accomplisment. The transformation had really occurred and I'd surpassed all my goals.\n\nEveryone has to start somewhere. Everyone's weight loss and health journey begins with a decision. A decision to change. The next thing is to take action and go workout. Get your body active. By getting active alone, you'll notice huge differences in your mental health. And then, work hard. Stay consistent and trust in the process. Hard work will yield results.","NumberOfLikes":104,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Shane Goggin - Laoch in London, United Kingdom.

I\u2019ve seen many moms talking about how difficult distance learning is, all the extra work & having to teach everything themselves, is hard. Everyone wants schools to open because its important. But the matter of fact is- it isn\u2019t going to be back to normal for a while. So the best we can do, is to let the reality set in. Focus on your next step. I have been handling this much better than I expected. And I\u2019m doing so because I\u2019ve decided not to let the stress get to me. Schooling is important, but there\u2019s also a lot that goes along with that. Mental & physical health, especially. Making sure your kids are physically active, that they get enough rest, enough social interaction & are mentally healthy is SO important. So many parents are putting a lot more pressure on their kids-and it\u2019s already hard enough. Distanced learning is going to be hard & I feel the best way to make sure your kids are going to succeed is by making sure your kids are happy and healthy. This is a difficult time for them too, and they are just kids! So many will fall behind in school because of the stress. That\u2019s just how it is right now. What\u2019s important is Mental & physical health, Social interaction (mental health) Get these kids to FaceTime with friends after school. Make it a priority. & Set a realistic schedule. It might take a week or two to get the hang of your schedule especially if you have more than one kid at home. Make sure your kids are retaining the information that they are learning. Because that\u2019s all that REALLY matters. Get the assignments done the best you can. But as long as you are keeping your kids mentally happy...learning & retaining the information WILL come easier than if they feel this huge amount of stress. What matters is that they are LEARNING. Families are losing their jobs, losing homes, losing family members. School districts know this. All you can do is the best that YOU can do. & remember to take care of yourself as well. Go on a walk every night, get some \u201Cme\u201D time. Being happy, is SO important. Don\u2019t stress. Just do the best you can. That is all.

It is fertile ground; the place where children strengthen social bonds, build emotional maturity, develop cognitive skills, and shore up their physical health. 💚⠀\n⠀\nKids know intuitively that play time is essential. Many teachers and parents also understand that it\u2019s crucial for a child\u2019s proper development. And increasingly, science is supporting this argument.⠀\nFor example, The Atlantic article refers to studies stating that free unstructured play helps children develop self-regulation skills, which helps them calm themselves and focus in class.⠀\nWe know that both structured activities and free play are essential for kids\u2019 proper development. But times have changed and for so many of us, with both parents working, there is often no other option but to program children with camps and activities during the summer. So how can we make sure that our kids get their unstructured time? 🌻⠀\n⠀\nHere are some suggestions:⠀\nMake frequent trips to the playground and let your kids take risks⠀\nVisit farms, forests, and ravines where kids can explore nature⠀\nBecome a play angel so your kids will have a safe environment for kid-led play⠀\nChoose a camp that values free play and discovery time for kids⠀\nStart a Parent Club with a group of friends⠀\nMake sure evenings and weekends include lots of downtime.⠀\nThough challenging, it\u2019s definitely not impossible to give kids the freedom they need during their break from the school year. How do you make sure your kids have time for free play?⠀\n⠀\nhttps:\/\/buff.ly\/33ybDGV","NumberOfLikes":19,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Champions for Life Foundation on August 13, 2020.

Maybe the body (and mind) feels like it's dragging. Turn the tide and get the vitality to flow back in! \n\nThere's been more than one factor affecting people in unhealthy ways, indirectly related or unrelated to the coronavirus. State restrictions\/quarantine, focusing attention on how to protect ourselves and others from infection, limits on where to go and available activities, plus summer heat, and other factors can contribute to fatigue. Plus, you may feel it more if you're older. \n\nWhile some of these are beyond our direct control, what you CAN do to flip the fatigue and regain energy is nutrition. Smart carbs--slow and steady wins the race--includes whole grains, fruit, vegetables; good calories (avoid the processed foods and too many sweets); proteins (don't skimp on these, but be sure to get them from healthy sources, such as nuts, beans, lean meats, etc.); healthy hydration (and it doesn't just have to be in the form of drink, as there are fruits and vegetables that are good sources of hydration, too). \n\nFor further info to good food and less fatigue, copy this link into your browser's address bar. \nhttps:\/\/bit.ly\/3kd3kGo\n\n@personalcarechiropra\n@ConsumerReports\n\n#Chiropractic\n#Chiropractor\n#chiropracticcare\n#ArlingtonChiropractor\n#arlingtonchiropractic\n#wellness\n#wellnesstips\n#takecare\n#wellbeing\n#SelfCareTips\n#HealthyLife\n#QualityLife\n#HealthProtection\n#ProtectYourHealth\n#together\n#SocialDistance\n#HealthyEating\n#HealthyEatingTips\n#HealthyNutrition\n#SelfCare\n#diet\n#fatigue\n#SlowCarbs\n#WholeGrains\n#legumes\n#fruits\n#vegetables\n#FruitsAndVegetables","NumberOfLikes":5,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Personal Care Chiro & Massage on August 13, 2020.

Landscape photography that transports you to the heart of Italy. While of course you'll find this levity in the studio, we'd be amiss if there wasn't some variety in store. By special request, we displayed the caves from Spain right in the studio! From black and white to colorized, these photos could make you hear the low winds and the dripping drops of the cave. Sounds that let you know this cave has withstood the tides of time and makes you wonder what stories it must keeps. LaDonnaFoto has a vast collection in the studio, and the pieces in the studio are always changing, and no two weeks are the same. Now with the addition of the screen, and the ability to make custom requests to LaDonnaFoto, the studio can be almost anything you want it to be! We are of course still practicing #socialdistance at @sawyeryards as safety and health is a number one priority, and while you may not be able to fly to see the depths of the caves in Spain, you can come to the studio and get your own personal cave tour on screen. \n\n#PalmadeMallorca #Spain #DrachCaves #DrachCavesinSpain #Houston #HoustonArtist","NumberOfLikes":9,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597275166,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 13 01:32:46 CEST 2020","Location":"Cuevas del Drach"},{"CaptionText":"Missin these 😩\n.\n.\n#SpaceCowboy #nofilter #tbt #Love #SocialDistance #covid19 #Race #OOTD #Beach #AmericanMuscle #Cars #Steeda #Summer #sneakernews #fitness #gym #Mustang #Hollywood #FordPerformance #MustangGT #V8 #LosAngeles #gt350 #gt500 #BeachVibes #s550 #shelbymustang #stang #CJPonyParts #LMR","NumberOfLikes":29,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Jay in Space Station with @xtremeaudio_motorsports, @latemodelresto, @fordperformance, @americanmusclecom, @cjponyparts, and @steedaautosports.

In that statement, she stated that I had tested negative for COVID-19. \n\nAfter receiving the negative test result and following the Department of Public Health and Social Services (DPHSS) protocol, I continued to monitor myself for symptoms, wore a face mask, and practiced social distancing. However, this afternoon, I began to exhibit mild symptoms, including a slight fever, chills, and a cough, and felt it was necessary to test again. Tonight, I received a positive result. \n\nDespite exhibiting moderate symptoms of the virus, I remain in good health. I will continue my isolation pending clearance from my health care provider. \n\nOnce we were informed of Governor Leon Guerrero\u2019s status, all in person meetings were canceled immediately, and most operations were shifted online. These operations will continue uninterrupted. Contact tracing is ongoing, and testing is underway for staff identified as close contacts.\n\nTo the people of Guam, we stay the course. We maintain our COVID-19 response\u2014steadfast as ever. Governor Leon Guerrero\u2019s condition has been improving daily, and government operations continue with all the safety measures in place. \n\nTomorrow, we will take a series of steps to redouble our effort against COVID-19 and keep Guam safe. \n\nWe must practice caution. Wear your face mask around those outside of your household. Practice good hygiene. Maintain a social distance of at least six feet. The best course of action is to act as if you are infected with the virus. \n\nWhile Governor Leon Guerrero and I will get through this, more importantly the people of Guam will too. \n\n#GuamRecovery #StaySafe #StayHealthy #LtGov #Statement #Guam #VisitGuam #InstaGuam #PublicHealth #Updates #GuamNews #GuamUpdates #SlowtheSpread #StoptheSpread #WearAMask #SocialDistance #Hygiene #covid19 #coronavirus #combatcovid #fever #chills #positive #testing #guahan","NumberOfLikes":17,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Guam Recovery in Guam with @jtenogu.

I did everything to negate and purify my Lower Self. I spent hours upon hours in hardcore, physical worship. But it didn't really help much in purifying the Lower Self. The ego was always bending towards negativity. The ego didn't seem to be affected by any hardcore worship. \u2063\n\u2063\n✨The moment I started to accumulate love for my Master, HDE Gohar Shahi - it was the first beam of love that crushed my ego.

Here's my take. \n#WAP is an opportunity to:\n1) Celebrate the creativity of Black women - yes, I realize that black women may not have been the only folks involved in writing the verses, laying down the beats, creating the video concepts, etc. Regardless, the metaphors and lyrical creativity were on point.\n2) Celebrate the beauty of Black (female) bodies - Cardi b and Meg showed up in their full thyckness for the video.🍑\n3) Celebrate Black (female) collaboration - the collaboration included not only Cardi b and Meg Thee Stallion, but also @KylieJenner @normani @sukihanagoat @therubirose @rosalia.vt @mulatto. Support Black artists, support Black creators, support Black women...PERIODT.\n4) Celebrate Black sexuality - the sexuality of Black women is always being policed, from politicians to physicians to pimps. During this video 1 take on female sexuality is on full display! Does it describe the sexuality of EVERY Black woman? Of course not. But it does describe some Black women, and some women in general. \n*\nSo if WAP isn't for you, then don't partake, but keep your judgments to yourself 🤷🏾\u200D♀️ and allow other folks to celebrate all the grandeur of WAP. \n* \nAgree or Disagree 🤔? ⬇️ Share your thoughts.\n*\n*\n#NewDayPsycCoach #blackpsychologist #LifeCoachdfw #speaker #affirmations #identity #podcast #RelationshipGoals #RelationshipCoach #femalesexuality #hiphop #LoveYourself #BlackBusinesses #BoyMom #family #NaturalHair #YouOkSis #MentalIllness #GreekLife #BlackCulture #dfw #INTJ #college #empowered #socialdistance #wearamask\n#LinkInBio","NumberOfLikes":34,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Dr 'T' - Affirmation Coach in Arlington, Texas.

This isolation is far from being the most difficult thing I\u2019ve ever gone through in my life personally, but it\u2019s so easy to get caught up in the frustrations and inconveniences of change and being pushed out of the normalcy of what we are so accustomed to. There are definitely ebbs and flows and days that are harder than others, especially for those of us who are doing quarantine alone. But the reminder of all the little blessings, how much health is wealth right now, just trusting in God, being grateful for what I have and staying the course, one day at a time, truly gets me through. This isn\u2019t just about ourselves, and our own personal comfort, it\u2019s about all of us together and most importantly, health. Start caring.

This may also work when teaching social distancing. For example, you may show a child how you stop on each X on the ground and then move forward and stop on the next X.Or, you may demonstrate to a child how you stop at a distance from another person, can hold out your hand for a fist bump, and that\u2019s the correct distance to stop. However, for these formats to be helpful, your child must have already shown in the past they learn well from imitation.\n\nIf your child struggles with imitation, this step is also a perfect time to make sure your child can differentiate between when someone is practicing social distancing correctly or incorrectly. For example, if focusing on skill A (see previous steps), you could alternate between standing too close to a person or the correct distance from a person and have your child identify (yes or no) if you are social distancing correctly. #socialdistance #socialdistancing #abc #abcforautism #ABA #safe","NumberOfLikes":1,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Applied Behavior Center on August 11, 2020.
