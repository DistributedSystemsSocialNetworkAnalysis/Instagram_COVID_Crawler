N95 mask, no exhalation valve, fitted (14)\n2. Surgical mask (1)\u20283. Cotton-polypropylene-cotton mask (5)\u20284. Two-layer polypropylene apron mask (4)\u20285. Two-layer cotton, pleated style mask (13)\u20286. Two-layer cotton, pleated style mask (7)\u20287. N95 mask with exhalation valve (2)\u20288. Two-layer cotton, Olston style mask (8)\u20289. One-layer Maxima AT mask (6)\u202810. One-layer cotton, pleated style mask (10)\u202811. Two-layer cotton, pleated style mask (9)\u202812. Knitted mask (3)\u202813. Bandana (12)\u202814. Gaiter type neck fleece (11)\n\nSurprising to note that the neck fleece was found to actually increase the risk of transmission. 2nd worst was the bandana but did not increase risk of transmission followed by knitted mask being the 3rd worst. \nThe most effective was a fitted N-95 mask without valves which had a transmission rate of 0.1% - these are for healthcare workers. \nA surgical mask performed 2nd best, while a polypropylene came in 3rd. \nHandmade cotton face masks were also shown to perform well. \n\nWearing masks is important, but also wear one that will actually work. If everyone wore a mask, we could stop up to 99% of these droplets before they reach someone else.

In total, the island nation of 5 million people has reported 22 coronavirus deaths. While other countries \u2014 including Pacific neighbor Australia and the United States \u2014 continue to battle outbreaks, New Zealand has been held up as an example of how to fight Covid-19. New Zealand's strategy was simple: in the words of Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, the country had to \"go hard, and go early.\" When Ardern closed the border to foreigners on March 19, the country only had 28 confirmed cases. And when she announced a nationwide lockdown on March 23, there were only 102 confirmed cases, and no deaths.

It is not inherited. And oftentimes, greatness isn't appreciated or recognised until you see greatness anywhere no more\u2063.\n\u2063\nü§´The secret of greatness lies within you. There is no discrimination from God. Anybody can be great. You have the formula of greatness inside you. It depends on you if you want to be great. If you want to be great, you can be great.\u2063\n\u2063\nThat secret recipe of greatness is inside you. There are so many souls inside you. Nothing is out of your reach. When you reach God, you will be at the pinnacle of your journey. That is the culmination.\u2063\n\u2063\nGreatness is not inherited.\u2063\n\u2063\nüë®\u200D‚úàÔ∏è If your father is a pilot, do you assume you will be a pilot all by yourself, without any training or education? If your father is a great batsman, do you think you'll be a great batsman without making any effort? Why then do people think that if the father is a saint of God, then the son or daughter will be a saint of God too?\u2063\n\u2063\n‚ù§Ô∏èYou will be a saint of God if God wants you to be his friend. It depends on God and you. Your family is not involved; the decision is taken by God. If God is willing, he will accept you as a friend. \u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n#alratv¬†#goharshahi¬†#younusalgohar¬†#sufi¬†#sufism¬†#agapelove¬†#saint¬†#fate¬†#divinelove¬†#lovequotes¬†#divine¬†#purification¬†#compassion¬†#greatness¬†#selfesteem¬†#selfimprovement¬†#creation¬†#Nirvana¬†#higherself¬†#theself¬†#happiness¬†#motivation¬†#UniversalSufi¬†#hope¬†#socialdistance¬†#hope¬†#strength¬†#positiveenergy¬†#enlightenment¬†#evolve","NumberOfLikes":6,"Hashtags":["#Repost","#alratv","#goharshahi","#younusalgohar","#sufi","#sufism","#agapelove","#saint","#fate","#divinelove","#lovequotes","#divine","#purification","#compassion","#greatness","#selfesteem","#selfimprovement","#creation","#Nirvana","#higherself","#theself","#happiness","#motivation","#UniversalSufi","#hope","#socialdistance","#hope","#strength","#positiveenergy","#enlightenment","#evolve"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Tahira Mateen on August 10, 2020.

It is not inherited. And oftentimes, greatness isn't appreciated or recognised until you see greatness anywhere no more\u2063.\n\u2063\nü§´The secret of greatness lies within you. There is no discrimination from God. Anybody can be great. You have the formula of greatness inside you. It depends on you if you want to be great. If you want to be great, you can be great.\u2063\n\u2063\nThat secret recipe of greatness is inside you. There are so many souls inside you. Nothing is out of your reach. When you reach God, you will be at the pinnacle of your journey.

To be focusing on school work,keeping social distance and constantly sanitizing plus constantly wearing a mask is a bit too much for some of them. \nSometimes we ourselves as adults forget our mask, forget to wash hands as simple as it may sound. \nThis pandemic doesn't seem to be going anywhere anytime soon and as much as i understand that education is key, HEALTH is the most vital of them all. \nWhat will our kids do with an education if they are ill and lying on a sick bed in a hospital.\nThe older kids who understand and can manage to keep up can go to school but our babies aren't ready for this. \n.\n \n#socialdistance #parenthood #motherhood #fatherhood #parenthood #childhood #loveyourkids #caribbeanmoms #caribbeanparents #alphababiesandbeyond #momstruggles #toddlerstuff #mommystuff #pregnantnowwhat #postpartumdepression #momtalk #pregnancytalk #covid19 #healthiswealth #","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#socialdistance","#parenthood","#motherhood","#fatherhood","#parenthood","#childhood","#loveyourkids","#caribbeanmoms","#caribbeanparents","#alphababiesandbeyond","#momstruggles","#toddlerstuff","#mommystuff","#pregnantnowwhat","#postpartumdepression","#momtalk","#pregnancytalk","#covid19","#healthiswealth"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Alpha Babies & Beyond on August 10, 2020.

Can you do the same to protect me from your possible exposure too? Wearing a mask, social distancing, handwashing and being a responsible human being does not step on your first amendment rights or any human rights for that matter.

Take the above picture for example: there are 19 people in this picture. 19!!! DURING COVID?? How can this possibly be ok??? \n.\nIt\u2019s simple: perspective.\n.\nSee how all the people look tiny? It\u2019s because the photographer is far away from the picture. \n.\nWhat you can\u2019t see is that before the picture was taken we all put our arms out to our sides, made sure no one was touching, then dropped our arms to our sides or our hips. \n.\nIn general your wingspan (how far across your arms and torso are when you reach them straight out at shoulder height) is about the same as your height (crazy right?!). There are some people with a longer wingspan (Michael Phelps is an example). SO while not everyone in the photo is 6\u2019, there were enough tall folks, and making sure our fingers didn\u2019t touch gave us some extra inches to make it to that 6\u2019.\n.\nTHUS, you have 19 people with great CV fitness (we can all run farther than 5k) meaning our lungs are in better shape than those who can\u2019t do this, OUTSIDE (the safest place to be in the presence of others), appropriately socially distanced üòä\n.\nTrue, we could be wearing masks\/face coverings to be even safer, but let\u2019s all remember these are crazy times, and if the worst thing these 19 people do is run a socially-distanced 5k on a track outdoors then I\u2019d say they\u2019re basically nailing it.\n.\nIt can be too easy to judge others negatively, especially now, so let\u2019s try to promote support, understanding, and best practices to stop the spread of COVID however we can ‚ò∫Ô∏è (for those interested in the guidelines we\u2019ve been following be on the lookout for another post later when I\u2019m off work!)\n.\n.\n.\n#runningisnotcancelled #socialdistance #covid #runners #runningtraining #runforgood #timetrial #trackworkout #perspective #themoreyouknow #love #bethelight #community #support #halfmarathon #marathon #5k #ultrarunners #besafe #besmart #dontthrowstones #whatyoucantsee #instareality #fvrc #ffvrc #health #mentalhealth #fitness #crazytimes","NumberOfLikes":31,"Hashtags":["#runningisnotcancelled","#socialdistance","#covid","#runners","#runningtraining","#runforgood","#timetrial","#trackworkout","#perspective","#themoreyouknow","#love","#bethelight","#community","#support","#halfmarathon","#marathon","#5k","#ultrarunners","#besafe","#besmart","#dontthrowstones","#whatyoucantsee","#instareality","#fvrc","#ffvrc","#health","#mentalhealth","#fitness","#crazytimes"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Kat VW on August 10, 2020.

Your friends may not be able to see your smile, but they can see your eyes light up and hear your warm tone and intention. üòÅ\n\nFor all of my \"Unmasking Your Message\" tips, visit my blog at www.givegreatvoice.com \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n#tasiavalenza #butlikemaybe #cartoon #maskup #masks #wearingamask #speaking #speaker #speakingtips #masktips #communicationtips #communication #socialdistancing #bodylanguage #physicaldistancing #socialdistance #covid19 #wellness #health #vo #voartist #voiceoverartist #mondaymotivation #upworthy #todayshowaustralia","NumberOfLikes":101,"Hashtags":["#givegreatvoice","#tasiavalenza","#butlikemaybe","#cartoon","#maskup","#masks","#wearingamask","#speaking","#speaker","#speakingtips","#masktips","#communicationtips","#communication","#socialdistancing","#bodylanguage","#physicaldistancing","#socialdistance","#covid19","#wellness","#health","#vo","#voartist","#voiceoverartist","#mondaymotivation","#upworthy","#todayshowaustralia"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Tasia Valenza in Los Angeles, California with @butlikemaybe.

In addition, each step provides additional insight that may be useful for development of the skill.  We will be sharing each step daily on our social media platforms.\n\nStep 2: Describe the Steps of the Skill\n\nOn the surface, social distancing may seem like a simple skill.  It means stay 6 feet away from other people.  But in reality, your child may need help with specific scenarios.  Defining exactly what you are trying to teach your child will help focus the additional steps you take.  What are you really trying to accomplish?  Is it just to stay 6 feet away from others or do you need to focus on:\n\nA.  If you are walking toward someone, stop when you are 6 feet away.\nB.  If you are walking past other people, make sure you are staying 6 feet away.\nC.  If someone walks toward you, make sure you back up so you stay 6 feet away.\nD.  Whenever you see an X in public and you are with your parents, stand on the X!\nE.  When you are in school and there is taped off areas, stay in the box!\nF.  Be ready to walk with me to the sidewalk on the other side of the street if someone is walking toward us.\n\nStep two is all about making sure it\u2019s clear to your child exactly what they need to do.

After tragically losing his mom and best friend in car accidents, he turned to soccer to deal with the grief. Soccer became a huge part of his life, and he played for years. After moving to Toronto, soccer continued to be a coping mechanism for Mo, as living in a new country and big city was an overwhelming change that brought many challenges. However, joining several indoor soccer leagues and playing a couple games a week still didn\u2019t quite feel good enough. But then, Mo found running! Inspired by seeing runners in the streets, he decided to give it a try! \u201CUnlike soccer or the gym, I liked the idea of being in control of my activity, just put on shoes & run!\u201D After years of solo running, Mo founded a running group called Downtown Toronto Runners which expanded to reach over 600 members while active! \n\nIn Summer 2019, Mo continued to join more running groups which motivated his journey into racing. I remember the first time I ran with a crew, I listened to runners talking about their races & PBs and I was like \u201CWow I want to reach that level!\u201D And Mo did just that, as he completed the Scotiabank Waterfront Half Marathon in 1:42 hours and the Tannanbeum 10k in 44:21! Running in Toronto is uniquely special for Mo, as it allowed him to learn to navigate the city and discover all its beauty, such as the waterfront path.\n\nDespite 2020 being a challenge to Mo\u2019s running plans due to reasons like the cancellation of the Chicago marathon which he was set to run, Mo has continued racing. Mo completed his first full marathon on Martin Goodman trail in June as well as his first trail marathon! Mo also completed a 5K race with @forbiddenfive and set a new pb of 19:22! Mo also continued training resiliently during  the celebration of Ramadan in May despite fasting 16 hours a day for 30 days. The new circumstances of fasting and social distancing caused Mo to adapt his solo running schedule to late night runs. Despite the challenges he came out mentally and physically stronger having run 271km during that time!\nMo\u2019s gpal are to give back to the run community through running for change and BIPOC inclusion!","NumberOfLikes":189,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Runners of The Six on August 10, 2020 tagging @raydiantproductions, @mo14tarek, and @everydayfit.mo.

As Central America\u2019s most unequal country, with a poverty level of 68 percent, 60 percent of Honduras' population works in the informal sector, with no secure form of employment.\n‚†Ä\nüëâ  With about one million Hondurans living outside the country, the economy relies heavily on remittances from its diaspora, most of which reside in the United States and Spain. Last year, remittances made up 21.4 per cent of GDP.\n‚†Ä\nIntuitive and informed economic predictions have suggested that remittances to the Central American country would crash during the crisis, but this has not been the case. Payments have in fact increased compared to the same period in 2019, after a dip earlier this year.\n‚†Ä\nüòç With regards to aid in the form of remittances and other support, diasporic organizations have provided a great deal of help. Informal efforts such as @unidos.por.honduras, have been incredibly successful.\n‚†Ä\nüî•üî• These impacts are contrary to what experts would have predicted and are not consistent with trends elsewhere in the world.\n‚†Ä\nTogether we can make much more!

That's why we've been putting so much effort into doing videos and information sheets in Karen, Dari and Dinka language for our community. It's why we've been providing support to KR Castlemaine, Hazeldene's Chicken Farm, City if Greater Bendigo and other organisations to support their staff.

I am Dr. Hina Talib, a teen doc and toddler mom. Some school-reopening thoughts here, more\u2009\non the emotional toll tomorrow. \u2009\n\u2009\nAs shared at a UCSF webinar by Dr. Bardach, the heart of reopening plans is this: what is good for teachers, is good for students, is good for families. I would add that equity, safety, wellness, communication & collaboration are key pillars as well. \u2009\n\u2009\nI have been working with my preschool\u2019s re-opening task-force & so I am in-tune with just how much practical effort it is. I even (hurray!) had a letter published in print in @nytimes last Sunday asking the city to designate more outdoor spaces for students (like they do for bars). \u2009\n\u2009\nI wish we heard more from the NYC child-care centers & schools that were open throughout this pandemic for families with essential workers, like myself, with no reported child-transmissions. What they did, how they did it is key. \u2009\n\u2009\nSome points from Dr. Bardach & other Peds ID friends:\u2009\n\u2009\nWithout a low & stable local test-positive rate, we should not be having the in-person conversation.\u2009\nChildren get COVID-19 less often & get less ill than adults. Age 15 years seems to be a transition point.\u2009\nSeveral large contact-tracing studies show that children are not major sources of transmission to each other or to adults. \u2009\nThere are age-based differences, with implications pointing to opening preschools\/elementary schools ahead of high school\/colleges.\u2009\n\u2009\nWhy do littles not transmit as much? We don\u2019t know but we will soon, because.. science. \u2009\nTheories include lower ACE2-receptor gene expression, lower total lung volumes, less force of expulsion with cough, different immune response whereby they clear the virus faster. Would love to hear other theories you have! Don\u2019t even get me started on that Chicago study finding symptomatic kids had virus in their nares, they were symptomatic, duh! And this study did not examine transmission, the contact tracing studies do. \u2009\n\u2009\nKeep on the look out for elegant research coming from Dr. Bardach looking at COVID19 in K-8 camps in SF this summer. It is very hopeful!\u2009\n\u2009\nAlso, this Friday at 12:30, I will go live with @drlucymcbride to talk about school reopening, join us!","NumberOfLikes":182,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":38,"Timestamp":1597022061,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 10 03:14:21 CEST 2020","Location":"Bridgehampton, New York"},{"CaptionText":"Social Distancing: It's the kind and responsible thing to do ‚ù§Ô∏è","NumberOfLikes":25,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by THE ANNEX FOOD HALL on August 09, 2020.

However a legal international custody agreement is considered essential travel.\n\nThis is the last time Ryan will see his dad for an undetermined amount of time. After Ryan's visits with his dad he is placed in a mandatory 14 day quarantine at home in Canada. What this means is that if he were to visit his dad, he would not be allowed to attend school.\n\nRyan's dad and I are close. If you know us you know it's almost weird. We're pretty much best friends. Ryan's step mom and I are even better friends lol. However this decision came with some disagreements, some anxiety, and lots of tears.\n\nThe thing is, I'm not a 4th grade teacher and keeping him home would set him so far back during an already vulnerable time in his life. We're not prepared to have him face the long term effects of that.\n\nI see news articles about teenagers not being able to visit friends, and families not being able to see aunts, uncles, etc... but can you imagine... a little boy literally being separated from his dad for at least months?\n\nI'm begging you to wear the dang mask.

But if visiting between mid-April through mid-to-end July, definitely consider a stop in this coastal, northern county spot for some of the area's sweetest and freshest strawberries. üçì\n\u2022\nStarting in mid April, the @carlsbadstrawberrycompany tends to kickstart the season by initially opening its strawberry stand locations. Typically, you can buy boxes of pre-picked strawberries here starting at 9 am. The stands generally close¬†once the daily supply is sold out.\n\u2022\nAround mid May, the @carlsbadstrawberrycompany then opens their main harvest fields to the public, where you can enjoy the classic, past-time activity of strawberry picking. If you\u2019re lucky you\u2019ll also pick an evening with a vibrant red sunset.\n\u2022\nWhile this experience may be new to tourists, it's a fairly well known activity for most San Diego locals. This is largely due to the fact that this family-owned company has been in operation for the past four generations. \n\u2022\nConveniently, the strawberry fields are located only a few blocks from The Flower Fields at Carlsbad Ranch - another must-see destination. This iconic Carlsbad location is home to a variety of flowers known as the Tecolote¬Æ Giant Ranunculus, more commonly known as the Persian Buttercup or Ranunculus Asiatic. üå∏üåº\n\u2022\nWhile the flower fields are open every year from March 1st through May 10th (Mother's Day), the \"peak\" season is generally between mid-March through mid-April. Despite the above, if you want to be able to both see the flowers and pick the strawberries, we would definitely recommend going around early to mid-May. \n\u2022\nIf you have additional information, tips, or stories from your trip here, please share and comment below! üí¨\n\u2022\nüá∫üá∏ Destination: #carlsbadstrawberryfields\nüì∏ Photographer: @marianaamerlos\nüîé Source: @carlsbadstrawberrycompany\nüîé Source: @the_flower_fields\nüåé Wanderer: @jernemarie\n‚ú® Ready to be featured?\n1Ô∏è\u20E3 Follow @wnwtravel\n2Ô∏è\u20E3 Tag @wnwtravel\n3Ô∏è\u20E3 Use #WanderNotWonder\n\u2022\nWNWxUSA\nWNWxCalifornia","NumberOfLikes":403,"Hashtags":["#carlsbadstrawberryfields","#WanderNotWonder"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Wander Not Wonder in Carlsbad Strawberry Company with @marianaamerlos, @the_flower_fields, @jernemarie, @carlsbadstrawberrycompany, and @wnwtravel.

The camaraderie. The essence of everything it aesthetically defied about the grotesquely objectified state of female bodies in video culture.

If you can, watch them back to back. Both docs speak towards the rife sexual and financial exploitation of womenfolk in the industry and  the complicity of the culture that feeds on it.  It's taken decades for the survivors of these abuses to finally find the platforms to speak out. Whatever justice actually is, I don't know if or when it'll come, but this pandemic season surely seems to be the time of purge and reckoning.\n\n‚ö´ _____________ ‚ö´ ____________ ‚ö´\n\n#SelfIsolationCinemaSociety\nA #SocialDistance SafeHouse\nPowered by #ThinkCinematic\n¬©@THINKcinematic","NumberOfLikes":2,"Hashtags":["#Joy:","#1990s","#TLC.","#TBoz.","#LeftEye","#WhatAboutYourFriends.","#Blackmusic","#90snostalgia","#OnTheRecord","#SkyDocumentaries.","#TheRemixHipHopXFashion","#Netflix","#SelfIsolationCinemaSociety","#SocialDistance","#ThinkCinematic"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Jana Sante on August 09, 2020.
