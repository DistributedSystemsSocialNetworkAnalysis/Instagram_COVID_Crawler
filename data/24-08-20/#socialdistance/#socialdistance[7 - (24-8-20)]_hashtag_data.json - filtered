But it\u2019s also worth thinking about whether you\u2019re working at home or not. \u2063\n\u2063\nWhatever position you find yourself in during the day, ask yourself - \u201Ccan I take a full breath here?\u201D\u2063\n\u2063\nIf you can\u2019t take a full breath at any time, you should change your position. \u2063\n\u2063\nContinue adjusting your position throughout the day and make sure that you can breathe effectively wherever you are. \u2063\n\u2063\nAlso, go give Kelly a follow @thereadystate as well as @xptlife - they\u2019re both putting out some great content. \u2063\n\u2063\n#one22 #strengthcapacityresilience #breathmechanics \u2063\n\u2063\n#Repost @xptlife with @make_repost\u2063\n・・・\u2063\nSo many of the lessons and tools you\u2019ve learned by joining us in person, or here digitally, can be repurposed during this time of shelter in place.

Vakanties verdienen we, een dagje spa verdienen we. \nZeker nadat de beperkingen van de intelligente lockdown wat zijn versoepeld, vonden mensen dat ze wel weer recht hadden op hun  jaarlijkse vakantie naar zonnige oorden. Voor wat hoort wat. Maar wat eigenlijk? De eerste weken van de intelligente lockdown vonden velen prima te pruimen; lekker rustig,  onthaasten, me-time. Sommigen durfden het zelfs een blessing te noemen, terwijl mensen vochten voor hun leven en die strijd soms verloren. Met opoffering en solidariteit had  het weinig te maken. Echte opoffering is het pas als je iets doet voor de gemeenschap, ook al raakt het gevaar je niet persoonlijk en haal je er geen voordeel uit. \nToen er zoveel niet kon, heb ik ook wel zitten balen. We zijn met zijn allen echt gaan geloven dat vakanties vanzelfsprekend zijn, dat we het nodig hebben om bij te komen en te ontspannen. Terwijl die rust echt in jezelf zit en niet per se in verre bestemmingen. Ik heb mijn geplande tripje naar Ibiza in september  geschrapt.  Al die risico's voor mezelf en anderen voor iets dat weliswaar leuk is, maar totaal overbodig.  Terug naar de foto: ik probeer dichtbij huis mooie plekjes te vinden waar ik met vrienden kan ontspannen met uiteraard de nodige aandacht voor afstand. Een afstand die ik verder juist niet voel, want zonder alle (hang naar) luxe en altijd maar overal heen willen,  blijft daar de basis: de dankbaarheid voor fijne momenten met dito mensen. #haarrijnseplas #haarrijn #utrecht #strand #reflectie #samenzijn #strandje #staycation #bezinning #bewustzijn #bewust zijn #samenzijn #zonnen #zwemmen #natuur #nederlandismooi #socialdistancing #afstand #nabijheid #socialdistance  #smile #zon #zomer #vrienden #friends","NumberOfLikes":42,"Hashtags":["#haarrijnseplas","#haarrijn","#utrecht","#strand","#reflectie","#samenzijn","#strandje","#staycation","#bezinning","#bewustzijn","#bewust","#samenzijn","#zonnen","#zwemmen","#natuur","#nederlandismooi","#socialdistancing","#afstand","#nabijheid","#socialdistance","#smile","#zon","#zomer","#vrienden","#friends"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Marieke in Haarrijnse strand.

New posts of available $10 #Household and $10 #Hygiene #Bundles will be posted weekly this August. All sales events will take place on Saturdays at The Azalea Flea Market. All sales are on a first pay basis. If you want to purchase your bundle in advance, you may message me to pay by Cashapp or Paypal. All bundles must be picked up during @GiftsByAnAngel Flea Market sales event hours of 7-12pm. No deliveries or meet ups will be made. We will have our #Household and #Hygiene bundles in blue bags, as usual.

Cases are INCREASING! This only worsens the quarantine experience.\n\u2063\nWith restaurants especially opening in Pakistan, we encourage everyone to do the following: \u2063\n\u2063\n1. 𝐏𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐞 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐮𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐝𝐨 𝐭𝐚𝐤𝐞-𝐨𝐮𝐭𝐬. By going indoors you\u2019re inviting trouble not only to yourself, but the staff members too. You don\u2019t know how they\u2019ve travelled, which other exposed customers they\u2019ve come in contact with, what measures they\u2019re taking. The same applies to yourself, so why put each other at risk?\u2063\n\u2063\n2. If you must go out, 𝐜𝐡𝐨𝐨𝐬𝐞 𝐚𝐧 𝐨𝐮𝐭𝐝𝐨𝐨𝐫 𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐜𝐞 𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐧 𝐚𝐧 𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐨𝐨𝐫. With the wind, and open air, the risk is not completely gone but is reduced. In a confined space, you\u2019re more likely to breathe the same air and therefore exposed to a higher degree of risk through air particles. E.g. if someone sneezes indoor. \u2063\n\u2063\n3. Maintain strict SOPs in whatever you do. This means to sanitize every time your hand comes in contact, keep your hands away from your face, and here comes the forever protocol: 𝐀𝐋𝗪𝐀𝐘𝐒 𝗪𝐄𝐀𝐑 𝐀 𝐌𝐀𝐒𝐊! Even if someone is infected, they\u2019re doing a far better job by wearing a mask and keeping themselves + others safe from infection (𝘴𝘪𝘥𝘦 𝘯𝘰𝘵𝘦: 𝘪𝘧 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘢𝘳𝘦 𝘪𝘯𝘧𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘦𝘥, 𝘰𝘳 𝘴𝘩𝘰𝘸𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘴𝘪𝘨𝘯𝘴 𝘰𝘧 𝘧𝘭𝘶 𝘰𝘳 𝘧𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳, 𝘱𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘴𝘦 𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘺 𝘢𝘵 𝘩𝘰𝘮𝘦)\u2063\n\u2063\nAt the end of the day: If you haven\u2019t been exposed to COVID19, consider yourself PRIVILEGED. COVID19 is out there regardless, so why take the small risk, at the expense of your health, others\u2019 health, community\u2019s health? \u2063\n\u2063\nStay safe. Stay home. \u2063\n\u2063\n#covidpakistan #pakistan #lahore #karachi #islamabad #covidreliefpakistan #covidrelief #covidreliefpk #sharetoaware #covid19 #socialdistance #wearamask #stayathome #quarantine #healthcomesfirst #tiktok #instagood #staysafe","NumberOfLikes":14,"Hashtags":["#covidpakistan","#pakistan","#lahore","#karachi","#islamabad","#covidreliefpakistan","#covidrelief","#covidreliefpk","#sharetoaware","#covid19","#socialdistance","#wearamask","#stayathome","#quarantine","#healthcomesfirst","#tiktok","#instagood","#staysafe"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1596904892,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 08 18:41:32 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"zeller.sportsmedicine","CaptionText":"Trying to #adultcoloringbook so I don't go postal on people I know going to #sturgis rally.

How do you meditate? How do you \u201Cunplug\u201D? Here are some ideas on how to become more present in life: ⠀\n.⠀\n🔸Create a cell phone free time in your day. Dedicate breaks of time where your cell phone is out of sight, so you can focus and truly be with people during your day. ⠀\n🔸 Silence notifications \u2013 When you are not required to answer a text, call, or email, turn your phone on silent so that you can avoid constant distraction and not be tempted to answer immediately.  Stress can be caused by the pressure felt by having to answer immediately or multi-task. ⠀\n🔸 Tune into nature \u2013 One of the best ways to ensure you are centered and engaged in the present is to be out in nature. Soaking in the sounds, getting some fresh air and sun exposure is amazing for the mind, body, and spirit.⠀\nPhoto credit: @sonialyani ⠀\n.⠀\n.⠀\n.⠀\n#hotyoga #hotyogahouston #theoriginal #acceptnosubstitutes #ihp #infernohotpilates #socialdistance #virtualconnection #letsstaytogether","NumberOfLikes":29,"Hashtags":["#hotyoga","#hotyogahouston","#theoriginal","#acceptnosubstitutes","#ihp","#infernohotpilates","#socialdistance","#virtualconnection","#letsstaytogether"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Hot Yoga Houston on August 08, 2020.

A piece I made in the height of the Black Lives Matter Protests, calling for justice for George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, along with countless other victims of police brutality and violence. As I was drawing this, the news would focus largely on the smaller incidents of riots and street vandalism, caused mostly by just agitators independent of the actual movement. So framing a protestor against a fiery backdrop with the presence of police indicated to the left felt like a good way to get the feeling of being in the moment. The idea of them holding the American Flag was also to indicate the stakes involved, the revolution at place as well as the complicated history BIPOCs have with the US. Same with the colors of the protestor outfit, which are modeled off the Pan African Flag, again denoting the history of Africa and its people with this country. The pose, stoic, prepared, the figure is female and strong, clenched fists, someone who will fight for their right to live.\n\nDrawn in @autodesksketchbook on the iPad Mini 4 using the @53pencil .\n\nNew post Next Friday!!

We are so excited for fall to resume, as we are making as many plans and contingencies as possible to give you hands on learning opportunities in a safe and compliant environment. It\u2019s been a long summer of planning, preparing and designing, but we are getting there. One of the things we have been struggling with, is obtaining certain PPE for labs that have those unique requirements that overlap with the needs of our front line people.  Yesterday, we were able to secure the N95 masks required to run the WFC2 rodent trapping lab in Darcey\u2019s class, that has been infamously known to run during field week!  This is SO exciting as it means you can still do this lab as part of your 2nd year program, and we are incredibly stoked about it.  Even though I\u2019m not your instructor for this course (literally so jealous! 🤣🤣🤣) we are all working together as one big team to find our supplies, and really have each other\u2019s backs!  I know things feel unknown right now, but I am looking forward to the challenge that awaits. I think this year is an opportunity to challenge the way things have normally been done, and it forces all of us to reflect on the way we live and learn. I look forward to taking on 2020-2021 with all of you, and turning this into the best year Lakeland college has ever had. Staying positive, I know we can do this! \n.\n.\n.\nWe literally are all in this together. #togetherness \n.\n.\n.\n#lakelandcollege @lakelandcollege #lakelandconnect #environmentalstudies #environmentcanada #environmentalconservation #environmentaleducation #environmentalscience #wfc #WFC2 #wildlifeandfisheriesconservation #school #lookahead #allinthistogether #COVID19 #socialdistance #stayingsafe #rodentlab #ecostudies","NumberOfLikes":15,"Hashtags":["#togetherness","#lakelandcollege","#lakelandconnect","#environmentalstudies","#environmentcanada","#environmentalconservation","#environmentaleducation","#environmentalscience","#wfc","#WFC2","#wildlifeandfisheriesconservation","#school","#lookahead","#allinthistogether","#COVID19","#socialdistance","#stayingsafe","#rodentlab","#ecostudies"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Sam MacKay on August 07, 2020.

Emotional stability has to do with recognizing and managing our feelings; having genuine compassion for others; maintaining meaningful healthy relationships; avoiding destructive patterns of behavior; loving others without having to change them; knowing our limits and weaknesses; resolving conflict maturely; learning to grieve. Being a human is not easy. Our experience here on Earth is different and complex for each one of us. On the other hand, spirituality doesn\u2019t have to do anything with obligation (contrary to popular belief). It has to do with the ability to ask our ourselves very important questions in regards to the life we are living and our actions. Becoming spiritually mature in life will not happen until we learn to develop a deeper sense of emotional health or intelligence.

This extreme heat is very bad for nature, animals, and even human beings...Climate change is a fact.\nI started taking photos of our life the day after my partner starts to work from home in March. He works in a company that is located in Brabant, which is the 'hot point' of the Covid-19 in The Netherlands. Most of the companies there ordered work from home even before The Prime Minister, Mark Rutte may advise working from home. As a Spanish living abroad, the whole situation has caused a big impact on our lives and our routines.\nAt the beginning of the intelligent lockdown, the pictures were in B&W. Because of some improvement around the whole Corona situation, the photos are now in color.
