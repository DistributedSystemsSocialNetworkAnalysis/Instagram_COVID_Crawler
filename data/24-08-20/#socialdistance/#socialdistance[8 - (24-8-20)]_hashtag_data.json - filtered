For crying out loud, the RB1 of a fire offense has an ADP of 7.11. You can\u2019t find too many starting backs with that ADP. \nI was a big fan of his coming out of college, but never drafted him. I had concerns about his catching ability, but he\u2019s improved upon that last year. Last season, he finished with 724 rushing yards off 172 carries and 6 TDs. He also hauled in 31 receptions (40 targets) and another 309 yards. I\u2019m all aboard the ROJO hype train.

In the yin-yang dichotomy, yin represents things that are slower and less aggressive. Often poses are held for several minutes, allowing the connective tissue to begin to release and creating a greater opening in the body. Props are used to support various parts of the body to make the poses easier to relax into.⠀\n.⠀\nYin yoga is the perfect compliment to a busy life because it forces you to really slow down. It can be mentally challenging for yogis who have trouble shutting their minds off, but practicing yoga asanas is all about finding a moving meditation and slowing down the thoughts moving through your consciousness. Sometimes a slow yin class is exactly what we need to move away from the crazy pace of modern life and to find stillness.⠀\n.⠀\nSign up for YIN tomorrow online at 6:30pm! ⠀\n🔸⠀\n🔸⠀\n🔸⠀\n#hotyoga #hotyogahouston #theoriginal #acceptnosubstitutes #ihp #infernohotpilates #socialdistance #virtualconnection #letsstaytogether","NumberOfLikes":15,"Hashtags":["#hotyoga","#hotyogahouston","#theoriginal","#acceptnosubstitutes","#ihp","#infernohotpilates","#socialdistance","#virtualconnection","#letsstaytogether"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Hot Yoga Houston on August 06, 2020.

This is the first time Facebook has taken down a post from the president for violating the company\u2019s policies on covid misinformation. In the removed video, president Trump can be heard in a phone interview saying schools should open. He goes on to say, \u201CIf you look at children, children are almost \u2014 and I would almost say definitely \u2014 but almost immune from this disease,\u201D and that they have stronger immune systems. Facebook previously deactivated dozens of ads placed by President Trump\u2019s reelection campaign that included a symbol once used by the Nazis to designate political prisoners in concentration camps.

I can\u2019t put into words how scared I was, it was definitely the sickest I\u2019ve ever been. Having many asthma attacks in my life and battling everyday asthma, nothing compared trying to breathe when you have COVID... the pain in my chest\/back was unbearable on top of ALL the other symptoms... also watching my husband and daughters just as sick and not being able to help them. COVID was in my home for a month so I thought... 16 weeks later I am not myself. I\u2019m tired all the time, I get winded fast, I can\u2019t sleep, muscle pain and now I\u2019m losing my hair.... the photos I\u2019m sharing are from each time I brush my hair, it does not include the hair in my shower, in my brush, on my pillow, on my clothes etc... My youngest daughter is experiencing the same hair loss. Apparently the harder the virus attacked your system the more symptoms and after effects you will experience... Many people are reporting hair loss 2-4 months after they had COVID 😞 Please be safe 🙏 \n.\n.\n.#covid19 #covidsymptoms #wearamask #mask #health #healthyliving #socialdistance #seriously #socialdistancing #covidmask #besafe #staysafe #staysafeeveryone #togetherwearestronger #together #life  #lifeduringcovid19 #deer #naturelovers #wildife #pandemiclife #pandemic #pandemicpreparedness #healthiswealth #covid #healthylifestyle #becareful #beresponsible #care #giveashit","NumberOfLikes":20,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#covidsymptoms","#wearamask","#mask","#health","#healthyliving","#socialdistance","#seriously","#socialdistancing","#covidmask","#besafe","#staysafe","#staysafeeveryone","#togetherwearestronger","#together","#life","#lifeduringcovid19","#deer","#naturelovers","#wildife","#pandemiclife","#pandemic","#pandemicpreparedness","#healthiswealth","#covid","#healthylifestyle","#becareful","#beresponsible","#care","#giveashit"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1596640393,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 05 17:13:13 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"navitheredhusky","CaptionText":"Remember what life was like before the pandemic?

The signature TUS sauce also compliments the rice and meat. They also include a poached egg which is always super delicious😺\n\nSpam Rice Bowl: 8\/10 I thought it was really good. Before when I dined in and had it I thought that the ratio of spam to rice was rlly good but this time there was slightly more spam than rice so it was a little saltier.

We miss the all of the wonderful people in Colombia, especially the smiling faces of the children we go there to serve. We miss getting to do construction to further the project that will one day be a home for 160 new kids. We miss our awesome volunteers who pour love into The Emiliani Project consistently. \n.\nCOVID-19 has changed a lot of our plans this year, but we are hopeful that normalcy will be established and we will be able to take continue having mission trips when it is safe to do so in the future. Please continue to pray for our organization and for the safety of the children we serve in Colombia. As always, if you feel led to donate, click the link in our bio.

Here are three tips! \n\n  1. The best seat on a plane? A window seat as far from the \n  restroom as possible (the harder part is keeping six feet \n  from others in airport lines). \n  2. Hotel tips? Confirm your hotel\u2019s cleaning protocols in \n  advance, avoid packed elevators, crowded reception \n  areas, and give high-touch surfaces a wipe down when \n  you arrive. \n  3. At restaurants, avoid peak times, eat on a patio six feet \n  from other diners, don\u2019t linger, and tip well (the last bit is \n  kindness advice, not health advice). \n\nDo you have any questions for me? \n\n#savoredmomentstravel #travelinspiration #keepdreaming #wewilltravelagain #wheretonext #togetherintravel #tourismstrong #travelsafe #socialdistance #naturalcraftphotography","NumberOfLikes":7,"Hashtags":["#savoredmomentstravel","#travelinspiration","#keepdreaming","#wewilltravelagain","#wheretonext","#togetherintravel","#tourismstrong","#travelsafe","#socialdistance","#naturalcraftphotography"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Savored Moments Travel on August 04, 2020.
