I still love Vaughn as a top tier handcuff in that offense and with his particular skillset, but ROJO being the RB1 easily means he\u2019s in for (at least) 15-20 carries a game and the lion share of the offensive series. For crying out loud, the RB1 of a fire offense has an ADP of 7.11. You can\u2019t find too many starting backs with that ADP. \nI was a big fan of his coming out of college, but never drafted him. I had concerns about his catching ability, but he\u2019s improved upon that last year. Last season, he finished with 724 rushing yards off 172 carries and 6 TDs. He also hauled in 31 receptions (40 targets) and another 309 yards. I\u2019m all aboard the ROJO hype train.

In the yin-yang dichotomy, yin represents things that are slower and less aggressive. Often poses are held for several minutes, allowing the connective tissue to begin to release and creating a greater opening in the body. Props are used to support various parts of the body to make the poses easier to relax into.‚†Ä\n.‚†Ä\nYin yoga is the perfect compliment to a busy life because it forces you to really slow down. It can be mentally challenging for yogis who have trouble shutting their minds off, but practicing yoga asanas is all about finding a moving meditation and slowing down the thoughts moving through your consciousness. Sometimes a slow yin class is exactly what we need to move away from the crazy pace of modern life and to find stillness.‚†Ä\n.‚†Ä\nSign up for YIN tomorrow online at 6:30pm! ‚†Ä\nüî∏‚†Ä\nüî∏‚†Ä\nüî∏‚†Ä\n#hotyoga #hotyogahouston #theoriginal #acceptnosubstitutes #ihp #infernohotpilates #socialdistance #virtualconnection #letsstaytogether","NumberOfLikes":15,"Hashtags":["#hotyoga","#hotyogahouston","#theoriginal","#acceptnosubstitutes","#ihp","#infernohotpilates","#socialdistance","#virtualconnection","#letsstaytogether"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Hot Yoga Houston on August 06, 2020.

Here are three tips! \n\n  1. The best seat on a plane? A window seat as far from the \n  restroom as possible (the harder part is keeping six feet \n  from others in airport lines). \n  2. Hotel tips? Confirm your hotel\u2019s cleaning protocols in \n  advance, avoid packed elevators, crowded reception \n  areas, and give high-touch surfaces a wipe down when \n  you arrive. \n  3. At restaurants, avoid peak times, eat on a patio six feet \n  from other diners, don\u2019t linger, and tip well (the last bit is \n  kindness advice, not health advice). \n\nDo you have any questions for me? \n\n#savoredmomentstravel #travelinspiration #keepdreaming #wewilltravelagain #wheretonext #togetherintravel #tourismstrong #travelsafe #socialdistance #naturalcraftphotography","NumberOfLikes":7,"Hashtags":["#savoredmomentstravel","#travelinspiration","#keepdreaming","#wewilltravelagain","#wheretonext","#togetherintravel","#tourismstrong","#travelsafe","#socialdistance","#naturalcraftphotography"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Savored Moments Travel on August 04, 2020.
