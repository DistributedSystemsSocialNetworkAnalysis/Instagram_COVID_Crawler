Bugs... ew. \n\nBUT since 2020 has been a crazy year as is, why not go exploring? It\u2019s been one of the few ways I get to leave my house while still #socialdistancing, and my extrovert self is desperate to see things other than the interior of my house, ya feel me? I\u2019ve spent a lot of time doing things outside of my comfort zone this year. Like anyone else, my life throughout the years has not been without SOME type of hard times, heartbreak, and hurt. In retrospect, I\u2019ve noticed that the MOST personal growth came from them. So this year, I decided to lean IN to the hard instead of hiding from it. I\u2019ve had times in life where it got hard and I wanted to run away. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of being a mom now, but my perspective has changed. It\u2019s given me a purpose to not only prove to myself that I can do hard things, but also to my daughter. I figure, I have two choices: devour life or get eaten alive from it. So this year I\u2019ve explored the unknowns, I\u2019ve tapped more into my creative side, and I\u2019ve embraced that life will be hard sometimes. And I\u2019m pretty excited to see what growth comes from it! \n.\nPS you can do hard things too, friend 😘\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#thegreatoutdoors #mentalhealth #extrovertproblems","NumberOfLikes":27,"Hashtags":["#socialdistancing,","#thegreatoutdoors","#mentalhealth","#extrovertproblems"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Angela on August 23, 2020.

It was a double-edged sword: it meant I could really have a rest, but it also meant financial stress.\u201D\n-\nWith weddings and other events cancelled, Cassie\u2019s business was stopped in its tracks, leaving Cassie both anxious and unsure about its future.\n-\n\u201CI just stopped doing anything creative for probably a month and a half. I\u2019m one of those personalities that goes to ground a little bit, I kind of slow right down and stop. Either the anxiety fuels you to be really productive or it just shuts you down.\u201D\n-\nIt gave her a chance to reflect for a while. \u201CI\u2019ve been going hard for so many years that I haven\u2019t really had that chance.\u201D\n-\nAs the pandemic continued, Cassie found herself being inspired by some of the global protests taking place. The Black Lives Matter movement \u2013 which saw a social-distancing event held in Hobart in early June - has inspired her to learn more about her indigenous heritage, an aspect of her identity she has explored in her art.\n-\n\u201CIt has renewed my focus to delve into my indigenous heritage. I made a promise to myself that I would start working really strongly with all the indigenous themes that had started to come through in my work.\u201D\n-\nDespite the financial stress, uncertainty and disruption to her creative process, Cassie believes that the social and cultural changes of this time will bring about opportunities and ideas.\n\ncontinued in comments...","NumberOfLikes":1,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598231008,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 24 03:03:28 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Having guests?

Wearing masks and #socialdistancing are good for #publichealth\n2. People who refuse to follow these rules are \u201Cdefectors\u201D who need to be \u201Cmorally enhanced\u201D\n3.

To absorb the full horror I suggest you read it for yourself (and then read the comment section as well, it will make you feel better) but, if you\u2019re not so inclined, here are some choice quotes:\n\n\u201C\u2026like receiving a vaccine to beef up your immune system, people could take a substance to boost their cooperative, pro-social behavior.\u201D\n\n\u201CMoral enhancement is the use of substances to make you more moral. The psychoactive substances act on your ability to reason about what the right thing to do is, or your ability to be empathetic or altruistic or cooperative.\u201D\n\n\u201CThese substances interact directly with the psychological underpinnings of moral behavior [\u2026] Then, perhaps, the people who choose to go maskless or flout social distancing guidelines would better understand that everyone, including them, is better off when they contribute, and rationalize that the best thing to do is cooperate.\u201D\n\n\u201C","NumberOfLikes":37,"Hashtags":["#coronavirus","#WesternMichiganUniversity,","#socialdistancing","#publichealth"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Nadia savage on August 23, 2020.

After lunch we came back to my place and had an icecream tasting party. I got a bunch of flavors from @lindsayshandmade (truly fresh unbelievable flavors). I gave everyone a scoop of all the flavors one by one with out telling them what the flavors were. We discussed the look and the possibility of the flavor. We then tasted and gave our opinions on what we thought it was. Then I revealed the flavor, it was so much fun. The number one flavor of the day was White Balsamic reduction Peach Sorbet( it was the perfect balance sweet fruit and acid balance of vinegar! ).We also tasted Chocolated frosted doughnut ( Lindsay steeps chocolate frosted doughnuts in the batter. Once the flavors are set up she mixes everything in a vanilla cream base. It's is beyond!!!!!) Sour Cherry goat cheese ( it's perfect combination of sweet, sour, creamy), Banana butterscotch swirl ( once you taste fresh bananas incream you'll never go back), fennel pineapple ( this was my favorite it was tropical, sweet, and savory ) then ending with straight fennel ( it's got a hint of anise and mint ).

I made the simple plan to go hang on the Gourdough\u2019s patio, order the Petunia, and paint a painting for the staff based on the idea they gave me. So upon me asking to paint on the patio, @pancho_slime comes out to greet me and see what I\u2019m up to and we came to the idea I will paint their best selling dinner item the \u201CCountry Clucker\u201D it is a large donut base, potato pancake, two piece chicken tenders, gravy cream corn with candies diced jalapeños garnish on top. Well I brought a limited color supply and ran out of white so I ended up painting a shit sandwich covered in corn 🤣🤣🤣🤣 we all had a good laugh over the happy little accident I made and I gave it to @pancho_slime  so it\u2019s his shit sandwich now. I was lavished with sweet spicy shots, light beer tall boys, and I was gifted a birthday donut for the troubles of coming for my birthday! I made new friends and had a kickass day. I lived a spontaneous day for my birthday and I wouldn\u2019t of changed a single detail. It was awesome. Plus I got front row parking!!!!

I first heard of this book from the Deliciously Ella podcast a few weeks ago, and have been wanting to read it for a while. So I started just now and am really enjoying it as I\u2019ve definitely been benefiting from being in nature, not just in terms of getting my physical activities in from all the walking, but also the impact it has on my mental health. How it has calmed me down recently, made me feel less anxious, especially during the lockdown, and I\u2019m feeling ever so grateful to have experienced and learnt how to appreciate that. Having spent most of my years in this country in Central London and further away from nature, it\u2019s definitely something I took for granted for years. \u2063\n\u2063\nThe book itself explores all of that and our relationship with the earth. Are we losing part of ourselves as we lose our bond with the natural world? And to put that into perspective with what\u2019s happening in the world right now, specifically the climate crisis, it\u2019s making me really nervous. \u2063\n\u2063\nThree chapters in, I\u2019m already loving this book, for how well-written and compelling it is.

Life and work of Charles Dickens;\n\"Any account of Dickens is inadequate.He is the greatest comic novelist in England; he is also the most truely poetic novelist.So far was we can lebal him at all, he was a fantasist, and he forces us to accept the world he creates by the sheer compelling power of the intensity of this imagination. It was an hallucinatory imagination and so long as he remains within the comic and satric or the melodramatic, he forces us to share the hallucination. His defects are many and yet they scarcely matter. He was a great original. He owned something, in this early books particularly, to the eighteenth century novelists-high spirits, the Joy in rough and rumble, the picaresque sequence of events; and these he transmitted to later novelist, to Wells, for instance, in 'Mr.Polly' . But he owed much more to himself. To find anything comparable in fiction to his own especial contribution to the novel, his sense of symbolism, the hallucinatory intensity of his imagination, the huge self- soliloquising monster he created, we have to go to Dosteyevsky and to a lesser degree, Kalka and James Joyce. As for his influence how can it be estimated? His work has become a part of the literary climate within which western man lives.\"#socialdistancing #soccer #so #socialmediamarketing","NumberOfLikes":12,"Hashtags":["#socialdistancing","#soccer","#so","#socialmediamarketing"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by #AmitGlobalEnterprises on August 23, 2020.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598215543,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 22:45:43 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Really wanting a nice cappuccino from Johnnys on this Monday! -\n-\n-\n-\n\n#baltimore #health #photography #photo #photooftheday #wellness #takecareofyourself #quarantine #socialdistancing #goodvibes #summer #summervibes #stayhome #staysafe #active #exercise #motivation #workout #healthylifestyle #lifestyle #food #foodphotography #foodie #best #bts #workoutmotivation #foodblogger #socialmediamarketing #social #camera","NumberOfLikes":20,"Hashtags":["#baltimore","#health","#photography","#photo","#photooftheday","#wellness","#takecareofyourself","#quarantine","#socialdistancing","#goodvibes","#summer","#summervibes","#stayhome","#staysafe","#active","#exercise","#motivation","#workout","#healthylifestyle","#lifestyle","#food","#foodphotography","#foodie","#best","#bts","#workoutmotivation","#foodblogger","#socialmediamarketing","#social","#camera"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Baltimores Best Eats in Johnny's with @johnnysbmore, @bmorefood, @liketheteaeats, @baltimorehomecook, @baltimoresbestfoods, and @baltimorefoodscene.

I have been reacting more than i've been reflecting. I found myself lashing out on my loved ones & losing my cool on petty things more than the usual recently and i guess all this stress got fueled up bcz since past few months i've been mostly staying indoors, working relentlessly online due to the pandemic. And no matter how hard i tried to distract nothing made me feel better. \n\n So i finally sat down and tried to introspect the triggers. Was it the people around me? Or was it me who was responsible for this feeling? . Finally i realized that the problem was that i've been having a hard time accepting basic things. When all this time I've been expecting ppl to accept me as I'm. Just like others i've been failing to reciprocate the same as well. It's pretty easy to share quotes about acceptance and self-acceptance on social media but it's pretty hard in reality to do the same. From qurantine overachivers, to social distancing violators , from fashion divas to even my own closed ones everyone seemed to be getting on my nerves bcz every time things didn't go as per my expectations or acc to what i felt. I had a hard time accepting others the way they were and including my own self. \n\nOn normal days also how many ppl we resent and wish to change, that one person who always leaves the door open, that overactive classmate ,that dominating colleague, or certain behavior of our family member that quirks us. But we can't always control the way somebody is. \n\nThe world is a complicated place full of diverse individuals all trying to make sense of what\u2019s going on around them. \nBut *you don't always have to be understanding, disrespectful or judgemental*  at times you just have to let ppl be and accept them as who they're without any thoughts attached. But it all starts with accepting yourself first and the person you chose to be in the future. \n\nBcz acceptance at times is the key to inner peace✨. \n\n#notetoself #reminders #sky #acceptance #letitbe #acceptance #heart","NumberOfLikes":19,"Hashtags":["#notetoself","#reminders","#sky","#acceptance","#letitbe","#acceptance","#heart"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1598211253,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 21:34:13 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"SUMMER SALE\u203C️Starts Today😎😏🎉🤑 40% OFF YOUR ENTIRE ORDER!!!
