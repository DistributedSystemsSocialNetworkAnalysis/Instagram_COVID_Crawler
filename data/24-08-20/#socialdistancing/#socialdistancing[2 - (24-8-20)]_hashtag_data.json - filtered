Best time ever! Skeet shooting and Archery! Never thought I\u2019d be able to do this. Second time holding a gun in my life! I hit the first skeet out of the machine. I give all the credit to Grayson my instructor. Then I actually hit 2 back to back. Even Tucker gave me the thumbs up from inside. Never have I been more excited! Next came Archery, hadn\u2019t done this before and after some amazing instruction from Alec I was hitting the bullseye! I was using a recurve bow. I highly, highly recommend The Chetola Sporting Reserve. How did I not know about this place before now! Can\u2019t wait to go back! So glad I could enjoy Mike\u2019s Birthday present.
