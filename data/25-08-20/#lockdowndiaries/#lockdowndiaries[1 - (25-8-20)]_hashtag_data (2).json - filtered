Allow each layer of ice cream to complete freeze before adding the next layer to avoid flavours mixing! We waited WAY longer than the 20 minutes called for - closer to 2 hours!\n2. A silicon cake pan is perfect to use as it makes the pie so easy to remove! \n\nFun fact üéÅ\nAs a Food Scientist one of my most memorable classes was the one where we learned about chocolate coating on the inside of ice cream cones sold ready to eat (like Drumsticks or Cornetto)üç¶. The coating is fat-based so forms a barrier that stops the moisture from the ice cream moving to the cone and making it soggy. It's essential to a good Drumstick or Cornetto. Those that first put them on the market spent tons of time and money on scientists üë©\u200Düî¨ to figure out a way to not let the chocolate pool at the bottom of the cone, only to find out after they did that people actually love the chocolate ends! üòÖ \n\n#buzzfeedtasty #cupcakeproject #bananasplitday #bananasplit #bananasplitpie #bananaspliticecreampie #icecream #pie #pies #homemadepie #homemadepies #icecreampie #neapolitan #neapolitanicecream #neopolitanicecreampie #caramelisedbanana #caramelisedbananas #caramelizedbananas #caramelizedbananas #icecream #dessert #desserts #f52gram #cookingstories2020 #cuisine_captures #f52grams #3rookiecooks #melbournefoodie #quaranteam #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":219,"Hashtags":["#nationalbananasplitday","#buzzfeedtasty","#cupcakeproject","#bananasplitday","#bananasplit","#bananasplitpie","#bananaspliticecreampie","#icecream","#pie","#pies","#homemadepie","#homemadepies","#icecreampie","#neapolitan","#neapolitanicecream","#neopolitanicecreampie","#caramelisedbanana","#caramelisedbananas","#caramelizedbananas","#caramelizedbananas","#icecream","#dessert","#desserts","#f52gram","#cookingstories2020","#cuisine_captures","#f52grams","#3rookiecooks","#melbournefoodie","#quaranteam","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":46,"Timestamp":1598361202,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 15:13:22 CEST 2020","Location":"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia"},{"Owner":"rigil_rvm","CaptionText":"Feeling my vibes right now.\n\nIsn't it lovely, how travelling heals your soul and mind. \n\n#idukki_stories #mypulsarofficial #traveltherapy #travelgram #lockdowndiaries #cloudporn #nature_perfection","NumberOfLikes":353,"Hashtags":["#idukki_stories","#mypulsarofficial","#traveltherapy","#travelgram","#lockdowndiaries","#cloudporn","#nature_perfection"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598361183,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 15:13:03 CEST 2020","Location":"Idukki"},{"Owner":"marianggala","CaptionText":"but there are times the best is no damn good ;p\n.\n.\n#sunsetwatching #whereiliveisbeautiful \n#lockdowndiaries #naturephotography \n#sunset #ForumSession #fotografiaunited #igers #nakakasenti","NumberOfLikes":6,"Hashtags":["#sunsetwatching","#whereiliveisbeautiful","#lockdowndiaries","#naturephotography","#sunset","#ForumSession","#fotografiaunited","#igers","#nakakasenti"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Mary Ann Burac on August 25, 2020.

I'm not surprised.\n\nI've  just finished the first episode of season two. There's a third season and, due to its great success, there might be a fourth season in the works. But already I'm thinking I don't want this to end.\n\nThe show title is the Danish word for \"castle\" or \"fortress\" and the story revolves around a female prime minister in the center of Denmark's coaliton politics dominated by brusque men. Expect a lot of bickering, backbiting, blackmailing, secrets, soul-selling, and sabotage but, rising above it all, also a lot of dignity and honor and integrity.\n\nThese two girls (@sidsebabettknudsen who plays Prime Minister Birgitte Nyborg and Birgitte Hjort S√∏rense who plays Katrine F√∏nsmark, a journalist) are among my favorites, though I think I am invested in the fate of everyone in the cast, including the PM's bumbling PA in season one, but especially @pilouasbaek, who plays the PM's spin doctor Kasper Juul, a character so especially nuanced, replete with a sensitive backstory.\n\nI watched the entire first season dubbed in English, but this first episode of season two I watched in Danish with English subtitles, but wow, I watched the latter on the edge of my seat and with my heart in my throat for all of 56 or so minutes!\n\nWas it because I watched it in its original language or was the episode just made so supercharged that even the distraction of reading the subtitles did not take away from the superb story and performance?\n\nEither way, bravo! \n\nThank you, Krip, for this quarantine gift. It's the equivalent of a vacation, set in Copenhagen and the surrounds, some scenes in Greenland even.\n\n#borgen\n#netflix \n#quarantinejournal\n#lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":19,"Hashtags":["#borgen","#netflix","#quarantinejournal","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by AA Patawaran in Manila, Philippines.

You have caused so many innocent people to lose their residence, jobs and even their precious lives.\nBUT.. I would like to thank you whole-heartedly for making me realise the actual value of life and self-worth. An epiphany striked me hard that, \"Money comes today and goes tomorrow\" but what ultimately matters the most is family and life. People may lose everything, but family is what which stands as a pillar of strength and support, during the period of a crisis or a pandemic.\n If you haven't existed now, I would have been working somewhere far away from my home, waiting desperately to come back. But now because of you, I got to some beautiful quality time with my loved ones, and I'm ever so grateful to you for this.\n You have given me a much needed break in my life to discover my obscure potential and talents, which would have remained unrecognised without you. I am glad that you came into my life as a source of determining self-worth and self-realisation, and I'm truly indebted to you for letting me obtain a clear perception of myself that, contentment and bliss lies in my own peace and solace.\n\nYours dearly,\nHaniya.\n.\n@theyellowjar\n\n#lockdown #inkedstoriesxfeature #lockdown2020 #lockdownlife #lockdowndiaries #letters #openletters #writingsociety #writingcommunity #writersofinstagram #writers #writersoninstagram #igwritersclub #igwriters #writersofig #writersnetwork #poetsandwriters #societyofwriters #writerdiaries #writings #writingletters #wordsofcaramel #writingcommunityofinstagram #scribbling #scribbles #penningdown #penningdownthemind #lockdownlifeüîê #theyellowjarprompts","NumberOfLikes":97,"Hashtags":["#lockdown","#inkedstoriesxfeature","#lockdown2020","#lockdownlife","#lockdowndiaries","#letters","#openletters","#writingsociety","#writingcommunity","#writersofinstagram","#writers","#writersoninstagram","#igwritersclub","#igwriters","#writersofig","#writersnetwork","#poetsandwriters","#societyofwriters","#writerdiaries","#writings","#writingletters","#wordsofcaramel","#writingcommunityofinstagram","#scribbling","#scribbles","#penningdown","#penningdownthemind","#lockdownlifeüîê","#theyellowjarprompts"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Haniya Azfar ü¶ã on August 24, 2020 tagging @theyellowjar.

This year due to Pandemic the Ganesh Chaturthi celebration remains a bit low in profile. \nAs a kid I always use to celebrate this festival with so much enthusiasm. \n.\n.\nThis year's festival is special to me because for the very first time I made Bappa's favourite Ukadiche Modak. They weren't as perfect as it's done by using a mould but I enjoyed while making. I made these with shradha in my mind for Bappa. I don't think the shape and size matters infront of the shraddha which makes prasad heaven. \n.\n.\nWe know that Ganpati Bappa is like a friend so he will accept my modaks...\n(Oh my friend Ganesha tu rehena sath humesha)\n.\n.\nI really want to visit Maharashtra at time of Ganesh Utsav to see the happiness that joy in people.\n.\n.\nIn Odisha we celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi a bit different. Like we offer God Boondi Laddoo and  Chudaghasa ( means Chivda powdered with sugar and bit of cardamom) prasad mixed with boondi , sev and fruits.

I also tidy up my entire plastic model collection. I now have a sizable PlaMo wall. I now have a total of 130 kits counting the add ons(65 Bandai and Kotobukiya kits, 65 Bootleg kits). As much as I want to use this as my background for my online classes, my parents thought it wouldn't send a good message to anyone who'd see. So I had to clean them up and set up an angle of my room where they would see my small bookshelf instead of my boxes. I strongly believe this would show that I'm doing my own art that is different from my writing. I believe that PlaMo building in itself is a form of art and performance. I know I'm not doing any recolors or drastic color change on my kits but I'm getting there. I'd just have to invest on a small compressor and airbrush set and I'll be ready. I've been planning to do so but some things don't always go your way. Still, this clean up allowed me to look into my hobby not just as a hobby but a lifestyle; something that you have to invest time and resources in order to be good at. Salute to my fellow builders out there! \nFor now, allow me to put these boxes back.\n.\n.\n.\n#abuilderslife\n#plamobuilder \n#plasticmodels \n#gunpla \n#gunplabuilder \n#gunplaislyf \n#gundamsofinstagram\n#bandai\n#kotobukiya\n#zoids\n#zoidsofinstagram\n#happykid\n#lockdown \n#lockdowndiaries \n#stayhome \n#stayhealthy","NumberOfLikes":14,"Hashtags":["#abuilderslife","#plamobuilder","#plasticmodels","#gunpla","#gunplabuilder","#gunplaislyf","#gundamsofinstagram","#bandai","#kotobukiya","#zoids","#zoidsofinstagram","#happykid","#lockdown","#lockdowndiaries","#stayhome","#stayhealthy"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Simon Pablo Reyes Felismino in Marikina City.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598101695,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 15:08:15 CEST 2020","Location":"Marikina City"},{"Owner":"bijoyrocks28","CaptionText":"#lockdowndiaries #foodstagram #chickensofinstagram #findingjoy","NumberOfLikes":10,"Hashtags":["#lockdowndiaries","#foodstagram","#chickensofinstagram","#findingjoy"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Bijoy in ‡¶ï‡ßã‡¶®‡ßç‡¶®‡¶ó‡¶∞.

And I often end up pushing them away by this behaviour. \n\nI'm often told that I'm overreacting, that this is my strategy to shut them up, or a way to blackmail them to get things done my way. And that angers me even more.\n\nI've always been a short tempered, impatient and impulsive person, but I didn't know that it could come out in ways like these. It also leads to feelings of guilt and shame for lashing out on people that I love the most and making them go through hell. But I don't know how to help it.\n\nI'm trying though. I'm taking baby steps. Like taking deep breaths as soon as I see my temper rising, meditating, and exercising. It isn't easy but I'll get there.\n\nI'm putting this out here solely because I'm sure many of you are facing similar situations, where people around you are unable to understand what you're going through. This is to tell you that it's okay if people don't get you. It doesn't matter. What matters is for you to realise and accept that there is something that you need to do to break the cycle, and change those unhealthy behaviours.\n\nIt's not going to be easy. And it's not going to happen overnight. But it'll happen. The only person who needs to have faith in you is YOU. And all you gotta do is take baby steps, and you'll get there. \n\nWhenever I feel caged, I go to my terrace, put on some Frank Sinatra tunes, and enjoy the sunset. I see numerous birds flying around in the sky like they have no worries. And sometimes, I wish I was one. \n\nWhat do you do when you feel suffocated?

His family is a survivor of the war in Vietnam, distorted fragments of which is seen in what follows their survival. For a story this short, the topics branched bears quite some weight.\n\nOcean Vuong explores language on both a micro and macro level. A sense of poetry flows down in the writing (not surprising considering Ocean Voung is widely popular for his poems!), streaming across subjects of sexuality, race, gender, masculinity, grief and language. \n\nPlease give this a read.

This pandemic devastated many industries including the realm of fashion, but we say no to a curtain call. Many fashion designers, fashion entrepreneurs and everyone involved in this industry deviated from their usual jobs and devised other ways to make ends meet and sustain their livelihood. Despite a dire situation, benevolent hearts within the fashion circle lent a helping hand by organizing donation drives for the less privileged communities and created protective suits and facemasks for our frontliners. \nIn support to this industry, I will promote businesses, encourage consumers, patronize services and participate in advocacies of protecting and saving lives. Being essential will always be fashionable and I AM ESSENTIAL in protecting this industry. I CAN PROTECT one's sustenance, I am #ProFashion and #ProLife.

We\u2019ve come back from Oxford at the time and decided to have dinner before heading back home.\n\nWent down Kings Cross and saw the canal side (Coal Drops Yard way) packed with people without social distancing and face coverings. It seemed just like an ordinary Friday, as if the pandemic was already long forgotten. \n\nSuddenly felt a bit panicky and almost didn\u2019t want to go through with dinner. I just wanted to go home. But the hunger games were tight, and the though of having to cook after a long journey had more appeal than baloney. So we ended up in one of my favourites of the Caprice Holdings franchises, @granarysquarebrasserie. At least, I thought, the food will be good.\n\nThe tables were fairly distanced and they had amazing hand sanitiser spray on each one. Service worked seamlessly although I wish staff would wear face shields. The place was busy but it wasn\u2019t so overwhelming.\n\nFor an hour and a half, the experience was a welcome respite - cocooned in our corner booth, we were safe from what was outside.\n\nIf anything, one of my takeaways from the pandemic is that it\u2019s changed my perception of socialising. As an extrovert, it shocked me how much I just wanted to stay local, or remote. I know we\u2019ve already been out to eat at local places, but it still felt surreal to be out in London again. I get weird anxious feelings about being in \u201Cbusy\u201D places (and that\u2019s usually the \u201Cquiet\u201D standard in normal times).\n\nI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll go away sooner than later. But does anyone else feel like this, too?

And this lovely Poster was created by me putting all the pics together.  The Positivity Video was also put together by me, with a Script written by Prochy Mistry and conceptualized with the help of all our SJK girls, Anjali Asudani, and our Pinkies, Vandana Mahajan, Nivedita Nihalaney Ruth Miranda Veronica Dcunha, with Prochy Master giving the final Voice over and me in the beginning.  The other girls in the video are Hiral Shah, Divya Venkateswaran Rupali Rohit Goshalia, Kala Lakra, Menaka Padmanabhan Sunke, Nidhi Mody and Lipika Savalkar.  A Big THANK YOU to Milind Soman  and Reema Sanghavi for this wonderful initiative which helped all our SJK girls to display their various talents.  And of course to Vaishnavi Naik and her USF Team for putting it all together so beautifully.  This has been a real Labour of Love and the end result has been worth it.

You get to see the die hard jogger, the dawn shift construction workers already at the only cafe that\u2019s open, the lone bus driver who nods at you, sometimes a bakery with warm rolls...and if you are really lucky...an early morning meeting of the dog walkers club, with the dogs, of course:) That morning in Edinburgh, I walked the Royal Mile at dawn. My teeth chattering in the cold, the gloves feeling like cellophane and my Jack Wolfskin the only reason I am alive to write this. I saw a sign heading off to a close or a Kloos, as the Scots say, to the right of the Royal Mile. I wanted to walk straight on to the castle, but I\u2019m so glad I took the detour. That was the view down the long dark corridor. The rewards truly are off the beaten path. But it was the sign that led to it, that I simply couldn\u2019t resist.

It is a real charmer when dressed up with homemade thick custard and piped, chantilly cream. It adds an honest flavour with its rich sweetness and spongy caramelised texture, suggestive of a splendid dessert. Doubly so, it can be quietly savored at tea time. \n.\nServed with a superior vanilla ice cream, this should clinch the deal for a refreshing summery dessert. This swoony South African classic never becomes outdated.
