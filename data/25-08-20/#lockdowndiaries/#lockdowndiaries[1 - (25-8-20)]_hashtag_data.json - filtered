Pour milk and cream into a saucepan and mix the sugar along, until it's dissolved.\nSet the saucepan over low heat and warm the milk gently, stirring or whisking frequently.\nDO NOT BOIL ! ❌\n2. Once the sugar has dissolved, add vanilla essence and the flavour. Stir this mixture.\n3. Add the gelatin to the saucepan and stir until the gelatin is dissolved.\n4. Strain the mixture and pour it into your ramekins.\n5. Keep the ramekins in normal temperature for 30min and then refrigerate for 5-hours or overnight.( Tip : The longer,the better ) 😉\n6. Run a thin knife carefully around the sides of a ramekin. Dip the ramekin in the warm water up to its rim, and hold it there for about 3 seconds.\nInvert the ramekin over the plate and shake gently to help it fall out. \n\nAnd Ta-Da, your panna-cotta is ready to be served ! 🤗\n\n#pannacotta #pineaplleflavoured #dessert #dessertsofinstagram #vegandesserts #homemade #lockdowndiaries #lockdowncooking #happiness #lovefordessertmaking #food #foodporn","NumberOfLikes":33,"Hashtags":["#pannacotta","#pineaplleflavoured","#dessert","#dessertsofinstagram","#vegandesserts","#homemade","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdowncooking","#happiness","#lovefordessertmaking","#food","#foodporn"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1598289384,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 24 19:16:24 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"chhoti_diary","CaptionText":"Lockdown Diaries! \nThis exhibition brought back many memories of last few months.

It is the kind of food that you can rustle together using pantry staple spices, caramelized onions, ginger and garlic paste and ready on your table in less than 40 minutes. You could propel the curry with the welcome addition of most vegetables, most commonly exploited are, gravy-soaking potatoes or tender green peas. \n.\nThere are very willing ways to serve this curry, fluffy cumin basmati rice, soft rotis or scrumptious garlic naan breads to scoop up the spicy gravy. The spiced curry is mellow and relaxed, it\u2019s imbued flavours rooted in culture, deepening over time. \n.\nPerfect when shared with good company, forget the cutlery and go fingers in. \n.\nThis recipe is from my paperback cookbook - Cooking Memorable Food with Paz, to shop, tap the link in bio\n.\nFollow @foodiesof_cakewalk for more photos and ideas\/recipes.

That nespresso pod happens to be my favourite colour, I think!\nTo me, Tire lizié is the action of going to an elder matriarch (my mom or grand mother) and ask them to pass salt around my head 7 times. It is an extremely personal moment between my grandma and myself. I tend to do it when I\u2019ve had chronic headaches, anxiety attacks or just a feeling of malaise! To be very honest, I\u2019m sure that it isn\u2019t very Islamic, it is rather more cultural. Nazar 🧿 or evil eye is an Islamic concept though, we acknowledge the evil from envy, jealousy or ill wishing. In islam you would rather protect yourself through prayers than other acts. \nThe Nazar isn\u2019t limited to Islamic cultures or countries, it is a greatly respected within Turkey, Greece, Cyprus and many other middle eastern countries.\nThe important discussion though, isn\u2019t if you believe in it or not. Rather, it is about whether you are open to people who have other beliefs than you. Can you make this world a safe space for them and their practices.

This year due to Pandemic the Ganesh Chaturthi celebration remains a bit low in profile. \nAs a kid I always use to celebrate this festival with so much enthusiasm. \n.\n.\nThis year's festival is special to me because for the very first time I made Bappa's favourite Ukadiche Modak. They weren't as perfect as it's done by using a mould but I enjoyed while making. I made these with shradha in my mind for Bappa. I don't think the shape and size matters infront of the shraddha which makes prasad heaven. \n.\n.\nWe know that Ganpati Bappa is like a friend so he will accept my modaks...\n(Oh my friend Ganesha tu rehena sath humesha)\n.\n.\nI really want to visit Maharashtra at time of Ganesh Utsav to see the happiness that joy in people.\n.\n.\nIn Odisha we celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi a bit different. Like we offer God Boondi Laddoo and  Chudaghasa ( means Chivda powdered with sugar and bit of cardamom) prasad mixed with boondi , sev and fruits. It's different from Modak.\nBut this time I offered Bappa his favourite Modak which made me happy from inside.\n.\n.\nAnd yes this is my contribution to #ganeshchaturthiincovid.

From trying to experience as many cultures as possible to looking inwards, remembering forgotten projects and reviving them. \nHaving understood the value of homegrown organic produce a couple of years ago, I was keen to get a little patch going, except for the problem of who would look after it when we traveled. \nBut then came the lockdown -- giving me all the time in the world, and nowhere to go as far as one could see. \nSo I started planting. \nThis little tree, part of a larger \"kitchen garden\" that has miraculously survived despite me, is giving us the most fragrant organic limes I have ever experienced. \nNature showed us her very best; everything that was sowed, took root and thrived without a single chemical being applied. Salads, tomatoes, radish greens, guavas, herbs, mirchis, even a couple of tiny but determined baingan plants valiantly pushing through.... I'm honestly struck by how easy it's been, and how very very rewarding! We now not only have little bits and bobs that make their way into our plates, but also a tiny green patch in the concrete jungle of Gurgaon, for when nerves need calming and minds need centering. #gratitude\n\nOh, and thank you @divaliciousdoc\nFor tagging me #newnormal \n\nHere's hoping to see more perspectives on the New Normal and what it has brought with it:  Tagging @sonataparashar @roytellstales @firepowernaik\n@rilanty\n@shredmatic\n@winter_wanderer\n@shrenikavlani @deeptidhoot \n\n.\n.\n#organicfarming #eatorganic #farmtotable #lockdowndiaries #enjoythelittlethings #deliciousfeeling #makethemostofit","NumberOfLikes":60,"Hashtags":["#gratitude","#newnormal","#organicfarming","#eatorganic","#farmtotable","#lockdowndiaries","#enjoythelittlethings","#deliciousfeeling","#makethemostofit"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Insiyah Vahanvaty on August 22, 2020.

Discovering life;stuck in between 4 walls and one single roof 24*7 !! Pheww!!\nThough being a homemaker I have experiences in managing a home, nurturing my life around it. But this time it wasn't easy. Initially it was going okay and slowly the monotony creeped in. \nThe usual everyday chores seemed super boring and exhausting as well. Without having a help the chores were divided between me and hubby and we still are continuing!!\nThe changes were inevitable. The pandemic, the lockdown has helped me to recentre my being. Helped me to focus, concentrate. Yes there are days when I do not feel okay. I get severely anxious. Yes I do. But unlike before now I can control. I believe in my patience. I strongly feel time will heal everything. \nOn the brighter side, I started spending time on my hobbies more. And I found out I have not one but many hobbies to indulge in!!\nCooking is my all time breather but I have rediscovred my love for painting, gardening. \nSo the lockdown has been quite a challenge but also a boon in disguise !!🤞🏻\nTo sum it up my life in Pandemic has been difficult but learnt few important life lessons. And I am grateful for this life.\nThank You. 🙏🏻\nLove,\nDebarati\n#makeoveifestylestories #mls #lockdowndiaries #mlsadminspeaks #MakeoverLifestyleStories #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":14,"Hashtags":["#makeoveifestylestories","#mls","#lockdowndiaries","#mlsadminspeaks","#MakeoverLifestyleStories","#pandemic2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Makeover, Lifestyle, Stories on August 22, 2020.

Two of my favourite novels of all time are \u2018To the Lighthouse\u2019 - sublime, elegiac; and \u2018Orlando\u2019 - hilarious, audacious, wise. But it\u2019s Virginia Woolf\u2019s diaries I return to again and again as to an old friend for comfort and delight, dipping in and out and never needing to read in chronological order. The way she wrestles with her work, her moods, her tricky balance between social obligations and solitary vocation; the cyclical nature of all things. \n\nTo watch a mind watching itself here is magic. \n\nThis ancient book is particularly precious to me because I\u2019m such a sentimental sap. @markustone found it in a secondhand bookstore in Clunes five ago and said, \u2018Hey, how about this? You like her don\u2019t you?\u2019 \nAnd I pounced upon it immediately, having never read her diaries before. It\u2019s old and battered, and because I\u2019ve loved it so well the cover was coming off. And now he has mended it and covered it with contact and it\u2019s rescued! True love, despite the fact he\u2019s never really cared to read much of her work himself 😆. \n\nI love how In this excerpt photographed VW is thoroughly sick of herself, and even of that beautiful book Orlando; how she detests her own \u2018volubility\u2019. She makes me laugh. \n#lockdownhappinessproject #photoaday #melbournelockdownroundtwo #virginiawoolf #diaries #lockdowndiaries #writersofinstagram","NumberOfLikes":40,"Hashtags":["#lockdownhappinessproject","#photoaday","#melbournelockdownroundtwo","#virginiawoolf","#diaries","#lockdowndiaries","#writersofinstagram"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1598069855,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 06:17:35 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"anandg408","CaptionText":"#festivalsofindia #sacrificialfire #havan #ganpatibappamorya 🙏🙏🙏 #india #lockdowndiaries #mumbaidiaries #samsungnote10 #samsunggalaxy #samsungphotography","NumberOfLikes":8,"Hashtags":["#festivalsofindia","#sacrificialfire","#havan","#ganpatibappamorya","#india","#lockdowndiaries","#mumbaidiaries","#samsungnote10","#samsunggalaxy","#samsungphotography"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Anand G on August 21, 2020.

A garden where I can grow lavender and rhubarb and so much more. To once again be able to play a piano, my own piano, learning new songs for no other purpose than my love for the instrument. To establish my own little office, no longer working from an awkward combination of couch\/bed\/coffee table and more.

I know very few people who were truly happy with what they achieved during lockdown. Now it\u2019s easing, the guilt & blame for not writing the book, redecorating the house, knitting a combine harvester, is huge. Society puts so much pressure on us to achieve, & to keep raising the bar, it can feel so overwhelming & make us feel at the bottom of the heap.\n\nLockdown was unlike anything any of us had ever experienced, everything was different, unknown, scary & very limiting in so many ways. Personally, just getting through it was achievement enough, managing to have some semblance of normal life was a major achievement. Now we are faced with an easing, but also a constant change of rules & doing things. Many people are feeling a bit stuck, not really able to get going, feel motivated & are struggling to focus.\n\nWe really should be allowed to take into account how much harder it is to do normal everyday tasks. Meeting up with friends... a minefield! Are we supposed to? Are we being irresponsible? Are bubbles still a thing, how do I manage that? Am I going to get told off, fined a ton of money, catch the virus? It wasn\u2019t like this before, now we have a lot of things to navigate.\n\nWe should start by letting ourselves off the hook a little, & celebrate getting any task done, if we do manage to do something productive, congratulate ourselves & make it as big as we can.\n\nIf we can allow it to be the case, that it\u2019s much harder now doing anything out there, maybe we can shorten our to do lists a bit & do a little dance every time we change the bed or send an email.\n\nI\u2019m doing a little dance as soon as I\u2019ve finished writing this. Having set out twice to go to the shops & have to come back because I forgot my face mask, things take longer & are more frustrating. Celebrate your wins, no matter how big or small!\n\nHas anyone else been struggling to stay motivated?","NumberOfLikes":23,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Mental Health Providers in London, United Kingdom.

The house of Camera \n\nIndia Photo Archive Foundation, Museo Camera and Dahuez began the #LockDownDiaries a few weeks into the lockdown to gather images and give everyone a platform to share moments while all were in isolation and confined to our homes. It was the little things that everyone started paying attention to - the blossoming of flowers, the clear skies, the call of the newspaperman every morning, the variety of birds flying around us or even the steam coming out of a hot cup of tea in the mornings.\n\nThe Lockdown Diaries is not a photo contest, it\u2019s a journal of our times. \n\nIn the words of the Founder Director of Museo Camera, Aditya Arya, \u2018Photographers are visual historians who are creating visual stories which future academicians are going to use as important source material\u201D. Many have started picking up their cameras to document some of these small, seemingly insignificant and significant moments of everyday life under lockdown.\n\nThe exhibition will be open from 11am-7pm 7 days a week. All precautions are being taken to ensure everyones safety. \n\nMasks are mandatory inside the museum. Your temperature will be checked at the main entrance, we request you to please cooperate with the team for this.","NumberOfLikes":148,"Hashtags":["#LockDownDiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Aditya Arya in Museo camera.

There is a water tank on the right as you enter through the door. On the left you can see the ramparts. Going up from here, there is a temple of Mahadev in front. There is a big moat behind the temple. After traverse it, we reach the place of the flagpole. Tung, Lohgad, Visapur, Bhatrashi hill, Morse's hill, Jambuli's hill, Pavane area and Phagane dam are all visible from the fort.\n\n@virajt_dd11 and Me 😉\n\n#sahyadri_ig #maharashtra_forts #durg_naad\n#lonavala #trekking_adventure #pawanmaval #mountains #tikonafort #sahyadrichi_bhatkanti #chatrapatishivajimaharaj #durg_vede #hikingtrails #chatrapati_sambhajimaharaj #hikersofinstagram #googlepixel #gopro #maharashtra_igers #swarajya #trekdiaries #mountainlove #trekkers_of_sahyadri #maharashtrian_treasures #hikewithpk #mountainview #sahyadrichamavla #sahyadrimountainrange #lockdowndiaries #trekkinglife⛰️🏕️🏔️❤️✌️","NumberOfLikes":70,"Hashtags":["#sahyadri_ig","#maharashtra_forts","#durg_naad","#lonavala","#trekking_adventure","#pawanmaval","#mountains","#tikonafort","#sahyadrichi_bhatkanti","#chatrapatishivajimaharaj","#durg_vede","#hikingtrails","#chatrapati_sambhajimaharaj","#hikersofinstagram","#googlepixel","#gopro","#maharashtra_igers","#swarajya","#trekdiaries","#mountainlove","#trekkers_of_sahyadri","#maharashtrian_treasures","#hikewithpk","#mountainview","#sahyadrichamavla","#sahyadrimountainrange","#lockdowndiaries","#trekkinglife⛰️🏕️🏔️❤️✌️"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597852949,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 19 18:02:29 CEST 2020","Location":"Tikona"},{"Owner":"sreehari_sreemangalam","CaptionText":"💚 #gogreen #lockdowndiaries #lockdown #love #lost #instagood #fun","NumberOfLikes":186,"Hashtags":["#gogreen","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdown","#love","#lost","#instagood","#fun"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by SReeHaRisS on August 19, 2020.

To call it a \u201Cwriter\u2019s block\u201D would be reductive; it is existential crisis, as we know it. In that sense, the lockdown has been a blessing, allowing me to express myself in a different way (for what is art if not a form of expression?). It has also served as a steady reminder, that I am more than the words I speak\/write. And so, despite well-meaning and sardonic comments alike on how I\u2019ve been \u201Ccooking a lot these days,\u201D I keep going on, simply because it is another conduit for the imaginings and imaginations within me. Using leftover crispy smashed potatoes from last night\u2019s dinner as the base for a quick papeta par edu-like dish for lunch, kind of gives me the same joy I would derive from restructuring a sentence to make more sense, or express better the things I am trying to say.

It has to be done to keep this country safe and I am 100% behind it. With that said, I had plans to visit my family back in Australia for my birthday at the end of this month, which I, of course, had to cancel when borders closed.  I was sad about it but moved forward and made other great plans with some truly special friends here. I believe in making the best out of situations that don't always go your way. So here I am all excited for a weekend of fun with friends and now we are back in lockdown and not coming out in time for those plans. I know the entire world is also being impacted by COVID and that I am not alone in this type of situation. I am trying really hard not to pity myself.  I had my afternoon of sulking and have now moved on again. I am taking this as a message from my ancestors and the universe that I need to use the time off that I was going to spend celebrating and stay home and get my work done.  I will have about a week off from work and will not be able to leave unless accessing essential services.  What does this mean? Seven consecutive days where I can focus all of my energy on my art, projects, and any other aspect of my business that needs tending to.  Instead of being sad, I am trying to be appreciative of the time and a safe and comfortable home to be able to focus and accomplish tasks towards my goals. But to be honest, deep down I'm still a bit sad about the cancelled party plans.\n\nHow has COVID impacted your life? How are you getting through these times?
