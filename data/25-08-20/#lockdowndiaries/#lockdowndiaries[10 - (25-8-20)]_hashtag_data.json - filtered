So concepts like planning, management, and scheduling are not very welcome in the domestic environment. \nEven when we are subconsciously doing all of it, we keep it that way. Not conscious. \n\nBut 24 hours of home time with limited access to space, people and resources makes you look at things differently. Few days into lockdown most people wanted to figure out a way to make this new life work better. It was time to invite management skills home. \n\nIt all started with schedules and lists to get a sense of routine, avoid feeling lost and give clarity. Mental, digital or a few scribbled buckets of checklists - things to buy, people to call, shows to watch, books to read, cleaning list, the work list, food menu and so on. What to cook during the week determined the shopping list, budget, refrigerator space, choice of chef, kitchen duties, meal time and work schedule. It called for serious planning. \n\nConfined to indoors, physical activity took a beating. Eating became a prominent form of recreation. Managing health, fitness and weight was an obvious entry into the checklist and a top priority to many. \n\nThe lockdown was the balancing act. Between office, home and socialising time. Between chores and leisure. Between the must-do list and the wishlist. Between me time and family time. Between physical activity and screen time. Kids online class time and office work meeting time. \nIt was no just about managing the time. There were people, spaces, devices and mindspace to be managed too. Every resource was precious and needed attention and thought. \n\nBut nothing beats the complexity of managing relationships. The lockdown gave birth to new expectations. Playing a spouse, parent, guardian, child, sibling, friend, colleague, partner, professional or a lover in a confined space or from a distance was maddening. \n\nThe intrinsic management skill gifted by nature were put to best use, perhaps for the very first time. It wasn't about winning anyway, it was about trying. \n\nHow did you manage your days and weeks during lockdown? \nShare your stories.\n\n \n\n#lockdowninsights #behaviouralchange #newnormal","NumberOfLikes":2,"Hashtags":["#lockdowninsights","#behaviouralchange","#newnormal"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1594454292,"LocalDate":"Sat Jul 11 09:58:12 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"arun_prasad_cr","CaptionText":"Sheera Kesari 😋 #homemadefood#lockdowncooking#lockdowndiaries#mumbaifoodlovers#","NumberOfLikes":14,"Hashtags":["#homemadefoo","#lockdowncookin","#lockdowndiarie","#mumbaifoodlover"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ♥ArUn ♥PrAsAd ♥Cr in Thakurli, India.

We played Canasta, got our fairy lights plugged in and I was in charge of music (sample pictured). Lockdown Tournament score is 23\u201317 for Roommate. When the power came on again around 6:30 pm, the Internet stayed down. I had my dongle. This is fine. I then made my recipe box: Potato gnocchi with burnt sage butter. Oh em god. Perfect winter dish!

The gyms will be opening 25th July, and while this is a good thing for most of us, there may be a few of you that are a bit nervous. And that\u2019s okay. I personally won\u2019t be going to the gym straight away as I live with my family (there\u2019s 5 of us) and 3 of them are \u2018at risk\u2019 (and I still haven\u2019t been to the pub yet either). But here\u2019s a few tips for when we do go back...\n➡️start slow - I bet the 25th July will be like January at the gym and will constantly be busy. That means it might be worth waiting a few days before you go back, and I know my gym will have live tracking on the app to see how busy it is before you go (which is a fab tool anyway)\n➡️don\u2019t expect to be where you were before - it\u2019s likely that you will have lost at least a bit of strength over lockdown (and that\u2019s okay) so don\u2019t go in ready to deadlift your PB, especially if you haven\u2019t had access to any weights throughout lockdown. Instead, go for form over weights for a few weeks until you get back into it\n➡️get prepared - (I can help soon) maybe you want to get your fitness level back to where it used to be, so use this time to utilise getting form right with little\/no weight and then you can add it on in a few weeks, that way, you\u2019ll be less likely to get an injury\n➡️get excited - I know so many of us have been waiting for the date that we can get back to the gym, and we finally have it!!\n➡️take care - the gyms have been closed for a while, so be careful with your workouts and also look after yourself and others by following the gyms after guidelines (I know my gym have emailed me there\u2019s and I\u2019m sure you can find things on their website or social media)\n.\nWhat tips do you have for returning back to the gym??💖\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#lockdown #lockdown2020 #lockdownlife #lockdowndiaries #lockdownfun #gymsareopen #backtothegym #gymsoon #tips #tipsandtricks #advice #adviceoftheday #lifeadvice #gymadvice #mytips #toptip #toptiptuesday #toptips #adviceforlife #fitnessadvice #thanksboris #fridayvibes #friday #fridaymood #lockdownmood #fridaymotivation #motivation #feelingmotivated #readytogotothegym #gymready","NumberOfLikes":34,"Hashtags":["#lockdown","#lockdown2020","#lockdownlife","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdownfun","#gymsareopen","#backtothegym","#gymsoon","#tips","#tipsandtricks","#advice","#adviceoftheday","#lifeadvice","#gymadvice","#mytips","#toptip","#toptiptuesday","#toptips","#adviceforlife","#fitnessadvice","#thanksboris","#fridayvibes","#friday","#fridaymood","#lockdownmood","#fridaymotivation","#motivation","#feelingmotivated","#readytogotothegym","#gymready"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Fitness, Health And Wellness in Birmingham, United Kingdom.

It was also freezing and rainy and I had a meeting at 9:00. I find this to be too early. I got my dry shampoo involved, but eventually didn\u2019t switch on my camera and mostly stayed on mute as I had rusks and fruit for breakfast. It was mostly a listening meeting for me until about 5 minutes before the end. I made us snackwiches for lunch again and read a bit to @grumpygont after work. How far behind are you now, Carla!? I\u2019m on 45% of 1Q84. Maybe I\u2019ll finish it in 2021 when lockdown is over.\nRoommate was annoyed with 401 stomping around all day and almost thought he wanted alone time. But he was wrong. He needed to win at Canasta. I didn\u2019t let him win, but that and a whisky cheered him up. We watched some New Girl, had wine and I cooked my famous fauxsotto (but this time we didn\u2019t have soy sauce for my shiitake facon, so I used Teriyaki sauce that arrived that day and we also mixed in an avo. Weird but nice.) We then watched some Killing Eve and then I read my book. Fell asleep earlier than usual and applied earplugs just in cases. The whole night I kept thinking: I\u2019m sleeping like a rock! So I took out the earplugs. The success continued. Not sure what the magic trick was. Maybe NOT falling asleep on the couch first?\nP.S. This is the penultimate episode.

This Lockdown gave us so much time to do different things. Having no contact with outside world had confined us to 2 things : \n.\n\n1. Household chores\n2. Source of Entertainment\n.\n\nHousehold Chores like Cooking Food, Washing Clothes & Utensils, Cleaning &  Dusting entire House and even Sanitizing everything had become daily Compulsion for me without availability of Domestic Help. Initially I thought it would be like hell of a daily work to do, Thanks to my supporting Hubby, for me it has been a cake walk.\n.\n\nSince lot of time was saved by sharing household chores I looked for Source of Entertainment  during free time. Starting with Surfing Instagram, then Watching the never ending Netflix content,  Creating funny TikTok Videos, Playing LUDO with Family, and lastly connect with Friends & Relatives over Zoom. A part time fun becomes a full time Addiction.\n.\n\nThough these Addictions & Compulsions mellow down in a last phase of Lockdown, they have left a beautiful bunch of ever lasting memories.\n.\n\nHow about you guys....\n.\n\nDid you also started feeling any Compulsion or Addiction during Lockdown days. \n.\nPlease share ....👇👇\n\n.\n#lockdowndiaries#addictionisreal#compulsion#householdchores#cookinglife#washing#cleaningaddict#sanitizing#editingphotos#instagramaddiction#ludoking#netflixseries#zoommeeting#lockdownmemories#indianmommyblogger#indianinfluencer#bloggermommy#indianmom#workingmomlife#weekendiscomingjul10#instausneed#instreeel#oursecondyearbegin#girrbjkmwil#positivityneededmuch#mummaisamazed","NumberOfLikes":845,"Hashtags":["#lockdowndiarie","#addictionisrea","#compulsio","#householdchore","#cookinglif","#washin","#cleaningaddic","#sanitizin","#editingphoto","#instagramaddictio","#ludokin","#netflixserie","#zoommeetin","#lockdownmemorie","#indianmommyblogge","#indianinfluence","#bloggermomm","#indianmo","#workingmomlif","#weekendiscomingjul1","#instausnee","#instreee","#oursecondyearbegi","#girrbjkmwi","#positivityneededmuc","#mummaisamazed"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Dr. Roli Gupta on July 09, 2020.

Hoping to include and inspire the kids along. Got any ideas? Share them in a comment 🙂\n\nLOCKDOWN 2.0 - DAY 1\nFor today I'll just share some creations by my son who's 8 in the next few posts. He's super impressionable through television and what he sees through gaming, movies and other visual content. Much like a LOT of other kids his age. So we try and limit his time in front of the 'idiot box' as it was called earlier. But we have to accept the potential of this media generation and guide them to learn from it. And I am taking the pointer from my son to be honest. If he watches something and then we get him to switch it off. He stays in that zone mentally but then uses his creative thinking to enact or create his own versions of what he may have seen. This could be armour and swords and helmets out of cardboard, sketches and drawings or 3D craft models. \nStay tuned for my learning the art of innovative creation from my 8 year old son!\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#ART #CREATIVITY #FAMILYFUN #LOCKDOWN #INSPIRATION #LEARN #funlearning #kraftymommy #thekraftymommy #kraftykids #kidscrafts #isolationcreation #myfeelgoodfactor #lockdowndiaries #innovative #creativethinking #playlearning","NumberOfLikes":6,"Hashtags":["#ART","#CREATIVITY","#FAMILYFUN","#LOCKDOWN","#INSPIRATION","#LEARN","#funlearning","#kraftymommy","#thekraftymommy","#kraftykids","#kidscrafts","#isolationcreation","#myfeelgoodfactor","#lockdowndiaries","#innovative","#creativethinking","#playlearning"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The Krafty Mommy on July 09, 2020.

My mom worked as a government officer for almost 25 years of her life and I always admired her achievements and the way people used to respect her. She was a workaholic and still managed to look after me. I scored well in my boards and JEE and could join any private college easily. My family was looking forward to me becoming a good engineer but I couldn\u2019t see myself as one. So, I dropped that idea and decided to go for journalism. I planned to attend UPSC classes along with it but once I started studying journalism, everything changed! In the 1st year, campus selections for a radio jockey were held. I knew how talkative I was and how much I loved listening to the radio and host shows in front of the mirror. I had a secret passion. So, I gave it a try.\nI cleared the 1st round but got rejected in the 2nd. I got to know of a vacancy next year and applied, but the same thing happened. I faced humiliation which I\u2019ll never forget. A few months later, I got a call from another radio station asking if I was interested in a post. I was so excited, I agreed immediately! I went for the interview, cleared 3 rounds but got rejected in the 4th. The funny thing is that nobody got selected and I got called 2 weeks later and was offered an internship. I worked very hard, went to crowded places to get bytes. My mentor RJ really helped me through this chaos. I thought they would give me a job after the internship but I was wrong. \nAnother brand was coming to Aurangabad and my college told me to give an interview. But the first thought that popped in my mind was that it was worthless, I\u2019ll end up getting rejected again. My then colleague, now husband told me to give it a try, and convinced me after a motivating pep talk. Surprisingly, I did well and got the job. Two and a half years after working for that company, I switched and now work for another big radio brand. It was not an easy journey, people told me I wasn\u2019t girly enough and my voice isn\u2019t soft. But when I look back, I feel like I was meant to face rejection and destined to go through the struggle.

As per the directions of use, each bite should be chewed 13 times with lips closed. In another absurd direction, person should sleep fully covered from head to toe to sweat properly. Sriram also claimed that person with no symptoms can also consume it as an immunity booster. The further advertisement told that they are ready to share the \u201CHerbal Mysurpa\u201D formula with central government so that they can produce it in large quantities.\nRegarding the raid, K Tamil Selvan Designated Officer of the Food Safety Department told Times Now that they have launched an enquiry against the shop owner who when questioned was unable to even name the full list of ingredients used in the Mysurpa.\nThe Food Safety Department on Wednesday made an inspection and cancelled the license for the shop. The officials also seized approximately 150 kilograms of herbal Mysurpa which was being sold for Rs 800 per kilo and a case has been filed against the shop owner under section 53 and 61 of Food Safety and Standards Act 2006. The samples of the Mysurpa have been collected to analyze the ingredients that were put in it.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n#lockdown2020 #lockdownlife #lockdowncooking #lockdowndiaries #lockdownmemes #coronavirus #corona #coronavirusmemes #coronavirusmemes😂😂😂 #coronatime #coronavaccine #coronavirusvaccine #vaccine #newsleakcentre #nlc #likes4like #likes4like #followforfollowback #covid19 #tamilnadu #delhi #herbalmysurpa #sweets","NumberOfLikes":16,"Hashtags":["#lockdown2020","#lockdownlife","#lockdowncooking","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdownmemes","#coronavirus","#corona","#coronavirusmemes","#coronavirusmemes😂😂😂","#coronatime","#coronavaccine","#coronavirusvaccine","#vaccine","#newsleakcentre","#nlc","#likes4like","#likes4like","#followforfollowback","#covid19","#tamilnadu","#delhi","#herbalmysurpa","#sweets"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by News Leak Centre on July 09, 2020.

There was the time we baked 24\/7 and shed a tear of joy when we found flour in stock in Sainsbury\u2019s. The weeks we eagerly awaited episodes of the Imagineering Story to hit Disney+, and in the meantime took up random crafting projects like Macrame or filled our days with jigsaws. I\u2019ve lost friends, made friends and grew closer to those that mattered. I\u2019ve had days to celebrate on my body acceptance journey and days where I\u2019ve felt defeated. I fell in and out of love with running and threw myself into a new job that I\u2019m loving. 4 months. It\u2019s been almost 4 months since I had to self isolate after showing symptoms of the virus. 4 months navigating the new normal. 4 months with the fear of loosing someone close to Covid but also 4 months feeling lucky that I haven\u2019t. I feel blessed to have this platform to not only share my thoughts and feelings or to distract myself by snapping photos, but for the connections. The chats in DMs with those navigating the rollercoaster of lockdown. The appreciation of the small things, sharing our favourite snacks or influencing each other to buy the trainers or dress or whatever in that moment makes us happy.

We should not wait for World Mental Health Day or perfect hashtag to arrive to talk about it. There is no excuse to continue to remain in the closet. I found this quaint note written by my friend and kind mentor @amritahaldipur and felt the strong desire to write about #mentalhealth. Because her heart-written message is so relevant today and for the comming tomorrows. I believe as we gear up slowly and steadly to face the life post lockdown it is crucial that we catch the right pace, ease and flow of mind. Lets not do the same things in the old fashioned conventional ways. Especially, the creatives out there - Writers, Artists, Actors, Painters, Musicians and even Graphic Designers its important to be vulnerable to our flaws and face them each day with smile and without losing the sense of action. Treat every mistake or setback as a learning curve and stay put, the end of the tunnel is comming soon. Soon, there can come a day when you realise that actually there never was a tunnel but only light and darkness was nothing but a mere illusion or a dream. Recently, I read one trick to deal with this illusion of worrisome doubt. Whenever you feel the nagative self talk running endlessly inside your brain, ask that doubt why should you believe it? It can give you an amswer but keep on counter questioning it until you can see through the seriousness that your mind has been faking for so long and you come up with an alternative perception that drives you toward a nurturing and nourishing action. The goal is to Doubt The Doubt and distract yourself from the negative train of thoughts. Whats your trick for dealing with negative self talk, worry, fear, insecurities, depression etc ?

Quarantine radically changed our lifestyles but it also brought with it some new rituals. \n\nSo here are few tips to keep those new habits in your post lockdown life:\n\n▪️ Take note of what has worked and what hasn't \n\n▪️ Make it easy 👉 now that you are aware of what has worked - and hasn't - you should set up your environment in a way that reinforces your new habits \ni.g. going for a run before breakfast? Prepare your active wear the night before.\n\n▪️Make space for your new activities into your routine 👉 i.g set calendar invitations to yourself so you know you have allotted time in your schedule for your new ritual\n\n▪️Nurture the communities you've built 👉 that will help you to maintain your habit and to hold you accountable\n\n▪️Allow yourself to adapt, and be realistic 👉 the reopening will challenge your newly formed habits so you will need to be adaptable in order to maintain it. It's important to set a new goal for your  post-lockdown activity, it will help you to find new energy.\n\nWaiting to resume our normal lives stay safe ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ \n\n😎\n😎\n😎\n\n#motivationdaily\n#motivationalquotes\n#dailyhabits #healthyhabits #rituals #yogaathome #lockdowncooking #lockdowndiaries #lockdownlife #postlockdown #positivethought #positivewords #positivevibes #habitsofhealth #workoutinspo #workoutmotivation #motivationquotes #quarantinediaries #cookingwithlove #cookingtips #skincareritual #advicequotes #lifeadvice","NumberOfLikes":18,"Hashtags":["#motivationdaily","#motivationalquotes","#dailyhabits","#healthyhabits","#rituals","#yogaathome","#lockdowncooking","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdownlife","#postlockdown","#positivethought","#positivewords","#positivevibes","#habitsofhealth","#workoutinspo","#workoutmotivation","#motivationquotes","#quarantinediaries","#cookingwithlove","#cookingtips","#skincareritual","#advicequotes","#lifeadvice"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Bean - Vibe \/\/ Ethical Style on July 08, 2020 tagging @bean_vibe.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1594224292,"LocalDate":"Wed Jul 08 18:04:52 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"supereraya","CaptionText":"The COLD never bothered me anyway🤣 Chos!

Once I was furloughed I threw myself into this project. It had always been the last place in the house to decorate, but as it happened, it spurred on a full redecoration of the rest of the house🤦\u200D♀️. I had started to do macrame last year and found it really relaxing so I created this large wall hanging. I didn\u2019t want to wallpaper the long wall up the stairs, as it would enclose the space, so I did the end wall and the wall above it on the landing which gives much more impact when you walk in the front door. The orange door is my old front door. I had two front doors which was a little pointless, so I added some hooks and a mirror and made a feature of it on the wall. Lockdown art work by me. The gallery wall is still evolving, I\u2019m just waiting for the right pieces to come along. The floor is original and took some almighty scrubbing and elbow grease!

It has always been my escape and my outlet. @sarah_rowe83 has always been my running partner but #covid19 took that away from me. Running suddenly gave me too much headspace at the beginning of #lockdown anxiety creeped in, tears would flow and breathing would be strained. I suggested Sarah and I do one of our runs over the phone. It wasn\u2019t long before @_jenn_d_t & @kazziemeik joined us every Sunday morning. As we each separately churned out miles at our own pace we spent sometimes up to 2 hours, chatting it out, hashing it out, getting the stress out all over the phone. These girls know the small details of my day, the highs, lows, unreasonable child moments. The my husband is driving me crazy moments, the will this ever end moments. They are not the only people in my world that I consider to be there for me but these weekly calls with my girls are what got me through lockdown. The headspace, the body space, the me time but not alone time. Last night and because we now can, we turned those calls a reality and walked for hours together and child free. Not even sure we\u2019ve ever been together childfree 😂 but it was awesome. And as this all eases (not ends) and our calls are not as long or guaranteed to have all 4 of us on them I\u2019ll stay forever grateful for you girls helping get me through this bat-sh*t crazy time!! .\n.\n.\n#friendslikethese #friends #lockdowndiaries #twilighthike #coronadiaries","NumberOfLikes":37,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#lockdown","#friendslikethese","#friends","#lockdowndiaries","#twilighthike","#coronadiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Dawn Caulfield in Pentland Hills Regional Park with @sarah_rowe83, @kazziemeik, and @_jenn_d_t.

Some memories build our core and define who we are. The Past will always hold good memories as well as something that we don't want to revisit. There will be monsters too, waiting for your attention and wanting to be unleashed. But what's the worth of treasuring all those memories if we don't revisit them? I always loved the concept of a Patronus spell. (needless to say, I'm a huge \"Harry Potter\" fan) It's about magnifying a strong happy memory that protects us from the worst. It does make sense anyways, we all should remind ourselves what is precious to us every once in a while.
