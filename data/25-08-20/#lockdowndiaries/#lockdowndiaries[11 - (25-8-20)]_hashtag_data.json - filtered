So, here I present my kinda biryani.\nI like putting oodles of saffron flakes and also a tinge of yellow and orange food colouring into my biryani.

The RCC then directed him to the nearest government facility for chemotherapy. \n.\n.\n.\nHis first visit to the facility was on 30 March, a day after Melapalayam was shut down. According to son Muhammad Ibrahim, they weren't allowed inside after half a day's wait in the scorching heat. They re-attempted on 22 April when Muhammad\u2019s condition further deteriorated, still in vain. Swipe left for the receipts. \n.\n.\n.\nA video of Peer Muhammad shot on the same day shows him in an extremely precarious condition. Five days later, he died.\n.\n.\n.\nFrom an entire area being cordoned off as part of 'COVID 19 protocol', to pregnant women and grievously sick patients in the locality being denied treatment, the healthcare prejudice and stigma are both real and dangerous. Melapalayam was branded as a 'corona hub', in spite of just 32 cases in an area with 3 lakh people. The same is also in direct contradiction to the World Health Organisation's order to desist from further alienating victims of the virus.\n.\n.\n.\nThe area was completely shut down on the orders of the District Collector Shilpa Prakash Satish. The DC also ordered a stop to all vehicular movement and barricaded the locality completely. The seemingly misplaced management resulted in severe distress for those in need of medical attention. \n.\n.\n.\nArabi Gnaniyar, an ambulance driver (swipe left for photo) who saw patients from Melapayalam struggling with accessing medical care, said, \u201CEverybody thinks Melapalayam is where coronavirus is spreading from.

Without lows, there are no highs. Such is life. You cannot truly appreciate the good, without enduring the bad.

I\u2019ve also felt down and hopeless with all that\u2019s going on in the world and had days where all I wanted to do was lie on the sofa, binge Netflix, and indulge in comfort foods. I just started coming out of that a few weeks ago as the beaches began to reopen here and I feel lucky that this ankle thing happened now and not then, because I\u2019m just so much more equipped to deal with it. Now, time not spent surfing and skating seems to have me pivoting harder towards reading, playing around with my photos, and tinkering around more in the kitchen.
