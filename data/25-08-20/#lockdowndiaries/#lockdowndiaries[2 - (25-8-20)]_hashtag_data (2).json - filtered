This is almost a daily routine where he demands to cuddle my tummy when he falls asleep. \n\n🧸The way he tells off @ricksterzzz when he troubles me. He very stubbornly believes that he is the only person who gets to tickle or trouble his Mamma 😆\n\n🧸The way he seeks for my reassurance when somebody promises something. I have always strived to give him the truth. I find that it develops a very strong trust bond.\n\n🧸The way that he loves Bollywood songs and will definitely whip out those thumkas just like his mamma does 😅😆\n\n🧸The way that he is so good at sulking, just like his Mamma😄. Not proud, but it is what it is.\n\n🧸The way he reminds me of empathy by pointing out that I maybe doing the same things that I termed wrong.\n\nDo share some of the precious moments that you have shared with your little one? These are trying times, let's fall back on those memories that bring joy.\n\n#grizzlyezra #grizzlybear #growingtoofast #littlenothings #lifewiththebear #boymom #boymomlife #mommyhoodunplugged #momsofinstagram #momlife #mommicroblogger #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":252,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":18,"Timestamp":1597782054,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 18 22:20:54 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Optical illusion but make it fashion!\n\nNothing like some strategically placed pleats to hide 5 courses.

Then horror which we used to read in past came in reality for this generation... Pandemic. \nLockdown was imposed in short interval notice and in a snap sound of fingers, many found themselves jobless, trapped inside. Privileged as me just had to get ourselves keep confined to our spaces. Real struggle was for them whose life started daily with sunrise and bread earned by long day hard work. Now there was no work.\nAs a photographers' perspective, shoots got cancelled, project delayed or denied. After a few days of not shooting, we started searching way to pursue passion. Business meetings started on conference video calls. Few photographers came with a temporary solution of shooting on video calls. Facetime shoots, WhatsApp Call shoots, Google video shoots, Skype shoot came in existence... in a shell, Virtual Shoots. Ofcourse not good as actual shoot, but \"...dil ko khush rakhne ko ghalib ye khayal achchha hai...\", it became a trend amongst photographers.\nAfter initial denial, me too thought to give it a try. Talked to few people connected with me. Now I am sharing few results. \nI won't call myself as Photographer for these shots, just a director. \n--- \u2022\u2022\u2022 ---\nIn picture: @itsharshitaagarwal\n--- \u2022\u2022\u2022 ---\n#virtual #shoot #virtualshoot #facetime #facetimephotoshoot #whatsapp #videocall #portrait_vision #pictureoftheday #photooftheday #pursuitofportraits #portrait_today #portrait_mood #portraitphotography #portrait_shots #portraiture #mood #moodygrams #snapseed #lockdowndiaries #lockdown #coronatime #portraitvision_ #pr0ject_uno #pr0ject_soul #portraitphotographer #bluedenim #relaxing #denim #relax","NumberOfLikes":37,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597763368,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 18 17:09:28 CEST 2020","Location":"India"},{"CaptionText":"Still Alive ! 😂\n\nFollow us for more memes - @chillhousememes7\nFB PAGE - MEMES JOKES & SARCASM\/TROLLS\n\n#lockdownsa #lockdownmemes #lockdownart #lockdownbirthday #lockdownlife #lockdowndays #lockdownfood #lockdown #lockdowncooking #lockdownbaking #lockdown2020 #bbnaijalockdown #lockdownhair #lockdownmemes2020  #lockdowndiaries #lockdownmeme #lockdownindia\n#lockdownphotography #lockdownfun #lockdownbaby #lockdownproject #lockdownuk #lockdownextended #lockdownworkout #lockdownchallenge #lockdown2020😷 #lockdownsessions #lockdownsouthafrica #lockdownrecipes","NumberOfLikes":10,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Memes | Jokes & Sarcasm\/Trolls on August 18, 2020.

These greens are not fancy yet they make good side dishes that pairs with any savory meal, ideal fillings for toasted bread or simply for wholesome noshing. \n\nIt suggests a Middle Eastern influence, with tahini sauce drizzled generously over the greens, deepening its flavours. If left to me, I\u2019d easily douse the whole lot with this rousing sauce.

Que podrías lograr si te anclaces devotamente en Amor propio lo que queda de este año? \u2063\n\u2063\nPd: creo firmemente esto porque es lo que veo con mis clientas VIP que han logrado este año a pesar de todos los obstáculos, crear la vida más deliciosa que podrían imaginar al crear este sutil cambio interno...❤️cuéntame en los comentarios tu opinión!","NumberOfLikes":544,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":27,"Timestamp":1597758646,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 18 15:50:46 CEST 2020","Location":"Bali, Indonesia.

I want to remind myself of all the hurdles I\u2019ve overcome and the wins (both small & large) that I\u2019ve had during this time. As someone with chronic ill health, my battles are daily, and yet I will always jump (or crawl if needs be) to an opportunity to uplift myself, and in turn, others. My #wearyourhappy mantra was borne of a necessity to create, to reflect and to stubbornly hold onto who I was despite such gruelling and life altering illness and treatment regime. And whilst I am not cured, I am truly at peace within myself and hope that even the smallest of smiles appears on your face seeing me embrace life with a little fun & colour, in direct defiance of the troubles both near and far. Today I wore purple eyeshadow and embraced my wild hair & colourful ensemble to face the world. It helped. A lot. I\u2019ve learned it\u2019s perfectly ok to voice what you need to not only survive, but to thrive. And it\u2019s not just ok, it\u2019s a necessity to honour yourself first and fore most. Not only will it become a life long habit, it will also teach others how you need to be treated. We all want to be seen & accepted. And if you don\u2019t- it\u2019s because you\u2019re yet to accept yourself. That\u2019s at the heart of it. Pure, indulgent, life-giving self love.

Forts were built to guard and protect these routes. Asawa is one of these forts which was built in ancient times on the roads connecting Dahanu and Tarapur ports to the country. The ramparts of the fort are constructed by stones stacked on top of each other. The cannon found on the fort is mounted on a wooden cart. There are 2 tanks dug in the rock near the cannon. There is a huge embankment at the southern end of the fort. The west wall of the tank has steps leading down to the tank. Walking north, on the left hand side, you can see the site of the ruined entrance facing west. On the left is a step to descend. This route has a steep slope. After crossing it and descending, two parts split. The path on the left leads to the broken idol of Maruti. The path on the right leads to the 3 caves.\n\n@girlonthemountains @shodhashodh and Me 😉","NumberOfLikes":75,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1597684037,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 19:07:17 CEST 2020","Location":"Asava fort"},{"CaptionText":"Why so serious???\n#bottleartwork #bottledecor #bottlecrafts #bottleart  #homedecor #handmade #decor #thekuppi #artistsoninstagram#bottleideas #emptybottles #lockdowndiaries#artncraft #mobilephotography #keralacrafts#bottlelove #myactivity#keralatalents #trivandrum #handmadewithlove #keraladiaries#diyhomedecor#diy#galifician#galificarts #galificartist#instagram #bottleartlovers#whysoserious#joker","NumberOfLikes":35,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Paint n' Pallette in Trivandrum, India.

But, for the last seven years, since she was house-bound,  we would go to her place every Navroze for lunch (she preferred to keep her dinners light) with Parsi Bhonu catered to, from various Parsi Caterers. The table would have this spread of Marghi na Farcha or Salli Marghi, Patra ni Macchi, Mutton Pulao-Daar, Rotlis, Lagan nu Achaar and for dessert, Lagan nu Custard. And before that, some Kawab \/ Cutless with the beer. And there would always be so much leftover, and we would have it for days after, and would end up skipping dinner that evening. \nThis year, since we didn\u2019t have to rush to her place with food, we decided to cook at home, as a small tribute to my mom, and, decided not to go overboard. So, for Navroze lunch there was an absolutely divine Bharuchi Kid Ghosh with a fragrant Kaju Kismis Pulao. The missus had nailed the flavours. 💯😋The mother would have approved for sure 😊.\nFor dessert it was roses, roses all the way... made Gulab Cup Cakes for the first time. With a genuine Gulcand centre and a Rose Water-Gulcand buttercream frosting. We loved it.

Now restrictions have been lifted, the pre-recorded weekly Zoom interviews are designed to provide insight into how our community of survivors are managing in the pandemic as a whole. A clip of each already posted to the DS channels is also posted to our feed to briefly introduce our wonderful Instagram audience and to give everyone a taster of personal affiliation with each survivor!\n\nLockdown interview number thirteen features stroke survivors Sheelagh and Niki. Sheelagh is our Administrator at Different Strokes. She had her stroke in 2018 at the age of 51. Niki had her stroke in October 2016 aged 52. She tells us about her atypical symptoms, her time in hospital and the home support, stimulation & exercise she received for the 6 weeks after. Niki talks about her anxieties, mental health problems and emotions, and tackles the taboo of how post stroke care focuses more on the physical and not enough psychological. She stresses the importance of seeking help and support and how it\u2019s essential to getting back on our feet. She also chats about family history, genetics and diabetes and how she combats these through diet and stress management. Niki talks about coming to terms with and working through accepting and acknowledging the new her. They both discuss the \u2018brick wall\u2019 caused by fatigue, how frustrating it can be and learning points on how to manage it.\n\nNiki has worked from home but like many of us has struggled with isolation. Unknowingly Niki contracted Covid-19 in March and only recently realised what felt like the flu was, in fact, the virus. She highlights the further barriers and complications for disabled people, including her Mum who has many at risk health conditions and is in a care home that has had outbreaks.\n\n Catch the full interview at:\n🔗 https:\/\/differentstrokes.co.uk\/stroke-survivor-experiences-during-lockdown\/\n▶️ https:\/\/youtu.be\/nNBMW414umk\n👍🏼 https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/differentstrokescharity\/","NumberOfLikes":13,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1597658744,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 12:05:44 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":76,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by piku on August 17, 2020.

Of Mom's chicken curry, which is mainly cooked using the most rudimentary spices. Due to the given circumstances, it has become difficult to get hold of the different spices and herbs, that you would require, to come up with a fancy dish. And thus, we used lemon leaves here, for garnishing, which not only adds a bit of colour to the dish, but also enhances its aroma. So here's a picture of local chicken, cooked in a simple gravy, using onions, garlic, ginger, tomatoes, and lastly, a blend of various spices(cardamom, cinnamon, dried red chilli, bay leaves). \n\n#chicken#chickensofinstagram #chickencurry #chickenlover #kitchenchronicles #cleaneating #chefmodeon #lockdown2020 #lockdowndiaries #chickenrecipes #buzzfeedfood #dailyfoodfeed #instayum #instagood #instaeats #foodbloggers #foodstagram #foodventures #foodiesofinstagram #foodgasm #foodaddict #foodphotography #foodforthought #foodtherapy #nomnomnom #happytummy #goodeats","NumberOfLikes":51,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @__thecarbdashians__ on August 17, 2020.

If you were, you wouldn\u2019t have anything to strive for. You have this one life to pursue your dreams. If you get the urge to create something with your life, do it! \n\nSometimes the tougher the circumstances are in our life, the more of a catalyst those circumstances will become in pushing us to fight for our dream.\n\nWhen you find that burning desire to be or do something, you\u2019ve found a powerful force that can cut through seemingly impossible circumstances and limitations.\n\nFor me passion is purpose. It\u2019s that desire to be someone or to do something. It moves you like nothing else in life. It\u2019s something you\u2019re attracted to, something you\u2019re passionate about and it fills you with joy and sets your heart on fire when you do it.\n\nTravelling fills me with joy and ignites my passion for living to the fullest on this planet. When I am not travelling I am always researching, browsing and planning to travel. It\u2019s always on my mind and in my spirit. \n\nIstanbul is one city I have visited a couple of times and yet there is so much left to see and explore. Love the mix of classic royal ottoman culture, modern day Europeanised influences, Islamic art, the delicious Turkish cuisine and the grand charming palaces on the steps of Bosphorus river. I simply cannot wait to travel to Turkey 🇹🇷 again. \n\nOnce the world finally gets a handle on this deadly pandemic I will forever be grateful for a chance to travel again in peace. \n\n#travel #travelgram #instatravel #tourism #passportready #wanderlust #besties #forever #ilovetravel #passionpassport #suitcasetravels #traveldeeper #iamatraveller #discoveries #forbestravelguide #passion #travelislife #travelispassion #ciragan #palace #kempinski #istanbul #turkey #ottoman #empire #lockdowndiaries #postlockdowngoals #travelgoals #memories #travelmemories","NumberOfLikes":47,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by wanderlustbestiesforever🦋 in Ciragan Palace Kempinski Istanbul.

Now grease the baking tin with butter or refined oil. Before pouring the batter into tin, add ENO to the mix and gently mix it using cut and fold method. Make sure to not over whisk the batter post adding ENO. And now immediately pour the batter in tin.\nPut the tin in microwave and set the timer for 5 mins. Take out the tin and your nice fluffy sponge is ready. Keep the sponge to cool down.\n\nP.S. I decorated the cake since it was a friend's birthday. You can have the simply baked cake sponge with coffee or tea. It will taste awesome! \nFor layering and decoration: \nBefore layering the sponges, I have sprayed them with sugar syrup to make it little moist. While layering, I used the chocolate syrup. It helps the sponge to stick together and gives a good flavour as well. For decoration, I have randomly arrange Oreo original biscuits and chocolate pieces over condensed milk which I poured on the top most sponge. On the sides I have arranged choco waffle rolls. To make the rolls stick to the sponge, you can use the choclate syrup or Hershey's cocoa spread.\n\nNote: \n1) For a 3 tier cake like mine, I baked 3 cake sponges. \n2) No oven pre heating required.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#oreocake #lockdowndiaries #birthdaycake #homebaked #homemade #bakinglove #cakelove #cake #cakedecorating #cakesofinstagram #ig_india #igcakes #chocolatecake #hersheys #dukes #waffles #cocoa #cadburyoreo #cadbury #cakelovers #homechef #3layercake #layeredcake #yummy #microwavecake #quickcake #easycakes #cakerecipe #cakebaking #foodphotography","NumberOfLikes":13,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Shruti Kishore on August 16, 2020.

Maa Bramhamoyee Temple.\nThe temple is almost 250 years old, although the newly refurbished temple was constructed in 2010. Sadhak Mouni Baba was famously associated with this temple. The temple complex has a Panchamundi asan, a Dhunaghar and a Rath is also present which is taken out during rathyatra. The Saraswati river flows behind the temple. Although it has dried up, during this monsoon it was full to the brinks. The temple is very popular and sacred to the local mass. Located in lush green surroundings, it is a great place to visit.\n\n#nikon #natgeoyourshot #natgeo #cycling #cyclinglife #roadtrip #wanderlust #explore #_bclicks_ #kolkatasutra #kolkata #westbengal #rural #countryside #temple #weekend #kolkataevocative #lonelyplanet #sunset #devotional #ig_calcutta #lockdowndiaries #peace #beautifulbengal #kolkatawapin #indianmonuments #travelgram #natgeotravellerindia #india","NumberOfLikes":61,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597559474,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 16 08:31:14 CEST 2020","Location":"Nanda"},{"CaptionText":"I was today years old when I learned that there is a Sims app for iOS and also I am living in this fuzzy jumper. #lockdowndiaries #whatis2020 #bellyscratching #slowlylosingit","NumberOfLikes":68,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Vivien Marie 🇩🇪🇦🇺 in Merri Creek.
