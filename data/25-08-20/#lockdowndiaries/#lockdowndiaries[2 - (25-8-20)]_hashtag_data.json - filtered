Then horror which we used to read in past came in reality for this generation... Pandemic. \nLockdown was imposed in short interval notice and in a snap sound of fingers, many found themselves jobless, trapped inside. Privileged as me just had to get ourselves keep confined to our spaces. Real struggle was for them whose life started daily with sunrise and bread earned by long day hard work. Now there was no work.\nAs a photographers' perspective, shoots got cancelled, project delayed or denied. After a few days of not shooting, we started searching way to pursue passion. Business meetings started on conference video calls. Few photographers came with a temporary solution of shooting on video calls. Facetime shoots, WhatsApp Call shoots, Google video shoots, Skype shoot came in existence... in a shell, Virtual Shoots. Ofcourse not good as actual shoot, but \"...dil ko khush rakhne ko ghalib ye khayal achchha hai...\", it became a trend amongst photographers.\nAfter initial denial, me too thought to give it a try. Talked to few people connected with me. Now I am sharing few results. \nI won't call myself as Photographer for these shots, just a director. \n--- \u2022\u2022\u2022 ---\nIn picture: @itsharshitaagarwal\n--- \u2022\u2022\u2022 ---\n#virtual #shoot #virtualshoot #facetime #facetimephotoshoot #whatsapp #videocall #portrait_vision #pictureoftheday #photooftheday #pursuitofportraits #portrait_today #portrait_mood #portraitphotography #portrait_shots #portraiture #mood #moodygrams #snapseed #lockdowndiaries #lockdown #coronatime #portraitvision_ #pr0ject_uno #pr0ject_soul #portraitphotographer #bluedenim #relaxing #denim #relax","NumberOfLikes":37,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597763368,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 18 17:09:28 CEST 2020","Location":"India"},{"CaptionText":"Still Alive ! 😂\n\nFollow us for more memes - @chillhousememes7\nFB PAGE - MEMES JOKES & SARCASM\/TROLLS\n\n#lockdownsa #lockdownmemes #lockdownart #lockdownbirthday #lockdownlife #lockdowndays #lockdownfood #lockdown #lockdowncooking #lockdownbaking #lockdown2020 #bbnaijalockdown #lockdownhair #lockdownmemes2020  #lockdowndiaries #lockdownmeme #lockdownindia\n#lockdownphotography #lockdownfun #lockdownbaby #lockdownproject #lockdownuk #lockdownextended #lockdownworkout #lockdownchallenge #lockdown2020😷 #lockdownsessions #lockdownsouthafrica #lockdownrecipes","NumberOfLikes":10,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Memes | Jokes & Sarcasm\/Trolls on August 18, 2020.

Actually a 12 :) (As I do my best Carole King Tapestry pose)\n\nI\u2019ve learnt something pretty big about myself during lockdown and I don\u2019t know if you guys can relate. I\u2019ve learnt that I need to set boundaries and say no more often. As a self-proclaimed recluse I love time alone to be in my own zone or with people who inspire me and stir my soul, working on projects towards exciting goals. But so often, my people-pleasing side takes over and I end up extending far too much energy on draining obligations and doing things I don\u2019t want to do. It\u2019s like life was just \u2018getting through\u2019 one thing or another before I could get some peace! When lockdown started, the idea of having a clear calendar for a little while actually filled me with me such a sense of relief that it really threw me back. Did society really take that great a toll on my well-being? Am I that fragile or anti-social a person? But it was great because I was able to communicate with the people in my life I really wanted to communicate with and work on things I wanted to work on without huge amounts of distraction (except for a tiny child). The thought of re-entering society after this lovely house bound sojourn actually filled me with dread. And I do know that many people still had to carry on as usual or really suffered or had to step up to the plate and be super heroes during this time so I don\u2019t want to make light of the situation. But I think we\u2019ve all learnt a little bit about ourselves. Now that lockdown measures are being lifted, I am going to start either finding a way to see the joy in everything I do (even if I don\u2019t want to do it!) or getting the guts to say no to things I don\u2019t want. That way, hopefully, the things I do want can find their way into my life and I can live in the most authentic way possible. #stoicmindset #zenhabits #peoplepleaser #peoplepleasing #lockdowndiaries #lockdownthoughts","NumberOfLikes":27,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Pia Varma on August 18, 2020.

Forts were built to guard and protect these routes. Asawa is one of these forts which was built in ancient times on the roads connecting Dahanu and Tarapur ports to the country. The ramparts of the fort are constructed by stones stacked on top of each other. The cannon found on the fort is mounted on a wooden cart. There are 2 tanks dug in the rock near the cannon. There is a huge embankment at the southern end of the fort. The west wall of the tank has steps leading down to the tank. Walking north, on the left hand side, you can see the site of the ruined entrance facing west. On the left is a step to descend. This route has a steep slope. After crossing it and descending, two parts split. The path on the left leads to the broken idol of Maruti. The path on the right leads to the 3 caves.\n\n@girlonthemountains @shodhashodh and Me 😉","NumberOfLikes":75,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1597684037,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 19:07:17 CEST 2020","Location":"Asava fort"},{"CaptionText":"Why so serious???\n#bottleartwork #bottledecor #bottlecrafts #bottleart  #homedecor #handmade #decor #thekuppi #artistsoninstagram#bottleideas #emptybottles #lockdowndiaries#artncraft #mobilephotography #keralacrafts#bottlelove #myactivity#keralatalents #trivandrum #handmadewithlove #keraladiaries#diyhomedecor#diy#galifician#galificarts #galificartist#instagram #bottleartlovers#whysoserious#joker","NumberOfLikes":34,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Paint n' Pallette in Trivandrum, India.

I tend to fall really hard for them. I have nothing short of a romantic fling with London. 12 years on, I am still smitten. It keeps me shelling out eye watering rent, exploring cafes with the giddy excitement of a teenager on a first date and weeping when @dominiqueansellondon decides to close its pretty doors. \n\u2063\nI have moved a fair number of times within the UK. 3 years in Glasgow, 4 years in London, 3.5 years in Southampton and now nearly 1 year back in the capital. My love for London remains intact.\n\u2063\nWhy do I love London so much? For starters, the 2000-year-old history charms my socks off. Its endured quite a lot in that time. The influenza pandemic. The Blitz. Financial meltdowns, as recent as 2008. And now the novel coronavirus.\n\u2063\nBritain officially entered recession last week and things are unravelling quickly. Jobs are being lost as furlough scheme is winding down. Every time I go doomscrolling, another business shuts down. While landlords and homeowners have been cut some financial slack, renters like me have been left to fend for themselves. I genuinely fear for our jobs. I feel like I am sitting on top of a precarious precipice that I can tumble off any second. But, in what some may call my foolish ways, this lack of stability has added fuel to my \u2018live for today\u2019 attitude. I am even more adamant to make the most of here and now. I feel like I took everything in life for granted, even the luxury of dealing with setbacks or curve balls without a pandemic suspended in the background. Clearly things can always get worse so I might as well enjoy when I can.\n\u2063\nThere are SO MANY UNCERTAINTIES floating in the horizon that I cannot even begin to address them. I have huge dips in my mood and genuine childish inner tantrums wondering KENO COVID HOILO. Working out, reading more, and brunching with my boys after 4 months really, really helps. \n\u2063\nI feel extremely privileged to be able to go out and do normal things because I know many people are not able to do so. I am always mindful of that. But I also allow myself to give in to feeling good without thinking much else. At this point in time, it\u2019s become a survival tool.","NumberOfLikes":507,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Samira Ahmed in London, United Kingdom.

I come from a big, close family - and being away from them was really difficult. \n\nI remember one time, I was walking through a shopping centre outside London, and suddenly I felt a wave of uncontrollable emotion rush over me. I stood in the middle of the walkway, and cried. It was unexpected (and let\u2019s face it, a little awkward), but I couldn\u2019t control it. I missed home.\n\nI may be at home now, but I\u2019ve felt those waves a lot lately. Because a home isn\u2019t just about the four walls and roof over our heads. A home isn\u2019t just about the scenery we take for granted every day as we go about our lives. A home isn\u2019t just about the things that make it a place to feel secure and safe. \n\nHome, for me, is about people. The people who make my little place in the world feel content, warm and comforting. Like home. \n\nMy Mum\u2019s cooking that instantly injects me with love and my Dad\u2019s ridiculous jokes that have us rolling our eyes and laughing simultaneously. That feels like home. \nMy little brothers and sisters, our dynamic and our banter\u2026 that\u2019s home.\nSeeing my beautiful friends, and drinking bubbles, talking our heads off, practicing impossible TikTok dances, and dancing on tables as we laugh all night\u2026. that\u2019s home. \nWaking up before the sun each day, jumping in the car to the gym and moving my body with people who uplift and inspire me\u2026 that\u2019s home. \nSeeing my children play with their friends, and run through our house laughing and playing with their little buddies\u2026 that\u2019s home. \nPopping across or down the road to my neighbours\u2019 house for a quick cup of tea and a chat (or a cheeky Friday champagne)\u2026 that\u2019s home. \nSeeing my nieces and nephews, and the children of my beautiful friends grow up and play with my kids... that\u2019s home. \nWalking through our village on a Sunday when the Farmer\u2019s Market is on - buying local produce and seeing cafes so busy their customers are spilling out on the streets as they happily waiting for their coffee in the sunshine\u2026. that\u2019s home. \n\n(Continued in comments)....","NumberOfLikes":62,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":40,"Timestamp":1597658938,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 12:08:58 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Monday morning project...\n#pantry\n#CapeTown \n#lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":10,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1597658853,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 12:07:33 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Brad Ascalon Studio's approach to furniture and product design has always been about reducing an object to the essential, to only that which is necessary to benefit that object\u2019s function and its manufacturability, while assuring that the aesthetics are driven by those tenets first and foremost.

My husband @ashabbar watched a tutorial on YouTube and offered to give me one. It legit took him 2 hours as he was being super precise but the end result turned out to be AMAZING!!!!! Honestly, it was as good as a professional salon-cut and my hair looked really healthy. 😍😍😍\n.\nSince the entire process was hours long, I have somehow crammed it into a 2-minute video so that you guys can get an idea how serious he was, especially with the layers. 😁\n.\nWhat crazy thing did you do during the lockdown\/quarantine?

Here are 5 accessories that can make your ensemble look complete and effortless. #nomoreconfidential \n.\n.\n.\n1. A watch adds an elegant and classy  look to your outfit. \n2. A delicate necklace highlights your neck and pulls together your plain outfit, making it look chic. \n3. An ear cuff will add high doses of charm and grace to your look. It's a great alternative if you aren't into hoop earrings.\n4. A clutch is as practical as it is beautiful. Add a bright clutch to your neutral ensemble to make it pop. \n5. Break the monotony of an outfit with the help of a belt. Use simple belts for formal occasions and an accessorised one for a fun and bubbly look. \n.\n.\n.\nTip: when it comes to accessories, I always believe less is more. \n.\n.\n.\nFor more ideas ans suggestions do follow @wardrobe_confidentials \n.\n.\n.\n#accessoriesoftheday #neutralstyle #lessismore #chic #delecatepieces #formalorinformal #yourpick #outfitinspiration #outfitoftheday #fashion #fashionstyle #fashionblogger #fashionista #style #styleinspo #styleinspiration #styleoftheday #lockdown #lockdownlife #lockdowndiaries #loveyourself #bodypositivity #popofcolor #beyourself #wardrobestylist #wardrobe #wardeobegoals","NumberOfLikes":16,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597654586,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 10:56:26 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Focus on the little things rather than waiting for something big to come along or happen for you to be grateful for. 💫💫","NumberOfLikes":143,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Chanel Sudarski in Elwood, Victoria, Australia with @glassons, and @chanelsudarski.

It is considered as instant energy booster as it's high in carbs. \n.\n.\nRecipe ~\n1\/2 cup Soaked Sago pearls, 4 medium sized boiled and mashed potatoes, 1\/2 cup peanuts ( roasted and coarsely grinded) , Finely chopped fresh coriander leaves, Finely chopped 2 green chilly, Sendha salt to taste . \nMix all the ingredients gently with help of a spoon. Then make small balls out of it. \nTake an appe pan and put 1 Tsp ghee in each hole and put one vada ball in that hole cover and let it cook from low to medium flame for atleast 5 mins and the flip it again in same way. It takes approximately 15 mins for 1 batch to give you nice crisp golden vadas.\n( You can deep fry the vadas making them into tikkis but as I don't prefer fried things so it's a more healthier version.)\n.\n.\nI recommend you guys to try this crispy vada with healthy twist. Don't wait for vrat day just try it. It's really tasty. Crispy and crunchy from outside and yet soft from inside.\n.\n.\nYes, this is my contribution for #VratWithIFN\nI further tag @_modernkitchen , @sobhas_kitchen and @indiancookingrecipes\n.\n.\nFollow @crazy_cravingzz  for more such amazing recipes..\n.\n.\n#lockdowndiaries #vratkakhana #indianfoods #sabudanavada #sabudanarecipe #peanut #maharastrianfood #mumbai #chefsofinstagram #bloggers #eeeeeats #fasting #upvasspecial #indianbloggercommunity #foodphotographer #foodstylists #instagram #foodpost  #homecooking #foodlover #followforfollowbacks #f52gramsfoodpics #foodies #foodlovers  #maharashtra_ig","NumberOfLikes":544,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":322,"Timestamp":1597644663,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 08:11:03 CEST 2020","Location":"Berhampur, Orissa"},{"CaptionText":"#naturephotography #naturelovers #clouds \n#lockdowndiaries #loveyourself 🌍🌈","NumberOfLikes":31,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @🆂🅰🅻🅺🅰 🅳🅴🅱🅱🅰🆁🅼🅰\n🖤 in Tripura with @tripura_insta_stylish, @ssss.leni, @tripura.fashionate.style, @tripuras_glamorous_people_, @tripura_journey_vlogger, and @debbarmashilpi54.

With the noise in my head, it's never lonely. However, we've all felt alone at some point in time when in reality we're not. Just like this flower wasn't. It may not have had another flower, just like itself, next to it, but it did have all the greenery it needed to add to its environment and beauty. You may have to face certain aspects of life alone, but don't confuse the battles you must fight alone with being lonely or deprived of love and care. You're always going to have people that care about you around you because being a part of your life is important to them.  Just like it's important to you to be a part of the lives of those you care about. Don't forget the people that silently cheer you on without being too loud or constantly reminding you of their existence. \n\n We often forget how much people mean to us or get so used to their presence that they don't stand out to us anymore. When this happens, it can feel like you're alone. Take out a minute to list out all the people you can stop talking to\/ never see again but don't want to. Are you being appreciative of these people? Are you too used to seeing them? Do they not stand out to you anymore because they're not the same as you are? Cherish all the good that's around you. You don't have to be chasing people around, but it only takes a few minutes to appreciate the good around you or simply tell someone 'i appreciate that you're part of my life'. Reach out to the people that think about\/remember you in the little things. Or people that you remember or think about in the little things. You've never been alone because of them even if their presence only contributed to a moment in your life. In this life, especially this year, nothing is a given. There is only now.\n\n#okaybye #lockdownlife #lockdown2020 #lockdowndiaries #covid19 #goodvibes #goodvibesonly #motivation","NumberOfLikes":6,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Donna Peris on August 16, 2020.

The fragrant of the biriyani in seeraga samba will beautifully spiced up with the aromatic masalas and the  juicy tender and soft meat.  For the perfect texture and taste, we should carefully choose the quality and quantity of ingredients such as aromatic spices, rice, fresh meat with fat,  yoghurt, ghee and the lemon juice.  The  fire, water level and time should also be considered.  When the best combinations of best comes together, we will get the best of best.\n\nMy secret tip for a perfect biriyani is, I wont add tomatoes. \nWhat's your secret of your perfect biriyani??? \n\nNote - I didnt record the making video, recipe can be shared upon request. \n\n#muttonbiriyani\n#biriyaniisbae #biriyanilover #biryani #biryanilovers #soulsomecooking #bliss #flavour #flavoursofindia #southindiancuisine #southindian #dumbiryani #muttondumbiryani #eatstagram #lockdowndiaries #foodstagram #foodblogfeed #foodbloggers #foodsofinstagram #instafood #instagood #instagram #mydailyplate #whatscooking #whatsonmyplate #chennaigram #foodiesofkerala #foodie","NumberOfLikes":33,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597574657,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 16 12:44:17 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"🇮🇳Independence day special Tricolour 🇮🇳🇮🇳\n\n#samsungm30s #lockdowndiaries #lockdown #lockdowntalent #gocorona #dombivalikar #family #families #familytime #familyiseverything #familyphotography #familylife #familyfun #familylook #familylove","NumberOfLikes":57,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Neel in Dombivli, India with @patekar.ashwini_11.

Then horror which we used to read in past came in reality for this generation... Pandemic. \nLockdown was imposed in short interval notice and in a snap sound of fingers, many found themselves jobless, trapped inside. Privileged as me just had to get ourselves keep confined to our spaces. Real struggle was for them whose life started daily with sunrise and bread earned by long day hard work. Now there was no work.\nAs a photographers' perspective, shoots got cancelled, project delayed or denied. After a few days of not shooting, we started searching way to pursue passion. Business meetings started on conference video calls. Few photographers came with a temporary solution of shooting on video calls. Facetime shoots, WhatsApp Call shoots, Google video shoots, Skype shoot came in existence... in a shell, Virtual Shoots. Ofcourse not good as actual shoot, but \"...dil ko khush rakhne ko ghalib ye khayal achchha hai...\", it became a trend amongst photographers.\nAfter initial denial, me too thought to give it a try. Talked to few people connected with me. Now I am sharing few results. \nI won't call myself as Photographer for these shots, just a director. \n--- \u2022\u2022\u2022 ---\nIn picture: @dikshadesire\n--- \u2022\u2022\u2022 ---\n#virtual #shoot #virtualshoot #facetime #facetimephotoshoot #whatsapp #videocall #portrait_vision #pictureoftheday #photooftheday #pursuitofportraits #portrait_today #portrait_mood #portraitphotography #portrait_shots #portraiture #mood #moodygrams #snapseed #lockdowndiaries #lockdown #coronatime #portraitvision_ #pr0ject_uno #pr0ject_soul #portraitphotographer #couch #red #faceshot #expression","NumberOfLikes":37,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597505708,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 17:35:08 CEST 2020","Location":"India"},{"CaptionText":"Cup of Joe🤎☕\n\n#coffeelover #coffeeaddict #barristalife #espressolove  #caffeinedaily #coffeefirst #coffeeoclock #elixir is #coffeequotes #coffeesesh #coffeemania #coffeemaniac #coffeeeveryday #lockdowndiaries  #coffeeaddict  #caffeineaddict #caffeinated  #coffeesesh #cofeelovers #coffeewoman #capuchino","NumberOfLikes":5,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by bronzed_affair on August 15, 2020.

First it\u2019s my way of journaling so i will remember what this weird \u201Cforced on us\u201D time was like (although I suspect I won\u2019t forget it!😄)\nIt\u2019s also for people to learn what a lockdown does and can look like. This is no holidays, no chosen way to travel nor move into a new place, this was all decided for us and we just have to make it work. \nI\u2019m not complaining, this is not hard, this is not ideal and has its challenges but we are all well and so far healthy. We are learning how to live together in a confine space with no outing whatsoever, no fresh air, little choice on what happens during the day, after months of living confined. This is not a time to compare and think of all the things that could be different. For me, it\u2019s time to keep focusing on what an amazing adventure it is for our family, all the greatness that is to come and share some fun time with those i love the most 👦🏼👦🏼👧🏼👱🏻\u200D♂️💞\nSo on the early morning of our 4th day, I\u2019m enjoying looking back at the photos of what made our 3rd day in lockdown amazing!\n\nFirst on the list, but not least, we managed to order 2 coffees and 3 babyccinos 🎉💞😋🎉 this was such a treat especially as we know we won\u2019t be able to enjoy this for the next 2-3 days. \nThen i connected my phone back so we can now call all our family and friends all over 👍. We therefor had lovely chats with a few of our favourite people 🥰\nWe also got to enjoy watching the rather wet and cloudy day unfold in front of our eyes. Clouds are fascinating and will make fun art projects over the next couple of weeks. \nOur amazing sister and brother in law dropped off a bag with pens\/pencils\/paper and a uno game (well there are a few more gems that will come out over the next few days) so we had lots of fun playing uno together. \nLastly we all attempted exercising for a bit. That wasn\u2019t successful but we are working on finding a routine in here and it\u2019s a first step the right way!\nAfter an almost normal night sleep, I can\u2019t wait for what this beautiful sunny Saturday has to offer 🥰😍\n\n#lockdowndiaries #expatlife #itsallgood #mybabiesaremyworld @glowwiththe.flo","NumberOfLikes":11,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Flo on August 14, 2020.

We love eating tacos and burritos, and under normal circumstances generally eat out at any of our favourite Mexican joints at least once a month. But with stage 4 lockdown and curfew in place, just stepping out for a walk has become a luxury. Hence we rustled up some of our favourite Mexican dishes right at home. The Mole sauce was sweet, tangy and o so gloriously spicy - with a subtle hint of the hard chocolate. But our favourite had to be the Pollo de fuego with the soft shell tacos - the charred bit of chicken with sauted bellpeppers is absolutely addictive. It wasn't the most authentic fare for sure but the dishes did a little Jarabe Tapatío on our taste buds! ♥️ \n\nIn the pictures: Mexican Mole, chicken in Mole sauce, Pollo de fuego, guacamole, salsa and sour cream, with hard and soft tacos.

However when you look closely, you\u2019ll be able to sense the emotions people must have associated with these seemingly random streets. These were the streets where the children of the old couple down the road used to play and the streets where the famous police officer found the love of her life on a rainyday. Places dont simply remain as walls, pillars and roofs. Maybe that\u2019s why we find it difficult to leave our hometowns, not because of the housing or the living amenities there but because we\u2019re afraid to leave behind the prospect of making future memories in those places with the people we love. Concrete, glass and wood grow into fond memories of times that have passed. When the children of that old couple visit their parents and that police officer comes back, all theyre going to be able to see is how much things change. They\u2019ll see old versions of themselves, clinging to the places and things they knew, afraid of change, and then, they\u2019ll resonate with the fact that change is inevitable. They\u2019ll walk back down those streets, with smiles on their faces, maybe even tears of reminiscence, seeing life for what it is, a strive for growth. Every place holds great meaning for someone or the other. Do those roads seem random to you anymore?\n\n- @_harjas._ \n\nGraphic By: @onuj_z.jpg \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n#graphicdesigning #graphicarts #graphicinspired  #inpiracionpoetica\n#prolificpoet #yanko #designforgood #designinspiration #aestheticdesign #designisinthedetails #designiseverywhere #designislife #designboom #proactiveprocrastinators  #designforgood #designerlifestyle #todaysthoughts  #nostalgiacore \n#selfcontemplation\n #beproductive #productivityhabits \n#quarantinedays #beproductive #doitnow #procrastinating\n#lockdowndiaries #lockdownart\n #wegotyou #dreamhigh #teenartist #teenwriters","NumberOfLikes":157,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Proactive Procrastinators on August 14, 2020 tagging @onuj_z.jpg, and @_harjas._.","NumberOfComments":40,"Timestamp":1597395375,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 14 10:56:15 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Does Instagram have to be full of happy smiley pics!? 😂 Mia was NOT impressed with having to temporarily wear clothes when we went out yesterday.

To yourself or to others? Have these words lost their meaning because of the constant use and no sign of anything getting better? I say this to everyone who is troubled in these times, which is everyone. And I caught myself saying this to a friend the other day and realising that it sounded hollow and even though I meant it I don't think my words had any hope in them. But that doesn't mean that I've lost hope, maybe I have, but what is life without positivity? When corona first struck, I remember being this positive person, bright as the sun, but as days went by, I also remember times of despair and feeling absolutely lost. But what matters is how much good you can get out of a bad situation. And how important it is to have even the tiniest bits of positivity. So, yes, I do hope that it does get better soon. Yes, hope is a strong word but it is also what keeps us going.

From the person who used to stay out 14hrs a day on average to the person who haven\u2019t even seen the roads for a month or two straight, not even to get groceries was an interesting turn of events. But I must say I am loving this now. I see a number of people putting out posts on social media about how they hate staying at home and not being able to meet their loved ones, and all fidgety to go back to that NORMAL life we had. I miss my other family consisting two people; girls with whom at least meeting every other fortnight was as necessity as breathing but it\u2019s been almost half a year that I have seen their faces and nothing feels miserable compared to that. I am a barista who hasn\u2019t had a sip of coffee since I volunteered to be on unpaid leave. And what is a barista without coffee eh? I was in a relationship where I felt drained even if it was just for few number of months and I ended up calling it off. I was so afraid to talk about it that deep inside I wished him to vanish rather than confrontation. Because I am never the bearer of bad news but the receiver. I was always at the other end of spectrum. I have cut off ties with people to whom my absence doesn\u2019t mean anything. I have limited my arena to such extent where now I only communicate with people who cares about my wellbeing. Was it that easy? Oh hell no! There were times where I was just gone  because nothing I said to them made me feel understood. I like to steer the wheel of my life hence, I distanced myself from people I love so that I can reach to my own conclusions. My friends always disliked that part of me, but they understood me too. At one point, finally this pandemic crawled under my skin and made me go insane. \n\n#tobecontinued #journaling #writing #writersofinstagram #booklover #tumblr #explore #pandemic #lockdowndiaries #novice #writerslife #thoughtsbecomethings","NumberOfLikes":2,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Oona 🍁 on August 13, 2020.

That's roughly how long many of us were in lockdown and some are in lockdown again ❤️. Spending a lot of time at home made me feel isolated and bored.

These little habits suddenly became something normal and I also put on weight. I have now reduced my sugar intake and when I crave something I portion it. When I want to have an alcoholic beverage, I look for the alcohol free option. In this way I still have alcohol, but a lot less than before. I now enjoy alcohol free beer and found even an alcohol free gin! I have also started drinking more water, which also helps with my well being.
