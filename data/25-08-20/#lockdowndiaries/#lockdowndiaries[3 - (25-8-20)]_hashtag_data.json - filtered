I have thought about this scene several times since. Grafton street is usually bursting with atmosphere, with musicians, singers, artists, tourists, shoppers and the general hustle and bustle of a capital city. All of them gone now. The ladies that sell the flowers 💐 have also departed. Usually at the top of Grafton street there is a queue of carriage horses waiting to transport tourists around the city, there was only one carriage. Shops have closed, and won\u2019t be reopening.\nI didn\u2019t know whether to post this or not and I had to think about it. I started my insta page as I wanted to post up beat images of simple things in life that get me through and make me happy and also maybe things that I had neglected to appreciate pre corona. I do think that it is important that people remember that ones\u2019 insta page may not be a true representation of the \u2018owner\u2019, it is only a segment of their lives. My aim was to create a page that appreciates the small things and helps me forget about the devastation the corona virus has caused. There are times when I think of how drastically life has changed and life pre corona... One thing I really miss is the soothing embrace of a good auld 🤗 hug (nothing beats that), the craic that was to be had in the pubs and going to a gig and dancing or standing in the audience squeezed in a sea of people. Ah the good old days....... I think we all have to be positive and do our best, we all have good and bad days!!! 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🙏🙏#graftonstreet #graftonstreetbuskers #graftonstreetdublin #dublin #dublinireland #dublinireland🍀 #dublinireland🇮🇪 #coronavirus #coronaviruspandemic #lockdown #lockdown2020 #lockdown2020 #lockdowndiaries #lockdownireland #coronavirusaftermath #effectsofcorona #covid_19 \n#covid19 #livingthroughcovid19 #bepositive #emptystreets","NumberOfLikes":15,"Hashtags":["#graftonstreet","#graftonstreetbuskers","#graftonstreetdublin","#dublin","#dublinireland","#dublinireland🍀","#dublinireland🇮🇪","#coronavirus","#coronaviruspandemic","#lockdown","#lockdown2020","#lockdown2020","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdownireland","#coronavirusaftermath","#effectsofcorona","#covid_19","#covid19","#livingthroughcovid19","#bepositive","#emptystreets"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @rebalancinglifesytle in Grafton Street.

So I have been using @kelloggsindia cornflakes in many different ways just to get over them.\n\nOne of my favorite street food is mumbai's bhelpuri. So I made tried to make a different variation of the bhelpuri using cornflakes. I have used the ingredients which were available at home.\n\nIn a bowl, add 1 chopped onion, 1 chopped tomato, 1 tbsp of chopped raw mango. For spicing the Bhel, I added coriander-mint chutney, amchur ki chutney, salt, chaat masala and squeezed half a lemon. Add chopped coriander or mint leaves. Give it a good mix and then add the cornflakes just before you want to have it. Else it will get soft (soggy).\n\nYour homemade bhelpuri or you can say crunchy chaat is ready to be enjoyed!\n\nIn place of raw mango, I used my ready raw mango instant pickle. You can check out my feed foe the recipe. The coriander-mint chutney and the amchur chutney are homemade and always readily available at home. DM me if you want the recipe. Also instead of chaat masala , I use this Mumbai special sandwich masala which my sis-in-law gets from Mumbai.\n\nDo try this easy-peasy recipe and let me know if you liked it or not 😊\n\nFollow @VegWithSanj \nFollow @VegWithSanj \nFollow @VegWithSanj \n\nFor repost request, use #vegwithsanj \n\n#bhelpuri #mumbaibhel #mumbaibhelpuri #bhel #bhelpurichaat #bhelpurilove #mumbaistreetfood #delhistreetfood #chaatrecipes #chaatrecipe #bhelpurirecipe #foodiesoffaridabad #foodiesofinstagram #foodiesofindia #chatore #chatorizubaan #quarantinecooking #quarantinerecipe #lockdown2020 #lockdowncooking #lockdowndiaries #quarantinechef #homemadechutneys #homechef #homemade #recipesofinstagram","NumberOfLikes":86,"Hashtags":["#recipevideo","#recipepost","#saveit","#vegwithsanj","#bhelpuri","#mumbaibhel","#mumbaibhelpuri","#bhel","#bhelpurichaat","#bhelpurilove","#mumbaistreetfood","#delhistreetfood","#chaatrecipes","#chaatrecipe","#bhelpurirecipe","#foodiesoffaridabad","#foodiesofinstagram","#foodiesofindia","#chatore","#chatorizubaan","#quarantinecooking","#quarantinerecipe","#lockdown2020","#lockdowncooking","#lockdowndiaries","#quarantinechef","#homemadechutneys","#homechef","#homemade","#recipesofinstagram"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1597254535,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 12 19:48:55 CEST 2020","Location":"Faridabad"},{"Owner":"sahil.saxena26","CaptionText":"Officially out of lockdown...swipe left to see the mess✌️#lockdowndiaries #newlook #newfeels","NumberOfLikes":47,"Hashtags":["#lockdowndiaries","#newlook","#newfeels"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1597254060,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 12 19:41:00 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"shaz.808","CaptionText":"With not travelling and taking cool pics, it's hard to figure out what content to give you guys.

These days, seeing the store-bought vegetables that are either rotten or stale, I wonder whether I should quit the job and start farming instead. To get fresh and non-toxic vegetables, one needs to put in their own efforts. Along with it, watching @manju.warrier's movie 'how old are you?', made a strong will in me to start growing veggies even if it's small level. Three months hence, to see one of my cute tomatoes turn red, there's immense happiness. Even if my 'farm' cannot guarantee a sack of vegetables, the efforts got paid off. \n\n#tomatoes #organicgardening #organicfarming #homegrown #balconygarden #kochidiaries #tomato #gardenlife #organic #farminglife #homegardens #vegetablegarden #vegetablegardening #lockdowndiaries #meengurrymemories","NumberOfLikes":27,"Hashtags":["#tomatoes","#organicgardening","#organicfarming","#homegrown","#balconygarden","#kochidiaries","#tomato","#gardenlife","#organic","#farminglife","#homegardens","#vegetablegarden","#vegetablegardening","#lockdowndiaries","#meengurrymemories"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Meengurry on August 11, 2020 tagging @gardenup.in.

He used to play with his friends around these trees in Vrindavan, holding the unique globular flowers of the tree. Hence the tree is also known as Haripriya, God\u2019s favourite. He is depicted as playing his flute under its canopy.........\n#photooftheday #photographylovers #photographer #photography #krishna #janmashtami🙏 #love #likeforlikes #lockdowndiaries #radhekrishna #radha #spreadlove #jaishrikrishna","NumberOfLikes":74,"Hashtags":["#photooftheday","#photographylovers","#photographer","#photography","#krishna","#janmashtami🙏","#love","#likeforlikes","#lockdowndiaries","#radhekrishna","#radha","#spreadlove","#jaishrikrishna"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by photomaan😉 in Go Corona with @streets.of.india, @streetphotographyinternational, @luckypaul509, @zonestreet, @mobile__photography___, @humbiharhai, @ithappensinbihar, @photoholic___________, @creative.arts_photography, @hindustani.photography, @blueartdephoto, @_conceptualize_photography_7_, @pixels.india, @sneha.wandererr, and @photography.lovers_1127.

Someone who comes to our rescue when we are in danger, the one who we can count on. \n\nIf we were to pick our favorite heros, for some they would belong to the reel life while for some they would come from different walks of real life. No matter who we choose to idealise, we look upto them, we strive to become like them, and measure our success in the same terms as theirs. \n\nAll in true spirit! But if I have to ask you, what's heroism to you, what would you say? Webster dictionary defines heroism as,  'heroic (courageous or brave) conduct especially as exhibited in fulfilling a high purpose or attaining a noble end'. Well it does takes to be more than ordinary to qualify as a hero, right? \n\nIf your answer to the above question is yes, then am sorry but I beg to differ. I think we have raised the benchmark a little too high to escape from realising our own responsibilities. We have labelled some tasks to be larger than life so that we can escape by being lazy or perhaps sloppy. \n\nHeros are ordinary people who act out of true honesty and dedication towards their duties. A teacher looking out for it's student's well being is a hero. A Doctor taking care of it's patients is a hero. A public servant carrying out his duty with utmost honesty is a hero.

It was on top of the game, finding ways to make the transition to online learning as smooth as possible. Parents, teachers & even students reached out to support one another with empathy.\nWhile being grateful for my privileges, I was not blind to what the rest of the country was facing. The surrounding hopelessness & misery was heart-wrenching. In this environment, I was grateful to be safe and secure at home. Out of this gratitude came the need to start living in the moment and enjoy doing little things. I started doing things I had put off for years. My whole professional life as a dance practitioner has been ridden with self-doubt and anxiety. I would think about doing things rather than risking doing them and having to face judgment and rejection, except on a few occasions. \nWhile I have overcome some of these fears in my lifetime, this lockdown however unleashed the artiste in me! I was on a roll; making videos, started an FB page, a secret blog for just my peace of mind, at my own pace with no desire to make it reach people!  I put my bathroom singing out in public, something I had never ever imagined I would do! I had the luxury to do little inconsequential things, as my income was secure. I am deeply saddened by the cost the world has had to pay during this lockdown, but it has been a period of growth for me. I am horrified at the thought of a fully technology-driven world, but I have personally reaped its\u2019 benefits.\n\n@mehneer  is a Performing Artist, Choreographer & Educator specializing in Contemporary & Jazz Dance. A founder member of Gati Dance Forum Delhi, she has presented her work at different festivals & taught at dance academies and schools in Delhi, Mumbai, UK, & Cambodia.

All variable, voluminous, and velocitous data have nothing to offer, unless you have the question you want them to answer. It's common sense, but they put it so poetically.\n\nPlus, there are historical anecdotes too like did you know that today, there is enough information in the world to give every person alive 320 times more than what historians believe to be stored in the Library of Alexandria in Egypt, which in the third century BC was believed to house the sum of human knowledge, the largest collection of recorded information in the ancient world?\n\nI have no compulsion to be a data scientist, but if it's interesting enough to propel me to the very end of this course and to the many other specializations under this program, who knows? So far so good.\n\nWhat is the mathematical expression for wishful thinking?\n\nI am awake enough to go into Week 2, but I have also just started reading \"The Tattooist of Auschwitz\" by Heather Morris and O x M x G = unputdownable!\n\n#nevertoolate\n#datascience\n#coursera\n#quarantinejournal\n#lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":13,"Hashtags":["#nevertoolate","#datascience","#coursera","#quarantinejournal","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by AA Patawaran in Manila, Philippines.

I'll never forget being nearly hate-crimed at a gas stop in West Virginia and didn't think much of my brother bringing a white companion on each of his cross-country road trips for safety. \n\nScotland 2017 was my first time in Europe; EVERY SINGLE person I spoke with about 'traveling while brown' in Europe had a story. \n- The Spanish call Central American travelers \"tercero-mundiales\" (3rd worlders)\n- Greece came up the most in anecdotal negative experiences...\n\nBasically I had low expectations, I've been treated like shit in Manhattan all the time, but low and below in Scotland I had zero experiences of micro-aggressions aka low-key racism, nor scary encounters with armed white men (this has happened to me in upstate NY, WV and Wisconsin). \n\nIt may seem super basic but it was so unusual to be treated kindly everywhere we went that we fell in love with the Scottish highlands. Now that American passports are getting a taste of our own medicine, we will just have to pinterest away until la próxima 😍\n\n#scottishhighlands #scotlandlove #sheepfordays #lockdowndiaries #travelersofcolor #queertravel #queertraveler #honestconversations","NumberOfLikes":80,"Hashtags":["#scottishhighlands","#scotlandlove","#sheepfordays","#lockdowndiaries","#travelersofcolor","#queertravel","#queertraveler","#honestconversations"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by jenny bale 🧸🏳️\u200D🌈 in Scottish Highlands.

Forex is definitely associated with a scam\/cash-loss label, however if you truly understand the markets, practice discipline and follow a tight risk management plan it is a legitimate way to earn extra money. The course is AMAZING, I\u2019ll do a proper review soon. What I love about forex is its flexibility - there are sooooo many different trading styles. When I head back to placement in a few weeks I\u2019ll be focusing on long-term trades which won\u2019t require daily effort. Please note, this is not a get rich quick affair! After completing the course I\u2019ve spent 3 months on a DEMO account, perfecting my strategies and discipline (emotional trading is a real thing 😭). I\u2019ll be starting my live account soon so will keep you guys updated ✌🏾\n⠀\n⠀\n𝙁𝙇𝙄𝙋𝙋𝙄𝙉𝙂 𝙋𝙍𝙊𝘿𝙐𝘾𝙏𝙎\n@gordontorks put me onto this a few weeks ago and I\u2019m eternally grateful 🙏🏾 It essentially involves sourcing high demand products from retailers at a bargain price and flipping them on eBay. I started this exactly 2 weeks ago with my boyfriend and we have made over £2.5k so far (revenue NOT profit). I love this because it\u2019s risk-free, if you don\u2019t sell a product you can just return it! Again, this requires effort (LOTS of driving around to source products, wrapping & shipping products, managing eBay listings etc) however it can be very lucrative if you\u2019re willing to put in the work 💪🏾✨\n⠀","NumberOfLikes":59,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":12,"Timestamp":1596994252,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 09 19:30:52 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"apurbacreat","CaptionText":"Choices are like fingerprints to be Unique\n#pencilsketch #lockdowndiaries #passion #artistsoninstagram","NumberOfLikes":22,"Hashtags":["#pencilsketch","#lockdowndiaries","#passion","#artistsoninstagram"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Apurba Pal on August 09, 2020.

My highlight today was buying a ten kilogram container of yogurt for eight dollars. That kept me busy in the kitchen for the afternoon - making labne, baking an orange and yogurt cake, and trying to find enough glass bottles to store the remainder in. My kitchen is my happy place (equal with my garden!), and it\u2019s where you\u2019ll most often find me.
