As a transman, I reached out to the LGBTQ+ community and used my article to voice their experiences, as well as my own. \n\u2022\nIt\u2019s important for transgender people to have a platform to speak out about some very real issues which affect us, such as dysphoria, and how adapting to COVID-19 has paused all-important medical appointments. I also featured the number of hate crimes and homelessness rates for LGBTQ+ youth in lockdown. \n\u2022\nThis link will go \u2018public\u2019 within the next few days as an SEO blogspot and in particular, my article, will be shared nationwide across all platforms involved with the Princes Trust. \n\u2022\nIf this is a topic you would like to read about (it is slightly lengthy, but you can find relevant information for you) then grab a cuppa and click the link! \n\u2022\n(Massive thanks again to everyone who supported my research, aided my background information and who continuously express love and warmth towards me! ❤️\n\u2022\n⬇️","NumberOfLikes":111,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by L U C I A N in Colchester, Essex with @stonewalluk, @princestrust, @wordpressdotcom, @lgbtfdn, @princes_trust_east_england, and @trans_luciant.

For somebody like me who was lucky enough to have never set foot in a hospital before; the amount of indescribable pain, the epidural not working four times, the near-emergency c-section that wasn\u2019t were all quite mentally damaging. This stuff caused flashbacks for months during my already sleep deprived nights.\n\/\/\/\nWe did however come home, counted our blessings and got on with the frenzied care of a newborn with the help of my parents who shopped, cooked, sterilised, did laundry for two weeks straight. We went on two date nights to satisfy my sushi craving and his Hawksmoor craving, and we even hosted a little Happy First Week party for Leo where he got to meet some of his family and friends.\n\/\/\/\nLittle did we know that party was the last chance anybody would get to hold him in their arms. We had a feeling something worse was down the line with corona and we started to self isolate before the lockdown.\n\/\/\/\nIt\u2019s now been officially 5.5 months of zero help from anybody. Not a single minute of babysitting. We\u2019ve watched friends and family in awe and disappointment as they bent the rules in their own little ways.

Our new series aims to motivate fellow runners and fitness enthusiasts by spreading stories of people who continue to stay motivated through the lockdown.\n\nHere is @alphaanu telling us how she found the encouragement to keep fit week after week.\n\n\"COVID-19 was sudden, swift and brutal. Being homebound anxiety & uncertainty loomed ahead. While wondering how to kickstart any physical activity to keep me upbeat, my ever inspiring mentor @ta.run_rw came to rescue with his virtual workouts and soon cardio, HIIT, kickboxing, yoga and Zuu triggered some semblance of normalcy. Days slipped into weeks and then months & the itch to break free grew stronger. In June I commenced my outdoor weekend runs. The motivation to meet fellow runners, to feel the fresh air and to remain fit persists. Masks, social distancing and sanitizers are the new normal and so is the need to rise to the challenge and conquer it.\" - @alphaanu\n.\nHave a similar story that you want to share?

Explaination 👇(please read patiently.. it worths it)🔖🤗🤗😊✌️\n\n🔖Sigmund Freud said that the mind is like an iceberg: One third is above the water \u2014 your conscious mind, and a good two-thirds is below the water \u2014 your subonscious mind\n\n🔖Let's say you're carrying a tray of glasses, and somewhere in the back of your head you start to think that you will drop it. \nSure thing you will! \n\n🔖Or you overslept in the morning and the rest of the day you are trying to catch up and one after another things go wrong. You've been there, right?! \n\n🔖This is not because you can't carry a tray and it is not because you are having a bad day. It is because in the back of your head, in your unconscious mind, you expect it to be that way. \n\n🔖If you're feeling stressed, insecure, angry, annoyed or any other negative feeling, you are thinking something negative. If that negative thought is not in your conscious mind it will be in your unconscious mind. Easy right? If you feel bad you're thinking something bad. And once you've established how you feel, you can start searching your unconscious for the bad thought. When you find it you're automatically making it a conscious thought and you can change it.\n\n🔖The thing you need to do is to make a conscious decision to make your unconscious conscious . That is, if you want to be aware of where you're are leading yourself in life. \nstart being aware of your feelings, at all times, small or big. \n\nFollow and share 👇🤗🤗\n@social_science_research\n.\n.\n.\n#socialscience #socialsciences #socialscientist #research #researchmethods #researchmethodology #humanpsychology #psychologyfacts #conciousminds #unconciousmind #subconciousmind #carljung #sigmundfreud #knowyourself #knowyourmind #psychology #psychologie #ssr #lockdowndiaries #socialscienceresearch #covid19 #coronatimes #beingcreative #creativity #sharingiscaring #helpothers #helpyourself #thesecret #scientificillustration","NumberOfLikes":18,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by SSRbriefly🔬 on August 06, 2020.

Then horror which we used to read in past came in reality for this generation... Pandemic. \nLockdown was imposed in short interval notice and in a snap sound of fingers, many found themselves jobless, trapped inside. Privileged as me just had to get ourselves keep confined to our spaces. Real struggle was for them whose life started daily with sunrise and bread earned by long day hard work. Now there was no work.\nAs a photographers' perspective, shoots got cancelled, project delayed or denied. After a few days of not shooting, we started searching way to pursue passion. Business meetings started on conference video calls. Few photographers came with a temporary solution of shooting on video calls. Facetime shoots, WhatsApp Call shoots, Google video shoots, Skype shoot came in existence... in a shell, Virtual Shoots. Ofcourse not good as actual shoot, but \"...dil ko khush rakhne ko ghalib ye khayal achchha hai...\", it became a trend amongst photographers.\nAfter initial denial, me too thought to give it a try. Talked to few people connected with me. Now I am sharing few results. \nI won't call myself as Photographer for these shots, just a director. \n--- \u2022\u2022\u2022 ---\nIn picture: @itsharshitaagarwal \n--- \u2022\u2022\u2022 ---\n#coffee #coffeedrinker #virtual #shoot #virtualshoot #facetime #facetimephotoshoot #whatsapp #videocall #mug #cup #portrait_vision #pictureoftheday #photooftheday #pursuitofportraits #portrait_today #portrait_mood #portraitphotography #portrait_shots #portraiture #mood #moodygrams #snapseed #lockdowndiaries #lockdown #coronatime #portraitvision_ #pr0ject_uno #pr0ject_soul #portraitphotographer","NumberOfLikes":52,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1596735837,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 06 19:43:57 CEST 2020","Location":"New Delhi"},{"CaptionText":"Wool art 😍 #artofinstagram #woolart #simplehomestyle #homedecorlovers #homedecor #instaart #ınstalove #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":4,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Arya & Praneesh in Trivandrum, Kerala.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1596735824,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 06 19:43:44 CEST 2020","Location":"Trivandrum, Kerala"},{"CaptionText":"Glass plate painting 😍 #glasspaintingart #artofinstagram #paintig_forever_art #instaart #ınstalove #lockdowndiaries #plateart","NumberOfLikes":6,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Arya & Praneesh in Trivandrum, Kerala.

For the next 6 weeks we\u2019re facing more heavily enforced restrictions, including a curfew. For a Sagittarius Rising like me, it\u2019s made me reconsider what a journey really looks like.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nAs of the last month I\u2019ve dedicated myself to a program called The Spiral, with this weeks session working with the heart chakra. Every week @theconnectedcreatress and I seek information about my current conditioning, what programs I\u2019m running in relation to each energetic space, and the corresponding stories and emotions. I also set new intentions to reset my experiences. How do I desire to feel, now? I\u2019ve had a few responses from friends stating how transformative or powerful, yet potentially daunting this sounds, but with little else to distract me, the journey of Spiral is pretty clear, and the integration has been sound. In fact, it\u2019s made the most sense to me to undertake this program in the current climate, since I know just how potent the current energy is, and what I\u2019ve already created from seeking support in my darkness. I intend to speak on these forms of support in more detail, but for now, the heart.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nIn this weeks session, which beautifully corresponded with my Venus Return, for the first time I experienced a certain amount of fear, even though we had just cleared my experience of \u2018Reason\u2019.\nReason, noun.\nThe power of the mind to think, understand, and form judgements logically.\n\"There is a close connection between reason and emotion.\u201D\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nThe question which surfaced fear for me was:\n\u201CHow will your relationships be impacted when you can keep your heart open at all times?\u201D\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nContinued in comments.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nArtist: Magdalena Korzeniewska","NumberOfLikes":35,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Candice Hopkins | Kallisti on August 06, 2020.

I am deeply listening to and singing out loud the spiritually illuminating verses of Kabir, Lal Ded, Gorakhnath, etc. I have also been sharing my work through social media handles and quite frankly these media have been working out quite well for me. I totally agree with the significance of live-ness, the interactive and corporeal nature of performance, and the performative space. Yet I cannot deny the reality of this moment either and what it brings, no matter how stifling it feels. Apart from the not-so-friendly situations, the lockdown has also brought a lot of solitude, in its true essence, which is beautiful and healing. This state of solitude has made me contemplate and meditate more, sing more, heal better & reach out whenever I feel like through virtual media. It will be beautiful to go out amidst real performative ambiance once more, but till then, I intend to use this time to create all that I can and keep healing myself.\n \n@dipanjali_artist, a PhD scholar from JNU, has been undergoing training in Hindustani Classical Music and Borgeet (Assamese devotional music) for the past 15 years. Lately, she has been taking pleasure in diving into diverse traditions of Bhakti and Sufi music of the subcontinent, both in research and in her musical practice. Here, she sings a Bengali folk song with cryptic mystical lyrics. Although it has a strong resemblance to the songs of Baul tradition, one cannot know for sure if it is from that tradition.\n\nIf you or your artist-friends have a story to share,\nconnect with us.\n.\n.\n.\n#ArtistsLockedIn\n#ArtistsoftheWorld #artistsupport #artistsupportartists\n#artistsinquarantine #artistsinpandemic #artistsinlockdown #art #artistsdiary #artistsofguwahati #artistsfromunderground #ArtistsinFocus #artistsoninstagram #Artistsincorona #Lockdowndiaries #Baulmusic #indianmusic #Bhaktimusic #musicoftheeast #music #musicinlockdown #indianartists #musicheals #covidmusic #musicians #musicfromassam #assam","NumberOfLikes":30,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1596713465,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 06 13:31:05 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"These little beans turned 3 on the 4th and it's safe to say it's been a manic couple of days.

I\u2019m troubled by the state of our society, by the pandemic and the lockdowns, thousands of jobs in my city gone, the loss of life in Lebanon, the news that a lovely woman I know has cancer, and a beautiful family that I follow on here have lost their home. There\u2019s so much heaviness, and we are all physically isolated from one another. We weren\u2019t meant to live this way. \n.\nWhen I\u2019m struggling with life I try to take a few moments to sit out on our back steps by myself with a coffee. It\u2019s so good to get some fresh air, and getting out of my house gives me a new perspective, literally and figuratively.  A little time for self-care and our family rosary really help too. \n.\nThe longer this lockdown goes on, the more I see the importance of a strong daily rhythm. When life is confusing and uncertain, it is good to get up and do our daily work, to keep our hands busy. Unable to move freely, I am drawing inspiration from the monastic life, from those cloistered religious who choose to remain in one place, and must live an ordered day within their walls with contentment and love. \n.\nFor the first time in my life I am consistently getting up early. I have surprised myself by enjoying it, and I\u2019m craving even earlier starts. For a confirmed night owl, this could only have been a grace given to me by God. \n.\nI managed to make another contribution towards my #everybitcountschallenge again and made these Vinegared Red Onions from the Ball Preserving Blue Book. I have eight jars to add to my pantry. I have no idea what these will taste like, but isn\u2019t the colour pretty?

With the arrival of Japanese workers in late 1800s, they brought Japanese influence on the dish, i.e. the use of ahi tuna and soy sauce.

But in dealing with the pandemic are we ignoring another pandemic that is slowly creeping it's way up in our society? \nYes your stress and panic is contagious as well. 😫😫😫😫😫\nIn the absence of a vaccine, social distancing and quarantine are the only way we have to flatten the corona curve. However they have their own problems. After all we are social animals so the quarantine and social distancing is giving rise to mental health concerns such as anxiety, anger, sleep disturbances,  depression and PTSD. \nAdditionally they are grappling with infection, boredom, frustration, inadequate food and financial losses. Medicos are focussing on physical health but we need to consider our mental health as well\nSo how do we put a stop to all this A few basic steps:-\n1) STOP judging those who have travelled abroad. They are already stressed. \n2) Keep yourself well hydrated and take a diet rich in protein. \n3) Exercise daily💪💪💪. There is no better stress buster. Downtown and use some online fitness apps. \n4) Limit your intake of caffeine and alcohol. \n5) Focus on the positives. Stay updated but avoid negative news reports. \n6) Stay connected with your loved ones.","NumberOfLikes":6,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Vinod in Chennai, India.

Through the centuries, rotis has remained the cornerstone of the Indian community and culture.\nThis flatbread has been a casual distraction to the meal itself, yet without fail, it heroically feeds and nurtures our soul. It\u2019s simple food, tugs at your heart, reminiscent of childhood meals for wraps, pizzas and the perfect remedy for sauce or gravy mopping situations. Eaten warm, sprinkled with sugar makes a lovely companion to your tea.\n.\nProfoundly this is the magic wonder of pantry staples, flour, salt and water. It\u2019s the kind of recipe that you can make at the top of your head, and once you\u2019ve made it, you\u2019ll know it\u2019s worth every time. Seductively soft, fluffy and totally irresistible! \n .\nThe roti fame is nowhere near waning, you can shop the link in bio for the recipe in my ebook.\n.\nFollow @foodiesof_cakewalk for more photos and ideas\/recipes.

I was so anxious about stepping back out into town. My reality is that I actually haven\u2019t been out parenting in the real world for months, easily December last year.

So after I had Freddie, I had weeks of slow recovery, unable to drive myself anywhere or carry my children, it\u2019s hard! Then I think I had maybe a week of being well enough to drive and the lockdown hit! The longer it\u2019s gone the more I\u2019ve doubted myself and those questions of self doubt started to resurface just like when I was a brand new mum. Worrying about everything, and anything, it seems like trivial worries from the outside but they become so big inside it just consumes you! Anyway, I braved it for him. And im so glad we did.

Give me sexy Orion over Gove the goblin any day. Plus, magic thrives in uncertain times (hello Dark Ages!)\n\nAnd there is something about being stuck in your own environment for months on end that shifts your focus to nature, the seasons, the stars. Makes you shriek when you spot a sunflower finally budding in the yard, see a goldfinch springing through the park with a breadcrumb in its beak, watch the clematis on the fence in the back alley growing at least three inches a day.\n\nThere's something about the sight of a long-haired cat the colour of demerara sugar curled up on a brick wall in the sun surrounded by gently waving pink cyclamen that makes me want to, I dunno, PAINT it. And I don't think I've painted more than a skirting board since I was 12.\n\nThings feel different. My senses are looking for different things.\n\nI've become obsessed with things that smell nice, fancy shower gels, expensive perfume samples, a child's freshly washed hair, line-dried sheets, the damp mulch of a forest, sun and salt on warm skin.\n\nI want to talk to the people I've loved my whole life, I want to make sure they're ok.\n\nFunny things matter. Important things matter? Life admin drops further down the back of the sofa. But life is lived and fully felt. Joy, wonder, grief, despair.\n\nAnyway, I've got some space this month, for the first time in a while. I write websites, blogs, articles, newsletters. I enjoy putting words into an order that makes the reader feel seen and heard. So if you're looking to outsource your words, drop me a DM and I'll weave you some magic 🌠💖","NumberOfLikes":54,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Penny Brazier ~ copywriter on August 04, 2020.","NumberOfComments":31,"Timestamp":1596562665,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 04 19:37:45 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Lockdown diaries\nDay 131\nWalvis Bay SPCA has the most beautiful babies who are in desperate need of love, attention and families.

My phone was stolen and I was taken to the ground. The Cape Town police are a bit intense. And I think they saw me as a silly tourist - as a bit of a joke.\u201D\nAfter this inauspicious start, Asad, who works in digital marketing, spent ten days visiting sites such as Cape Point and checking out the city\u2019s vegan restaurants. Then lockdown kicked in.\n\u201CIt was super strict. They arrested people for breaking the rules. You were only allowed out to go to the supermarket.\u201D\nHoled up in the Glen Boutique Hotel & Spa in Sea Point, Asad worked from his room. In his spare time he made friends with other visitors in the same position. He also got to know the staff.\n\u201CThe owner is amazing and the staff became like family,\u201D he said. \u201CI was upgraded for free to the penthouse and they gave us all free food too.\u201D\nIn spite of the generosity of the hotel, Asad is still paying for his extended trip in instalments. And he had to fork out for an expensive repatriation flight. He was relieved to return to Stratford, where he lives, but says that he now plans to take his laptop and travel around the UK whenever he gets the chance. He had only visited Brighton once before, but it was number one on his list. \n\u201CBrighton is an amazing place. I love the atmosphere and I wanted to try out the vegan food here,\u201D he said. \u201CSo far I\u2019d definitely recommend The Vurger Co - the New York Melt vegan burger is so good\u201D.\n#brightonandhove #brighton #hove #hoveactually #thenorthlaines #vurgercobrighton #vegan #veganbrighton #foodie #lockdowndiaries #lockdownlife #humanstories #repatriation #southafrica #documentingbritain #tourist #visitbrighton #flexibleworking #newnormal #strandedabroad #assaulted #victimofcrime #sillytourists #police #penthousesuite #penthouselife #thisisbrighton #brighton_ig #documentinglife #humanstories #humanrace","NumberOfLikes":94,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Brighton Peeps in Brighton North Laine's with @asadfki, @justinedesmondphoto, @theglenhotel, @thevurgerco, and @daisyoclee.

The idea was to make Masoor for a Pulao and then layer it with the rice and give it \u2018dum\u2019 . So made the Masoor, but decided to serve it separately (thought flavours may clash there) . And added the Chicken Cutlets, which in hindsight was not needed as the Masoor was very flavourful. And we didn\u2019t need another protein.

Fonts. 🤦🏻\u200D♀️ That\u2019s the level we reached today. \n\nLet\u2019s just say that today I went from feeling flat as a pancake to particularly \u201Cstabby\u201D. And I ate a lot of carbs. \n\nPMS may have been a factor here too. Does anyone else feel like this ronacoaster has amplified their PMS symptoms by about two thousand percent?! 🤔🤬\n\nWe\u2019ve been dealing with some kind of intense restriction here since March. SIX months. And I think that with every new \u201Cannouncement\u201D or change, there is then a wave of emotion to navigate once again. There certainly isn\u2019t any rule book here my friends. And just when I think \u201CI\u2019ve got this\u201D, they sling something new our way. 😏\n\nSo I think today, I\u2019m just still feeling the aftershock from the weekend and the latest round of restrictions (with a hefty dose of hormone thrown in for good measure!). \n\nI really need to hit reset. Shift myself out of this funk. Again. Oh how many times I said that over the past six months! But again, there\u2019s no guidebook for this. We just have to go day by day. \n\nAnd even though today won\u2019t make it into my \u201CTop Days in Iso\u201D, I actually can go to bed laughing at my ridiculously stroppy mood, sulky behavior, and hope that tomorrow may just bring a little shift in perspective. 🤞🏻\n\nI\u2019ve got this. \n\nUntil tomorrow,\nLove Amelia xoxo\nPs. @theskinnyfatman I\u2019m sorry I was a mole today. 😘","NumberOfLikes":44,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Amelia Williams on August 04, 2020.

Thrice a week, she would make us breakfast- Pohe, Upma and regular Thalipeeth. If we remembered to soak Sabudana the night before, the bonus would be Sabudana Khichdi. No brekkie variations beyond this. Sadly, in early 2018 she suffered a mild heart attack and stopped coming to work ( thankfully she survived that. Had an angioplasty and is well now). I was devastated coz our Maharashtrian breakfasts came to a grinding halt. Some weekends when the missus had time, she would make some Pohe when I craved it. Then I started ordering from the local Maharashtrian restaurant. That meant bulking up my order, to make it worth their while to deliver, so along with the pohe came fattening Batata Vadas, fried Kothambir Wadis etc. then COVID stuck... and Monday morning when I woke up and washed the Pohe to make Kande Batate Pohe, I realised how foolish I was to have deprived myself for over a year, of simple stuff like this. Seriously, DIY is the one big lesson I have gained, at least in the culinary department. So Upma, Pohe , Sabudana and all their variations I have picked up and don\u2019t need PM for. All that is left is Thalipeeth, which I shall tackle soon... but I do miss PM\u2019s cheerful \u201Cgood morning\u201D, her smiling face, no matter what, her bustling chatty presence and her clockwork like punctuality and regularity. Rain or shine, even on every festival (hers and ours) she was here to make sure our home was cleaned and ready. That breed is fast vanishing. 😩#lockdowndiaries #pohe #cookedbreakfast #indianbreakfast #mahasrashtrianfood","NumberOfLikes":26,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Mark Mathai on August 03, 2020.

I can\u2019t help but feel profoundly grateful for a warm home, two of my favourite people, the fact that we\u2019re all healthy\u2014the list goes on\u2014but at the same time, I am struggling! Three weeks of Stage 3 lockdowns only to have the clock reset and the six week countdown starts again.\n﻿\n﻿I\u2019m thankful that our government is taking these necessary steps, especially as there are some in our society, unfortunately, who have been skirting the rules. But I think that, for as much as we should be counting our blessings, it\u2019s also OK to recognise that you\u2019re not OK. I know I will be\u2014I have wonderful family and friends, and lots of projects I\u2019m excited to start on (brace yourself @dtbrunt)\u2014but right now, I\u2019m acknowledging that this news hasn\u2019t come easy.\n﻿\n﻿It\u2019s been really, really hard to hear of family members in hospital and know that there is absolutely nothing that will allow you to see them (we\u2019ve investigated every possible option). It is hard to see friends visiting the beach, eating out, visiting their family and friends. We took that for granted earlier this year when the lockdowns were lifted slightly (and, dare I say it, we\u2019ve all been taking it for granted for a very long time) but it\u2019s all these little things that I am very much looking forward to once all this is over.\n﻿\n﻿So while I take some time to process, I know there are a lot of people who might not have a support network. What\u2019s more, every Thursday, Dan and our church members pack bags of food and other basic items for people in our community who don\u2019t even have the resources to access simple toiletries. One of the things that has helped me since this whole pandemic began is to not focus on myself. If I can be a spot of kindness or a listening ear for someone else, I realise that I really don\u2019t have it as bad as I thought.\n﻿\n﻿So as we buckle down and prepare to head into this next round of lockdowns, please know that if you are struggling, my inbox is always open, and I am more than willing to chat. I got you, we got this, and what\u2019s even better, God\u2019s got us all (Isaiah 46:4) 🤍","NumberOfLikes":31,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Maritza Brunt on August 02, 2020.

Lovely customers again, the demographic is so wide here, so many interesting insights into diverse lives and experiences. Met a fab couple tonight: way too young to be teachers 😀, vegan pizza ordered and they told us that their lockdown was completely furloughed free time. They teach in an inner city school. No point in online lessons, most of their pupils have little access to the digital world, few have more than one computer in the house, and the school quickly realised that teaching via a mobile phone was unfeasable. But they are hopeful and optimistic about the autumn term, they will pick up where they left off and scoop those kids up back into learning. We asked the question Pubs vs Schools and they laughed and said that honestly both were doable, and besides, after a difficult week they deserved a beer or two. Second that.

I found a place which made me feel so much peace, and brought back a moment of my life when I felt that way, I didn\u2019t dare to interrupt that moment to take a pic.

It can be added in soup, pastas, salads and blends very well. \nSo do try this and let me know your suggestions.. 😍\n\nRecipe:\n1. Cut length wise zucchinis into half and scoop out the flesh leaving 1\/2 an inch all around. \n2. Mash the scooped out flesh. Heat oil in a pan,  add garlic, your choice of veggies, herbs and saute for 5min.\n3. Fill zucchinis with filling and layer mozzarella cheese on top of it. \n4. Bake at 200deg C for 15-20 minutes and ready to be devoured 😁\n\nThis recipe is my contribution to the ongoing contest #wrapitorwichit \nOrganized by @shrutiz_kitchen_journey @jshraddhagaurav @myhungryrambles @thechefbychance \nSponsored by @blablafoodz @tpbspicesjodhpur \nFeaturing partner @yesindia @yesindiafoods \n\nI further nominate @payalaviani @komalagarrwal @niks_ash \nto participate...\n\n#NehaTheDentistGram #f52 #f52gram #foodstyling #foodie #foodstagram #foodpicoftheday #foodpicture #foodphotographer #foodstylist #zucchinirecipes #foodphotography #foodporn #foodiesofinstagram #bakersofinstagram #bakersfield #bake #buzzfeast #zucchiniboats\n#yummy #yummyinmytummy #dinnerrolls #bread#feedfeed #amazing #lockdowndiaries #healthylifestyle #bakers #pictureoftheday","NumberOfLikes":48,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":15,"Timestamp":1596383859,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 02 17:57:39 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Ashy Prinia - our noisy neighbour knows how to pose ! \n==============================================\n#birdphotography\n#birding #birdsofig\n#birdwatchers \n#birdwatching \n#myphotography\n#birds #photography \n#natgeo #natgeoyourshot\n#lockdowndiaries\n#hobby #instagood\n#portraitphotography\n#portrait #indianbirds\n#bird_captures \n#feather_perfection \n#planetbirds\n#bestbirdshots\n#wildlifephotography\n#backyard \n#photooftheday\n#photographers_of_india \n#birdlife #birdlovers\n@natgeo\n@raw_birds \n@birdwatchingmagazine\n@birdsonearth\n@planetbirds\n@best_birds_of_world \n@birdphotographers_of_india\n@natgeoyourshot\n@birds.nature \n@birds_photography_offical\n@birdphotographyworld","NumberOfLikes":350,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Prasad Hastak in Incredible India.
