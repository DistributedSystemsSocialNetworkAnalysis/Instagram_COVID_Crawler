At first this seemed too difficult, as we are deep in winter here, and I assume there\u2019s not much to be found in the garden. However, after wandering my yard, harvest basket and scissors in hand, I came inside with a huge haul of lavender, herbs and greens. I\u2019ve hung up bunches of oregano and rosemary to dry, Bonnie popped the flowers in a vase, and the greens went in the fridge to deal with tomorrow. Some I\u2019ll cook for breakfast, and the rest are going into my dehydrator. \nI learn many lessons from gardening.

I guess it\u2019s mostly about taking back the power. To not allow anyone else to dictate what part of you is pretty and what isn\u2019t, even if you yourself struggle with insecurities. The feeling of empowerment, of being in control of how you feel about yourself, is way more stronger than the feeling of being assumed pretty by the world. Once you get there, there\u2019s nothing holding you back. So here I am, with the widest smile. Knowing full well that it may not be perfect, but it\u2019s mine to own. Mine to judge. And mine to love.","NumberOfLikes":115,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":36,"Timestamp":1596352621,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 02 09:17:01 CEST 2020","Location":"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia"},{"Owner":"amit.bhuchar","CaptionText":"City rush.

But the basic thing is that he is very much afraid of being lonely. Loneliness is a black hole, a darkness, a frightening negative state almost like death \u2026 as if you are being swallowed by death itself. To avoid it, you run out and fall into anybody, just to hold somebody\u2019s hand, to feel that you are not lonely\u2026 Nothing hurts more than loneliness.\nBut the trouble is, any relationship that arises out of the fear of being lonely is not going to be a blissful experience, because the other is also joining you out of fear. You both call it love. You are both deceiving yourself and the other. It is simply fear, and fear can never be the source of love. Only those who love are absolutely fearless; only those who love are able to be alone, joyously, whose need for the other has disappeared, who are sufficient unto themselves\u2026\n\nThe day you decide that all these efforts are failures, that your loneliness has remained untouched by all your efforts, that is a great moment of understanding. Then only one thing remains: to see whether loneliness is such a thing that you should be afraid of, or if it is just your nature. Then rather than running out and away, you close your eyes and go in. Suddenly the night is over, and a new dawn \u2026 The loneliness transforms into aloneness.\n\nAloneness is your nature. You were born alone, you will die alone. And you are living alone without understanding it, without being fully aware of it.

And you can see, if you scroll down, they took my Mandala to a whole new level. \n\nDuring this lockdown, all I had was my simple black pen (since all of my stationery\u2019s at my hostel, in Delhi). For a long time, I couldn\u2019t order them on Amazon either. \n\nSo, here\u2019s another Mandala that I\u2019d made during the Lockdown using a simple #blackpen.

Baking banana bread? Does this life in lockdown story sound familiar? Like many of us, Lydia has found lockdown has given her an opportunity to slow down and focus on things that are important to her and make her happy. As a Christian and member of the Regent Hall church family, one of things that has been important to Lydia has been connecting with God and others by praying and reading the Bible with friends.\n.\nLydia came to Regent Hall when she started her medicine degree five years ago. During lockdown, Lydia has volunteered at her local GP surgery. She called patients who were shielding, offering practical and wellbeing support and advice. She says: \u201CI am just so grateful to God that I was given that opportunity just to play a small role in those people\u2019s lives.\u201D\n.\nLydia is about to start a university placement in a hospital and asks that we pray for her and her fellow students - that they will be safe, useful and helpful during this difficult time.\n.\nWatch Lydia\u2019s life in lockdown testimony in Sunday worship from 26 July on our YouTube channel.

(FB PAGE : Binal's collection of Short Stories and Quotes)\n\nOnce upon a time, there lived a tailor and her son. One day, due to school holiday, the son visited his mother tailor's work-place. \nBeing too young, his mother made him sit on a stool nearby, at a distance from where they could both see each other. Son saw that his mother would use scissors to cut the clothes, and then would keep aside the scissors besides her feet. Then she would sew clothes with the needle and thread, and after sewing would keep the needles on the scarf worn on the head. \nAfter looking on this sequel for half a dozen times, the son went over to his mother, and said \"May i ask you a question mother?\" Mother replied 'Yes son, what do you want to ask?'\nSon - \"Mother, i am seeing you since a long time. When you cut the clothes, after that you tuck the scissors below your feet; and after you sew the clothes, you keep the needles on your head. Why so?\" \nThe answer which his mother gave,  seemed like she gave an entire life's lesson to her son in two lines. \nMother answered lovingly, \"Son, the scissors work is to cut, and needles work is to sew; And a cutters' place is always down(below), but a sewers place is always at the top. This is the reason that i keep the needles on my scarf and scissors below the feet.\" \n\nMoral:\nIf in Life one wants to reach to the Top, Then one should be Like a Needle and SEW, and not be a Scissor (cutter).\n\nDo like, share and comment this story.\nVisit this section, for more such stories and Quotes at \nFacebook.com\/storiesandquotes1\nAnd\nHappy Reading 🙂\n\nFollow me @artbyforam for more of such arts❤\n.\nDM for Order!\n\n#pencilsketch #realisticdrawing #sketch #sketchartist #pencildrawing #art #artist #artwork #artistsoninstagram #artistsofinstagram #artoftheday #artofinstagram #sketchbook #sketching #sketches #sketchbookdrawing #sketchoftheday #sketchdaily #sketchaday #sketchart #sketchers #pencil #pencilart #pencils #potrait #lockdowndiaries #darshanraval #bluefamily #Darshaners #singlepencilsketch","NumberOfLikes":31,"Hashtags":["#pencilsketch","#realisticdrawing","#sketch","#sketchartist","#pencildrawing","#art","#artist","#artwork","#artistsoninstagram","#artistsofinstagram","#artoftheday","#artofinstagram","#sketchbook","#sketching","#sketches","#sketchbookdrawing","#sketchoftheday","#sketchdaily","#sketchaday","#sketchart","#sketchers","#pencil","#pencilart","#pencils","#potrait","#lockdowndiaries","#darshanraval","#bluefamily","#Darshaners","#singlepencilsketch"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1596119988,"LocalDate":"Thu Jul 30 16:39:48 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"nilufar__16","CaptionText":"#thursday  #thursdaymotivation #lockdowndiaries #lockdownsessions","NumberOfLikes":19,"Hashtags":["#thursday","#thursdaymotivation","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdownsessions"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Nilufar Matin in Gauhati.

Caught in a sudden spell of rain I roamed around the city parks and roundabout soaking in the beauty that Delhi is. These occasional outings were my only solace, my lifeline. They were also an opportunity to meet my boys, friends, eat out or just sit in silence somewhere, unseen, unheard. Modt of the other times i live in a perpetual lockdown. That's one reason this lockdown didn't feel unfamiliar. That said, I never realised that a catastrophe was waiting to unfold. \n\nI became unwell a few days later(though I'm better now). Acute anemia caused by excessive bleeding (perimenopause)  that left me feeling like a rag and except for a few visits to docs\/labs\/hospital I was forced indoors, confined to the house. \n\nCall it (my) good fortune that i had to stay back at my son's home in a beautiful part of Delhi, in the midst of greenery and those I love. The young adults (both boys & their partners) did their best as caregivers, a difficult task in times of WFH, lockdown and other factors. \n\nIt's been two months since I returned to this house. 5 months since I stepped out, went to my favorite places, city streets, parks etc. More than this the weight of uncertainty about future, feeling of unwantedness and lack of an anchor or a linchpin in life is pushing me down the rabbit hole. It's been revealing last few months. For all of us.\n\nFor the first time I have this dread that this forced lockdown with new set of rules is going to last very very long. I may step out in a few days but everything seems meaningless now in front of the gaping dark that is filling the hollow of my bones.

Chapra is a small district in bihar, a Bhojpuri spoken district. If you have ever been to Chapara, you will agree with that the way people of chapra eat sattu, you will not see it anywhere.Like all food lover city, chapra has the famous, puri sabhi and jalebi breakfast,and many hotals serve meat bhaat and machli bhaat.\n\nAnd then in the evening you will get the famous little champ( chop), near Hathua Market, or close to Pankaj Cinema road. There are lots of food cart serving these dishes.\n\nChamp piece of mutton is cooked initially in aluminium vessel and then finishe on large cast iron tawa. It\u2019s spicy with lot of garam masala. It\u2019s not only delicious but the combination itself is killer.\n\nSo finally after thinking about making it for long, I managed to do it. Unfortunately, Delhi doesn\u2019t have small goat meat in the shops, otherwise the final dish would have been more succulent and soft.\n\n#theurbanescapades\n#urbanescapades\n#EatWithShylock\n#lockdowncooking\n#lockdownrecipes\n#lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":101,"Hashtags":["#theurbanescapades","#urbanescapades","#EatWithShylock","#lockdowncooking","#lockdownrecipes","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1596085467,"LocalDate":"Thu Jul 30 07:04:27 CEST 2020","Location":"Safdarjung Enclave"},{"Owner":"thebongeyedentity","CaptionText":".\n𝕿𝖍𝖊 🄻🄾🄲🄺🄳🄾🅆🄽 𝕻𝖔𝖘𝖙\n.\n.\nthe baking breaks continue...\nthis time it's the chocolate chunk snack cake...! 🥮🍫\n.\n.\nthe perfect blend for that sweet soft yet chocolaty treat...! 😍\n.\n.\n#thebongeyedentity #food #foodie #foodaholic #foodlover #foodlife #foodstagram #foodiesofinstagram #foodblogger #foodblog #foodbloggersofindia #fboi #foodpics #foodphotography #foodography #foodtalkindia #mumbaifoodie #foodreview #foodart #culinary #culinaryarts #lockdowndiaries #homefood #bakeathome #homebakedcake #chocolatechunkcake","NumberOfLikes":114,"Hashtags":["#thebongeyedentity","#food","#foodie","#foodaholic","#foodlover","#foodlife","#foodstagram","#foodiesofinstagram","#foodblogger","#foodblog","#foodbloggersofindia","#fboi","#foodpics","#foodphotography","#foodography","#foodtalkindia","#mumbaifoodie","#foodreview","#foodart","#culinary","#culinaryarts","#lockdowndiaries","#homefood","#bakeathome","#homebakedcake","#chocolatechunkcake"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":9,"Timestamp":1596085335,"LocalDate":"Thu Jul 30 07:02:15 CEST 2020","Location":"Mumbai, Maharashtra"},{"Owner":"glamorous_jewellery_","CaptionText":"Happy Client❤\n. \n@glamorous_jewellery_\n. . \n#happycustomer #happyclients #happyclient #happycustomers #happycustomerhappyme #happycustomer #happydeals #satisfiedclient #satisfiedcustomer #cravingssatisfied #cravings #craving #cravingsatisfied #lockdown #lockdown2020 #lockdowndiaries #lockdownchallenge #parcelopeningvideo #parcelopening #parcelopeningvideos #surprisegift #surprisedelivery #surprisebox #surprisebdaygifts\n#rakhi2020 #rakhigifts #clientreview #clientoftheday #clientdiaries #clientappreciation #clientdiary","NumberOfLikes":14,"Hashtags":["#happycustomer","#happyclients","#happyclient","#happycustomers","#happycustomerhappyme","#happycustomer","#happydeals","#satisfiedclient","#satisfiedcustomer","#cravingssatisfied","#cravings","#craving","#cravingsatisfied","#lockdown","#lockdown2020","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdownchallenge","#parcelopeningvideo","#parcelopening","#parcelopeningvideos","#surprisegift","#surprisedelivery","#surprisebox","#surprisebdaygifts","#rakhi2020","#rakhigifts","#clientreview","#clientoftheday","#clientdiaries","#clientappreciation","#clientdiary"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1596085290,"LocalDate":"Thu Jul 30 07:01:30 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"ttaiiy","CaptionText":"Some moves!

The trick to making Kale smoothies taste great is to add plenty of sweet fruits to mask the bitter taste 😍\n\nThis recipe makes 2 large servings.

Initially, it starts with a lack of interest, motivation, or tiredness, later it progresses onto a habit. It is important to understand the impact it can cause on your daily routine and life in general.\nWhen your laziness becomes a shackle for you and prevents you from achieving your daily goals, it is important to get rid of it as s0oon as possible in the best possible way. Here are some methods to do so:\n\n- Find your motivation, look for what truly pushes you out of your lazy zone\n- One step at a time, proceed slow and steady\n- Get some physical exercise\n- Divide your big tasks into smaller ones\n- Keep an optimistic outlook and look for such examples\n- Contemplate on the consequences of avoiding the completion of your important tasks\n- Visualise your jobs and tasks to complete, make a to-do list\n- Set personal deadlines\n- Visualize your jobs and tasks to complete, make a to-do list\n_\n\nVisit us at www.cowin.live\n_\n\n#cowin #global #covid19 #who #pandemic #lockdown #globalpandemic #coronavirus #HealthForAll #stayhome #staysafe #socialdistancing #safetymeasures #awareness #lockdowndiaries #quatantine #homebound #unitednations #technology #tech #TechnologyForGood #techstartup #techsolution #instatech #appdesign #healthcare #quarintinelife #canada #globaleconomy #indianeconomy","NumberOfLikes":10,"Hashtags":["#cowin","#global","#covid19","#who","#pandemic","#lockdown","#globalpandemic","#coronavirus","#HealthForAll","#stayhome","#staysafe","#socialdistancing","#safetymeasures","#awareness","#lockdowndiaries","#quatantine","#homebound","#unitednations","#technology","#tech","#TechnologyForGood","#techstartup","#techsolution","#instatech","#appdesign","#healthcare","#quarintinelife","#canada","#globaleconomy","#indianeconomy"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Collective Win on July 29, 2020.

As mentioned in the first post, in case you missed out on these and are interested or know someone who would be, let me know in the comments below! 💌\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#workshoppost #creativeworkshops #DoodlingWorkshop #onlineworkshop #learndoodling #supportsmallbusiness #supportlocalbusinesses #smallbusinesslife #smallbusinessowner #creativejunkie #creativeactivity #creativepreneur #mycreativecommunity #mycreativeprocess #feedbackpost #lockdowndiaries #worldofartists #journallove","NumberOfLikes":132,"Hashtags":["#workshoppost","#creativeworkshops","#DoodlingWorkshop","#onlineworkshop","#learndoodling","#supportsmallbusiness","#supportlocalbusinesses","#smallbusinesslife","#smallbusinessowner","#creativejunkie","#creativeactivity","#creativepreneur","#mycreativecommunity","#mycreativeprocess","#feedbackpost","#lockdowndiaries","#worldofartists","#journallove"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":13,"Timestamp":1596006150,"LocalDate":"Wed Jul 29 09:02:30 CEST 2020","Location":"Mumbai, Maharashtra"},{"Owner":"londongreekradio","CaptionText":"As we all try to return to some kind of normality, let's say a big \"thank you\" to the LGR presenters who have kept you informed, updated and entertained in the last six months! \n\n@john_agiaslari, @arisdemis, @mihalisg, @yianniseye, @djmagis, @djandreasm, @katerinanlgr, #TonyNeophytou, @pierrepetrou1 #FaniPotamiti, @djchris_hrs #SoullaViolaris\n\n#LondonGreekRadio #LiveRadio #RadioPresenter #GreekMusic #LDN #LondonCypriots #LondonGreeks #GreekRadio #Radio #RadioBroadcast #RadioStation #FeelGoodMusic  #BestGreekMusic #FavouriteTunes #RadioDJ #LondonRadio #MusicUp #TuneIn #LondonLockdown #LockdownDiaries #LockdownParty #IsolationDiairies #LockdownDiary #LondonRadioStation #RadioDJ #LockdownMusic #CoronavirusNews","NumberOfLikes":108,"Hashtags":["#TonyNeophytou,","#FaniPotamiti,","#SoullaViolaris","#LondonGreekRadio","#LiveRadio","#RadioPresenter","#GreekMusic","#LDN","#LondonCypriots","#LondonGreeks","#GreekRadio","#Radio","#RadioBroadcast","#RadioStation","#FeelGoodMusic","#BestGreekMusic","#FavouriteTunes","#RadioDJ","#LondonRadio","#MusicUp","#TuneIn","#LondonLockdown","#LockdownDiaries","#LockdownParty","#IsolationDiairies","#LockdownDiary","#LondonRadioStation","#RadioDJ","#LockdownMusic","#CoronavirusNews"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by London Greek Radio in London Greek Radio.

I used this time to do more yoga and meditation, which in my opinion kept me sane in these stressful times. I practiced more and tried to develop my ability to use mental practice and planing better, and lastly, I kept in touch with the people I love the most.\n.\n@katrin.spiegel will play at #youngeuroclassic2020 on August 3, serving you some #mozart amongst others.
