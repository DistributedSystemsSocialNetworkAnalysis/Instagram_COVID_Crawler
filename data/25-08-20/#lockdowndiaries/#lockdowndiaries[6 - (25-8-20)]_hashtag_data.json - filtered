But when you're a CA student who has to read a ton, simple reading ain't gonna cut it. So I used the time I got during the lock down to learn how to speed read. Sounds simple right? Not quite! Takes a lot of practice before you can read fast and comprehend what you've just read. Now I can read about 235 words per minute.\n.\n.\nWe've all been affected by this pandemic.

Until the past week or so I really couldn\u2019t find balance throughout lockdown. As a hyper sensitive empath the hurt and death of other people hangs around me, the not knowing and not being able to do things I love makes me feel flat. The fact I\u2019ve lost so much weight and muscle from lack of my beloved barbells makes me almost angry after working so hard.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t have the added worry of being vulnerable, being Black and\/or Disabled (and therefore more likely to suffer from C19), I\u2019m not at risk of losing my job and if I did I\u2019d have the funds to secure us for a while. I have a supportive partner and access to free healthcare. \n\nThat\u2019s not to say my problems should be compared. I think we often miss the point when we think of other peoples suffering in comparison it to our own. Every single persons varying struggles are valid. But if we fail to acknowledge that of others too then we fail those people.\n\nLet\u2019s do better to consider ourselves and the people around us, even though restrictions are lifting around the world, millions of people are still at risk. \n\nLet me know some good things you\u2019ve been up to during lockdown? \n___\nAlt text: a white arm wearing a silver bangle reaches the flowing leaves of a Willow tree.","NumberOfLikes":50,"AccessibilityCaption":"a white hand wearing a silver bangle reaches the flowing leaves of a Willow tree.","NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1595881418,"LocalDate":"Mon Jul 27 22:23:38 CEST 2020","Location":"Islington"},{"CaptionText":"Kudos to #rhythmwinery for their #delicious Alphonso #sangria #recipe\n\nWe #mixed #alophonsomango #wine with sugar syrup , #vodka , #kesar and #alphonso #mango pieces and topped it with sparkling water\nü•≠.\nüç∑.\nü•≠.\nüç∑.\n#lipsmacking #tropical #tropicalsangria #mangoes #mangowine #cocktails #summercocktails #afternooncocktails #cocktail #winelovers #mangolovers #winestagram #sangriasundays #sundayfunday #quarantineandchill #lockdowndiaries #weekendfun #drinkoftheday #mixology","NumberOfLikes":40,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by SK & PK #globaltummies in London, United Kingdom with @rhythm_winery, @viruvalgevodka, and @redrickshawfood.

Hope this helps you in some manner, Sharing this from my personal experience. \n\n\u2022Affection : Start with things Your child is fond of,Every child is fond of some toy or some book, So to start with make an activity around it ,so soon he will join you.\n\n\u2022Bribe : A child's attention span is less than 20 minutes, so bribe them with chocolate, cookies or their favourite sticker, smiley or star. So they will finish their task fast as they can. So that they get their reward. \n\n\u2022 Build curiosity : Every child is curious and have many questions in mind,Prepare the activity in front of them. In a polite manner just say \"Can u please help me\" If they ask what is it, just say it's a surprise game for them, kids loves surprises. \n\n\u2022 Visual communication: Show and read a lot of pictorial books, Do a lot of picture talk because kids grab visuals more than verbal.  Reading helps in building child's vocabulary.\n\n\u2022 Appreciation:  Always appreciate and encourage these little ones whether they are doing their work well or trying it, always pat their back and say you are doing a GOOD JOB. \"Keep it up\"\n\n\u2022Be patient: Spending whole day working we tend to get tire & frustrated, after that we sit with our child to study and they don't listen to ours or run away, we tend to lose our patience and give it up, don't give up, keep trying and make studies fun them, they will sit one day with ours\n\n\u2022Parents are First Teacher :Parents know their child better than anyone else. As they spend more time with ours and imitate whatever we do, so beware of your actions. Our kids don't have anyone else, except ours, so remove some time in between from your busy schedule, talk to them, play with them, dance, sing, read and do all the madness in what they enjoy. Trust me the smile on your child's face will make your forget your entire day's tiredness and get a smile on your face too. \n\n#panicmommie #stories #lockdowndiaries #beattheboredom #fun2learn #tips","NumberOfLikes":33,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":6,"Timestamp":1595784933,"LocalDate":"Sun Jul 26 19:35:33 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#taabeerlockdown #lockdowndiaries #lockdownlife #lockdown2020 #shotoniphone #delhidiaries #aftersunset #aftersunsetphotography #coronavacation #shadowwork #shadowshoot @vivre.hinducollege","NumberOfLikes":23,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Amit shokeen on July 26, 2020.

Only weeks after the U.K. included Spain on a list of countries safe for summer holidays, the government reversed course and announced late Saturday it would impose a 14-day quarantine on anyone arriving from Spain. The move came after cases in the country jumped, particularly in the Catalonia region, where authorities are racing to stamp out new outbreaks. Norway on Friday announced a 10-day quarantine for people returning from Spain, and France issued new travel warnings for the Catalonia region, which is home to Barcelona and popular beaches. The moves will further weigh on bookings in the peak travel period for a country that depends on tourism for more than 10% of gross domestic product. Spain\u2019s health ministry reported more than 920 new cases on both Thursday and Friday, the highest numbers since early May, when the government began easing one of Europe\u2019s strictest lockdowns.\n.\n.\nDo follow and share @the_recent.column for latest updates.\n.\n.\n#spain #spainstagram #spaingram #instaspain #recentnews #recentcolumn #worldgram #worldnewsdaily #worldnews #europe #european #pandemic2020 #covid19 #covidnews #florida #norway #barcelonaspain #barcelona #france #uk #french #catalonia #cataloniaroyaltulum #lockdown #lockdown2020 #lockdownlife #lockdowndiaries #tourism #spain_photographs #spain_passion","NumberOfLikes":9,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The_Recent.Column on July 26, 2020.

Machines have started to slowly replace the traditional method of rice cultivation but a field with a wooden yoke and a pair of ox has a charm of its own! üòÄ\nRice is a staple food for the people of the hilly regions. To grow our own rice is a great way of being self sustainable. We allow small farmers to work in our fields. They put all their knowledge and experience into the fields thus helping us and themselves in the process and also saving a dying form of agriculture.\nPloughing a field, especially when there are small terraces is a tricky and challenging task.

Here's her 'lockdown' story:\n\nMy baby and I sitting in the balcony watching the sunset along the horizons of the Periyar river where boats paddle across its streams, is our usual evening. In the initial days of the lockdown, I was hopeful that everything will soon get back to normal. But my hopes were crushed by mid-April when Covid cases in India started spiking. \nMy husband - a navigational officer, left to sail months ago knowing that he would miss our baby\u2019s little milestones, with hopes of reuniting with us by mid-July. I was eagerly waiting for him to return at least by the time she starts walking. But it sure looks like he is going to miss that too as the sailors could only reach back home when the international flight operations resume. As the wait for this global stand-still to end continues - I miss him. It pains me to see our baby play every day without even realizing she has a father who on the other side is sailing the oceans, eagerly waiting to come home to her. I constantly realized how important it is to not take what you have for granted as for us, spending time together as a family seemed a luxury. It has been almost three months since we went out or had any visitors. Friends and family stayed away in concern of the baby. But now I am perturbed as she is starting to show stranger-anxiety at the mere sight of people passing by. \nThis lockdown helped me immensely in changing the way I perceived the world. I learnt it takes just a microbe to bring us humans to our knees and discovered the power of nature to restore itself. People who never once slowed down in their lives are taking a break. These days my husband and I, though shores apart, are co-writing an autobiographical fiction and we are looking forward to get it published by the end of this year. My baby and I still wait here looking forward to little things like these which means the world to us. After all, this is what hope is all about, isn\u2019t it?\n\n@anjoalphonse #journal_hope #hope #love #stayhome  #change #survival #pandemic  #family #baby #parents #sailing #lockdowndiaries #instagood #quarantine","NumberOfLikes":24,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1595737358,"LocalDate":"Sun Jul 26 06:22:38 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Milky eyes \n#lockdowndiaries #nikondslr #quarantineandchill #lockdowninspiration #photography2020","NumberOfLikes":9,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Ostrich.nuts.mist on July 25, 2020.

For me, keeping Wellbeing and team morale at the heart of what we do was key. \nAnd hence when i was called out at the South Asia Connect by the HR VP for helping drive Wellbeing and learning during COVID 19 it reinstated my beliefs and I am so excited to have a channel where I can share the power of mental health and yoga to others. \nHere\u2019s to many more achievements both in the field of professionalism as well as self development!

The recent spike in the number of Covid19 positive cases in the capital city has raised quite a lot of alarms for the Government of West Bengal. \nAs the reports stated, as close to 28 areas in Kolkata have been identified as major Covid19 hotspots. Hence, several troops of special police officers troops have been deployed in those areas of concern.

I havent written any poems, done any crafts or written opinion articles. It\u2019s not that I havent tried. I have. But my \u201Ccreative juices\u201D üßÉhave been wrung dry. \n.\nThis #lockdown has given us free time , perhaps too much free time. üïô Time that I otherwise would have been spent studying, at university or out with my friend. Now I had all this free time, it was a little overwhelming.  Having intensely focused on filling the gaps in my days with something creative, it made that time feel more obligatory than inspired. \n.\nSoon enough I realised that I did not have to conquer the world in one day. So I decided to stop trying to cram everything into 24hours and instead take time to focus on me and engage in creative and mind freeing activities when it felt necessary. As my mum says : \u201Ctoo much of anything is never good for you\u201D\n.\nDuring this time I allowed myself to detach from the moment and focus on me. An activity which helped me a lot with this was #yoga üßéüèΩ\u200D‚ôÄÔ∏è ( not the intense flexible yoga, more of the sit on the floor and listen to calming music one ). It helped me to be more mindful and selfaware and it is something I highly recommend to others. Even if it\u2019s just for a few minutes in the morning, trust me it really helps ! \n. \nPS .

I realise we are entering the peak of the pandemic and that our community transmission is not under control. Therefore  closing schools is in line with the  @who guidelines. Still it doesn't sit well with my heart.\n.\nMany of these children have just gotten back into the routine of school and have finally gotten the hang of the new strict COVID procedures and taking them out now has such far reaching consequences. Not just academically but emotionally as well. \nThe fact that it is only public schools is also a little disheartening because for so many school is their safe haven especially now with so many parents back at work.\n.\nThe closures place many children in unsafe child care positions and its not easy for everyone to hire extra help especially when every cent is already accounted for. I feel like this is one of those anti poor policies that did not take into account the demographics of students in public schools.\n.\nI have no answers tonight and it doesn't seem anyone else does. So for tonight I urge you all to say a little prayer for all the children that are about to lose the safety of school for the next 4 weeks.\n.\n.\n.\n#TorensMama #pretoriamom #pretoriablogger #southafricanblogger #lockdowndiaries #schoolclosures","NumberOfLikes":46,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Karen Rivet-Ratshivhombela on July 24, 2020.

She says COVID-19 has presented the biggest challenge of her career.\n\u201CI\u2019ve worked during swine flu and have written flu plans in the past, but nothing prepares you for this. It\u2019s been a continuous learning process. In spite of everything, I believe all the NHS and key workers have done an amazing job. In the NHS we acted on guidance and worked well together in Sussex across the NHS and social care. Lots of people were redeployed to support the response. It showed that NHS and social care staff are really flexible and happy to muck in.\u201D\nKaty is leading on winter planning for NHS Sussex.\n\u201CBuilt into that plan is the possibility of a second peak. We\u2019re modelling different scenarios to make sure we have enough capacity - not just for Covid, but for operations, care homes and nursing homes. The recovery programme must also address backlogs in other areas. It\u2019s a big challenge.\u201D\nKaty has personal as well as professional experience of the pandemic as both her father and her father-in-law died in care homes during lockdown.\n\u201CMy husband\u2019s father died of Covid in Manchester on April 9th. There were no mourners allowed at his funeral. My dad died on April 21st - not of Covid, but I wasn\u2019t able to see him for four weeks. He\u2019d been ill with Parkinsons for a long time. He lived for his family. I got a call a week before he died to say he was very ill. I was told I could go in but that I\u2019d have to wear full PPE and then he would need to be isolated for two weeks, which I didn\u2019t think was fair on him. I told him I loved him on FaceTime the night before he died, but I just felt I could have done better for him. I wanted to hold his hand.\u201D\nKaty, whose parents were together for 52 years, says the whole family is devastated by his loss. But they aren\u2019t angry because that\u2019s not what he would have wanted.\n\u201CMy dad was a true gentleman.

The pre-recorded interviews take place via Zoom and are posted every Tuesday afternoon. You can find them all on the Different Strokes website, Facebook page and YouTube channel - but over the next couple of weeks, a snippet of each already posted to the DS channels are going to be introduced to our wonderful Instagram audience, to give everyone a taster of personal affiliation with each survivor.\u2063\n\u2063\nLockdown interview number four features stroke survivors Sheelagh and Greet. Sheelagh is our Administrator at Different Strokes. She had her stroke in 2018 at the age of 51. Greet works for the NHS and had her stroke just six months ago at the age of 45. Greet spoke to Sheelagh about her misdiagnosis during stroke and her diagnoses after stroke - Wallenberg Syndrome and Central Post Stroke Pain. During lockdown, Greet chats about the difficulties of being disabled with social restrictions, what it\u2019s like having a vibrant little boy in the early chapters of post stroke recovery, missing out on seeing and staying with family in Belgium and replacement exercises she\u2019s been doing to substitute her usual routine. She also talks about the after effects of her stroke, how lucky she felt to be receiving quality aftercare just before the pandemic struck, problems with work, how her stroke will now give her extra empathy being a child physiotherapist in her new job and how the support from Different Strokes has helped her come to terms with her new life.\u2063\n\u2063\nCatch the full interview at:\u2063\nüîó https:\/\/differentstrokes.co.uk\/stroke-survivor-experiences-during-lockdown\/\u2063\n‚ñ∂Ô∏è https:\/\/youtu.be\/nNBMW414umk\u2063\nüëçüèº https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/differentstrokescharity\/\u2063","NumberOfLikes":17,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1595589016,"LocalDate":"Fri Jul 24 13:10:16 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"@aazthasharma \n\n#savage #glam #gladiator #gladiatorheels #black #ootd #ootn #outfitinspo #stairs #indoorphotography #poser #fitgirls #instadaily #instagood #outfitoftheday #quarantine #lockdowndiaries #dressup  #homephotoshoot #kneehigh #shoes #shoelover #shoesaddict #style #styleblogger #blogger #photography #indoor #black #xoxo","NumberOfLikes":3,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by pics on July 24, 2020.

My saree pallu drape has changed with the time so would like to share one memory connected to it in short. Since childhood I have been around beautiful ladies with colorful sarees full time and highly fascinated by them.\n\nWhen I got engaged, I used to drape in 1. Pleated pallu style as I was not fully confident and was too much concern about saree coming out üò¨. \nAfter marriage 2.Head drape was compulsory and as I was not use to it I use to put so many pins on head to set the pallu.\nDuring pregnancy I use to prefer 3. Wrapped around shoulder drape to cover my tummy ( use to feel shyüòú).When kids were small half of the time my saree pallu was 4.  tucked in petticoat for free movement.\n Later when kids grew up was little free from taking them in Lap so started with 5. Flowing drape. \nToday when girls grew up , I take help of my girls in styling my sarees and selection of  blouse and accessories. Now I am 100% confident and I love to wear and carry myself  in different styles. Being a saree lover,I love to try and  take  saree styling  to newer, trendier heights.\nYou may not realize, but the modest pallu has the power to make or break your saree look from traditional to uber chic by varying pallu drapes. I remember sometimes I use to do certain changes while tieing  and carrying  saree and pallu to look slimmer,  taller, sometimes to add an illusion of weight.üôà\n\n‚ùìLadies Which one is your fav pallu drape ???\nAnd gentlemens which drape you like the most???\n123\n456\n\nDo share your pallu drape storiesüëç\n#smilemore #photooftheday‚ù§Ô∏è #styleblogger #style \n#lockdowndiaries #loveforsarees‚ù§Ô∏è\n#motivationalquotes #chennaiinfluencer #chennaimommyblogger  #spiritualawakening #instamom #mommybloggers #mombloggersofindia  #fashionlover #fashionbloggerindia #igram #explorepage #stylegram #lookoftheday  #affordablefashion  #styleblogger  #pictoftheday  #fashionlover #fashionbloggerindia #igram #stylegram #iconiclook #personalstyle #ss07insta # brands2bloggers","NumberOfLikes":146,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Meraki on July 24, 2020.

Taking a simple progression & a simple thought ahead \" I'll be there you \" was born.. Little did I expect the feedback that was to follow and now that Songdew came forward to take it up for a digital platforms release, it is one of the most fulfilling moments to have my first effort in production reach this far.. \n\nAcknowledging the importance of the moment, I did get the song re-mastered at @graysparkaudio so that it's fit for release on #streamingplatforms so thanks to @ronakrunwal for giving it the finishing touch. \n\nSorry for the long post..
