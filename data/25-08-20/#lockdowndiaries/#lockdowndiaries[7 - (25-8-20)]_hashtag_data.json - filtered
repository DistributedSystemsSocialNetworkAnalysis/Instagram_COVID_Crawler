But when it comes to Palak Paneer, I think we would definitely make an exception. It's one of the easiest recipes to experiment with, when it comes to Paneer dishes. And the beautiful blend of colours are so pleasant to look at, which for us, adds further to the beauty of this dish. You need only a few things, which are easily available in any grocery store. One of the key ingredients of this recipe is  ofc Palak and for us, it's one of the most deceitful way through which you could make a non Palak lover, fall in love with Palak. \n\n#paneer #paneerrecipes #palakpaneer #palak #foodaddict #foodbloggers #cleaneating #lockdowndiaries #lockdowncooking #chefmodeon #instayum #igeats #yummy #happytummy #goodvibes #foodphotography #foodventures #foodstagram #foodtherapy #foodforthought #foodcoma #foodforfoodies #foodiesofinstagram#eatfamous #eatstagram #instagood #instafood #instafoodgram#homemadefood #homecooking","NumberOfLikes":46,"Hashtags":["#paneer","#paneerrecipes","#palakpaneer","#palak","#foodaddict","#foodbloggers","#cleaneating","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdowncooking","#chefmodeon","#instayum","#igeats","#yummy","#happytummy","#goodvibes","#foodphotography","#foodventures","#foodstagram","#foodtherapy","#foodforthought","#foodcoma","#foodforfoodies","#foodiesofinstagra","#eatfamous","#eatstagram","#instagood","#instafood","#instafoodgra","#homemadefood","#homecooking"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by @__thecarbdashians__ on July 23, 2020 tagging @tanuka_b.

If you want to experience Cuba in Miami, then Little Havana is the place to go. When we bicycled our way to Little Havana, we had a different notion about the area, It could be because we lived in South Beach, we had different expectations. Little Havana is authentic!!!...colorful streets, family-run Cuban-owned businesses, traditional cuban food, thriving art scene, salsa music out loud and a hotbed of Hispanic culture\/lifestyle\/nuances. Did you know Cubans have this weird New Year eve tradition-Eating 12 grapes at midnight. New Year\u2019s Eve in Cuba involves 12 grapes and the stroke of midnight. When the countdown ends each grape is eaten, one after the other, to represent the 12 months of the New Year. With each grape, there is a wish made. When all the 12 grapes are eaten, the fruity midnight feast is wrapped up with a glass of sidra (a Spanish cider that\u2019s fermented without any added sweeteners). And the interesting part is Cubans do all this before the clock reaches 00:01am otherwise it is consider as bad luck for the rest of the year!!!\n..\n.\n.\n#MiamiBeach #MiamiBeachLife #MiamiBeachFlorida\n#MiamiArt #Summervibes #MiamiLife #LittleHavana #LittleHavanaMiami #CubanComida #culturetrips #streetphotoshoot #streetart #cubanosenmiami\n #MiamiTourism  #exploreMiami #exploremore\n #lockdowndiaries #exploreFlorida #urbanphotography #miamistreets\n #MiamisFinest\n #funinthesun\n#travelstories\n#worldcaptures #nakedplanet \n#TravelWideLiveDeep\n#endlessdiscovery\n#googlepixel3xl  #traveldiaries2020 \n#DetourDiaries","NumberOfLikes":34,"Hashtags":["#MiamiBeach","#MiamiBeachLife","#MiamiBeachFlorida","#MiamiArt","#Summervibes","#MiamiLife","#LittleHavana","#LittleHavanaMiami","#CubanComida","#culturetrips","#streetphotoshoot","#streetart","#cubanosenmiami","#MiamiTourism","#exploreMiami","#exploremore","#lockdowndiaries","#exploreFlorida","#urbanphotography","#miamistreets","#MiamisFinest","#funinthesun","#travelstories","#worldcaptures","#nakedplanet","#TravelWideLiveDeep","#endlessdiscovery","#googlepixel3xl","#traveldiaries2020","#DetourDiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1595559495,"LocalDate":"Fri Jul 24 04:58:15 CEST 2020","Location":"Little Havana"},{"Owner":"sanskriti.bluesparrowscience","CaptionText":"When my mornings are full of these fuzzy cloud feelings ! üíûCouldnt have been more greatful for this stolen year with her.

I have ignored myself mentally, phisically, emotionally. Most of the time I realised that I never got what I deserved or I craved or prayed for! But in this Covid 19 pandamic period.. Time has taught me a lot and gave me a little break from all the 'life' that I was leading. I focused on myself. Yes. I was on the verge of turning into obesity. Before lockdown In March I was 83 kgs and after 4 months of hardwork I have reduced 15 kgs. My weight is 68 KG now.\nThis was a tremendous journey for me. Home food, healthy diet, Yoga,running , a bit excercise and mediation-  These were the things which helped me to go on. Now when I look back I feel happy, light and relax. All I want to say is - focus on your needs and ignore the negativity around. Experience and excersize these are the best teachers!\n.\n.\n.\n#covid19 #lockdowndiaries #lockdown #lockdownismythingnow #lockdowntransformation #healthylifestyle #healthyfood #metime #excersise #transformation #radio #radiopeople #radiocity #benny #maharashtra #kolhapur #pune #puneri #slowlife #meaning #jiyoorjinedo #weightlossjourney2020 #weightloss #journey #heal #healthyliving #meditation #pandamic2020 #2020rocks #2020vision","NumberOfLikes":96,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdown","#lockdownismythingnow","#lockdowntransformation","#healthylifestyle","#healthyfood","#metime","#excersise","#transformation","#radio","#radiopeople","#radiocity","#benny","#maharashtra","#kolhapur","#pune","#puneri","#slowlife","#meaning","#jiyoorjinedo","#weightlossjourney2020","#weightloss","#journey","#heal","#healthyliving","#meditation","#pandamic2020","#2020rocks","#2020vision"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Kedar Benade on July 23, 2020.

You can find them all on the Different Strokes website, Facebook page and YouTube channel - but over the next couple of weeks, a snippet of each already posted to the DS channels are going to be introduced to our wonderful Instagram audience, to give everyone a taster of personal affiliation with each survivor.\u2063\n\u2063\nLockdown interview number three features stroke survivors Sheelagh and Andy. Sheelagh is our Administrator at Different Strokes. She had her stroke in 2018 at the age of 51. Andy is a police officer and he had his stroke in 2019 at the age of 46. Andy spoke to Sheelagh about his life before and after stroke and the challenges he\u2019s faced along the way. He also chats about his change of routine during lockdown; having his children homeschooling, the activities and sensory exposure he\u2019s missing, the exercise necessary for his stabilising recovery having to stop and how he\u2019s built his own space at home, and the tips and strategies he has on how to read efficiently with a post stroke brain.\u2063\n\u2063\n Catch the full interview at:\u2063\nüîó https:\/\/differentstrokes.co.uk\/stroke-survivor-experiences-during-lockdown\/\u2063\n‚ñ∂Ô∏è https:\/\/youtu.be\/nNBMW414umk\u2063\nüëçüèº https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/differentstrokescharity\/\u2063","NumberOfLikes":17,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1595502807,"LocalDate":"Thu Jul 23 13:13:27 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"under_a_happy_haze","CaptionText":"I\u2019m safe at home üè° üç∑ üåø","NumberOfLikes":71,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Kayleigh | üåª | She\/Her | ü¶ä on July 23, 2020.

I would show up even if I was having a bad day. I listened carefully. I did all the assignments as though the instructor, like my piano teacher back in the day, had a stick with which to hit me for not doing as told.\n\nThus, well, upon receiving this piece of paper, I jumped for joy! I paid for this class, though it is only one of five specializations, which means I should expect four more certificates from this course alone.\n\nNow I'm thinking of going back to the courses I've completed but only audited -- European Paintings (1400s-1900s) at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Contemporary Art at MoMA, and Poetry at California Institute of the Arts -- and pay for them so I can claim my certificates.\n\n#onlineschooling\n#newnorms\n#creativewriting \n#latebloomer \n#quarantinejournal\n#lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":45,"Hashtags":["#onlineschooling","#newnorms","#creativewriting","#latebloomer","#quarantinejournal","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by AA Patawaran in Manila, Philippines.","NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1595478311,"LocalDate":"Thu Jul 23 06:25:11 CEST 2020","Location":"Manila, Philippines"},{"Owner":"the_tale_of_crazy_engineer","CaptionText":"A good quality cashew nut tea cake can made your lockdown day awesome \n#happycooking #lockdowndiaries #goodmorning","NumberOfLikes":25,"Hashtags":["#happycooking","#lockdowndiaries","#goodmorning"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1595475627,"LocalDate":"Thu Jul 23 05:40:27 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"designerrups","CaptionText":"#litlotapp #roposo #roposostar #roposolove #mojito #cuteart #heartbeat #litlotshot #clickmarathi #litlotappüáÆüá≥ #roposotalks #cuteedits #rups #rups3 #takatak #takataka #timepasshub #lockdown2020 #lockdownlifestories #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":351,"Hashtags":["#litlotapp","#roposo","#roposostar","#roposolove","#mojito","#cuteart","#heartbeat","#litlotshot","#clickmarathi","#litlotappüáÆüá≥","#roposotalks","#cuteedits","#rups","#rups3","#takatak","#takataka","#timepasshub","#lockdown2020","#lockdownlifestories","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":9,"Timestamp":1595475531,"LocalDate":"Thu Jul 23 05:38:51 CEST 2020","Location":"Pune, Maharashtra"},{"Owner":"bollywoodjasos","CaptionText":"#Repost @amyradastur93 (@get_repost)\n„Éª„Éª„Éª\n\u201CKeep your eyes on the stars and your feet on the ground.\u201D - #theodoreroosevelt üåü\n.\n.\nüì∏ @diasphotographydiary \n.\n.\n.\n#blackandwhitephotography #homephotoshoot #reachforthestars #lockdown2020 #lockdowndiaries #photoshoot #photooftheday","NumberOfLikes":3,"Hashtags":["#Repost","#theodoreroosevelt","#blackandwhitephotography","#homephotoshoot","#reachforthestars","#lockdown2020","#lockdowndiaries","#photoshoot","#photooftheday"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by justice for sushantsinghrajput on July 22, 2020.

And it has been nice! But it's also involved things like visiting shops I've not been to for months and seeing them full of cordons and plastic shields; seeing the difference for the first time is always more difficult than watching things gradually change. Things like being surrounded by families in the park who are trying to pretend that they're having fun. They were looking forward to having fun, their eyes all say. They don't know what to do now it's miserable here as well.\n\nI know a lot of people have found this time hard, much harder than they thought they would. And they don't know how to say it's been hard because it wasn't supposed to be hard, and being unhappy is always harder when you're somewhere that's meant to be nice. At times like this I often think I need to tell myself a new story that can cope with how messy my actual life and feelings are. I'm not sure I've thought of one quite yet. But I think it's important to admit that I'm trying to find one, rather than to pretend the one I had is working especially well.\n\n#depression #lockdowndiaries #pessimism #depressiondrawing #pandemicart #depressionart #depressionposts","NumberOfLikes":22,"Hashtags":["#depression","#lockdowndiaries","#pessimism","#depressiondrawing","#pandemicart","#depressionart","#depressionposts"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Robert Shepherd in Edinburgh, United Kingdom.

During the early days of quarantine, a time when most people in our neighborhood were still very much scared to go out, a husband and wife tandem started selling food here in our place, which they sell thru the Facebook Messenger group chat created specifically to let homeowners sell their goods.\n‚ñ™Ô∏è\nOne of the many dishes I bought from them was this tub of Pansit Palabok, for only 60 pesos (a little over 1usd). It was a different kind of Pansit Palabok - it wasn\u2019t saucy at all, but cooked a la Pansit Bihon Guisado - but it sure tasted great. \n‚ñ™Ô∏è\nUnfortunately, when the quarantine got a little flexible and people started going out (we still don\u2019t have public transportation in the area), they started losing customers and when the husband returned to work, the wife had a difficulty cooking and delivering goods by herself, that they stopped selling.\n‚ñ™Ô∏è\nI hope they\u2019d return, even during weekends. Every food I bought from them tasted good, never had any complaints, and their business grew significantly in that short amount of time. At first they didn\u2019t care much about presentation until one person expressed her dismay, which made them change their whole way of doing the business. Sure there are some food sellers that are still thriving, and some new players entered the game offering more choices, but I miss eating their food.\n‚ñ™Ô∏è\nAs for me, it did come across my mind to sell food, too... but I am alone. Just doing everything all by myself - going to the market, preparing, cooking, packing, delivering... all using my two legs and hands (as we don\u2019t have any vehicle), plus answering to inquires, seemed a little too much for me to bear. If my mom and sister were here, we\u2019d push for it. \n______________\n#pansitpalabok #pancitpalabok #pansit #pancit #lockdowndiaries #fooddelivery #food #foodphotography #foodstagram #foodstagramph #filipinofood #filipinocuisine #lutongpinoy #lutongbahay #foodtrip #seemslegeat #eatpilipinas #kainpilipinas #pagkaingpinoy #kainpinoy #foodinspiration","NumberOfLikes":45,"Hashtags":["#pansitpalabok","#pancitpalabok","#pansit","#pancit","#lockdowndiaries","#fooddelivery","#food","#foodphotography","#foodstagram","#foodstagramph","#filipinofood","#filipinocuisine","#lutongpinoy","#lutongbahay","#foodtrip","#seemslegeat","#eatpilipinas","#kainpilipinas","#pagkaingpinoy","#kainpinoy","#foodinspiration"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Jenny Jayne in Caloocan.

Usually HR would insist but today we let it slide. Every office has that scruffy looking employee. \n- There were no time for breakfast today and everyone were left to fend for themselves, except the committee of little people who are always waited on hand and foot. \n- A lot of chores were completed today including 5 loads of laundry. The down side of buying winter wardrobes is unfortunately an instant overflow of laudry. \n- HR added a new word to the dictionary today; De-COVID-ed ~ Verb ~ When an item has been left in the garage long enough for the virus to have died and you may now bring it inside. \n- The office manual dishwasher is happy to report that the office electric dishwasher will be back on Monday. It was only a small pipe that came loose, nothing is damaged and they are charging us R1,000 to stick a pipe bag where it belongs. Joyous \n- We are rejoiced that ecommerce has re-opened and we celebrated by buying some non-essentials like toys for bribes, books, and HR ordered herself a mothersday cup...with boobies, very classy boobies. I will post a photo when I receive it, the cup that is. Pieter ordered himself TWO books on how to be a more productive worker, the only thing that will now change is that he will be working while he sleeps, because that's the only level up from where he currently operates. \n- We learned today that Kevin has been spelling our address wrong for the past couple of years, it's a miracle the packages reached us. This Kevin, ugh. \n- Co-worker Marli decided to decorate Nina's brand new onesie with khokis...the joys of parenting.

It\u2019s what makes us human.‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nIf you\u2019re struggling or maybe just looking for more ways to practice self-care, here are some tips to keep in mind to practice more gratitude during the pandemic:‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nùüè. ùêÉùêéùêç\u2019ùêì ùêÖùêéùêëùêÇùêÑ ùêòùêéùêîùêëùêíùêÑùêãùêÖ‚†Ä\nIf you are having a hard time feeling grateful right now, know that it\u2019s ok. It is perfectly fine to give yourself the time to process your emotions however you need to process them and at your own pace. Unconditional self-acceptance is more important than ever. It allows us to accept others too. We are quick to negatively judge ourselves and others when our survival feels threatened.

For someone that finds so much happiness in making women look and feel beautiful, I realized I didn\u2019t even feel my best. I was always that girl that wore baggy clothing to cover up my body. It was my comfort blanket, it covered my insecurities and it worked for a bit. I used to LOVE wearing sarees, it was one of my favourite attires, BUT that changed. All of last year, wearing a saree to weddings (including my own wedding) was honestly one of the scariest things for me. I felt BEYOND insecure. \n\nThankfully, that feeling started to change recently. A couple months ago, I decided I\u2019ll make the change for myself and started intermittent fasting AND a vegetarian ketogenic diet (which is much harder than a regular ketogenic diet). I consume less carbs and barely no sugar. I have been very strict, except when my sister in law bakes cupcakes (only time it\u2019s worth it) üòä\n\nWhen I started the diet, I was my heaviest. Now, I can proudly say I\u2019ve lost 25 lbs in the last couple months and  I\u2019m a size and a half down ü§≠ a lot more work to go but the goal is to lose another 25 and then start incorporating carbs back into my diet. Point is, do whatever it takes to keep your mental heath stable. My whole life, I\u2019ve let all the negative comments from those RUDE ASS AUNTIES\/UNCLES let me believe I was fat or ugly. Little did I know, I was always the size I wanted to be. I just didn\u2019t know. You get to choose what keeps you happy. I don\u2019t know how others feel, but this lockdown changed my view of EVERYTHING. \n.\n.\n.\nTOP: @tiabhuva \n.\n.\n.\n#aboutme #lockdowndiaries #weightloss #ketoweightloss","NumberOfLikes":404,"Hashtags":["#aboutme","#lockdowndiaries","#weightloss","#ketoweightloss"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by H A I R.

Jo is the secretary. She also acts as a lead coordinator for the group. She was employed as a registrar and had her stroke in July 2014, aged 45. Jo\u2019s stroke was a clot. Andy is chairman of Different Strokes Southampton. He also acts as a lead contact as well as coordinator for the group. Andy is employed as a horticulturalist and had his stroke in August 2009, aged 40 years. Andy\u2019s stroke was also a clot. \u2063\n\u2063\nKickstarting the lockdown interviews, Andy spoke to Jo about being segregated from his parents, typical routines being disturbed, and how much he\u2019s missing the in person stroke group whilst adapting to this new chapter of life.

That\u2019s why I never miss a chance to take a detour whenever on a road trip. There\u2019s something extraordinary about Indian dhabas across highways.  Whether it be the use of firewood for  cooking, the giant pans with steaming hot tea, the earthy smell of lassi and chai kulhad, the inhouse preparations of scrumptious spices, the fresh harvest from their backyard farms, their mouth watering pickles, the welcoming aroma of Indian hospitality.  Everything about a dhaba brings that smile on our lips when we eat home cooked food.  There\u2019s nothing like having hot maggie in grey and damp weather in a bamboo constructed dhaba set against a rugged terrain.  But this picture is from a recent trip to Gujarat just before lockdown. These besan savouries were made locally at dhaba owner\u2019s place.

Finally Stepped out of my house after almost 3 months. First Stop:- M.A.C.! @maccosmeticsindia My Shopoholic soul needed some retail therapy. Bought 2 Lipsticks\/ Liquid Lip Colours from Their Newly Launched Powder KISS Liquid Lipstick Formulas. Wearing \u2018Mull It Over\u2019.. A Gorgeous Peachy Nude. \n\nLadies Point To Note:- While the colours are gorgeous, and the formula is light weight & butter smooth.. it is not transfer proof. Nor is it long wear. It moves on the lips when you rub them together. If you\u2019re looking for longevity & kiss proof qualities then give it a pass. You will need to reapply this one. Try their powder kiss matte lipstick instead. They are more resilient than the liquid variation. I have no qualms with the above cons so I\u2019m pro this formulation. Although, on the plus side, it does leave a soft focus blurred tint even after the main colour fades out. I\u2019ve experimented blending this one with M.A.C\u2019s other matte formulas &  have noticed that it does increase the staying power of the colour. \n\nBasically have tried all tips and tricks to check its versatility. It is on the expensive side. Due to the current COVID scenario, you cannot try it on in the stores. So if you\u2019re unsure how this formulation will look on your complexions, then I suggest you wait. (Speaking From Personal Experience:- Bought The Classic Matte Lipstick in \u2018Yash\u2019 online. A gorgeous nude that completely washed out my complexion. It looks lovely on Indian skin tones though. Mine unfortunately is extremely fair with a prominent pink undertone so it didn\u2019t suit me).

William Schaffner, MD, Professor of preventive medicine & infectious disease, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, US said, \"We want to protect you from me.

Her presence and personality are bold and commanding, rhythms of upbeat music are her forte. When it comes to transparency with her fans, she is not afraid at all. Rexha has been suffering from bipolar disorder. Earlier she was fearful, she didn't want to consider her illness at all, but finally she worked up the courage to face her fears. Rexha first revealed her battle with bipolar disorder last April to her 1.6 million followers on Twitter.\n.\nShe wrote, \u201CFor the longest time, I didn\u2019t understand why I felt so sick. Why I felt lows that made me not want to leave my house or be around people and why I felt highs that wouldn\u2019t let me sleep, wouldn\u2019t let me stop working or creating music. Now I know why.\u201D Rexha said that throughout her life, she had experienced symptoms like mood swings, anxiousness and overwhelming depression.\n.\nAnd in the midst of it all, she was also diagnosed with premenstrual dysphoric disorder, a condition that occurs a week or two before a woman\u2019s menstrual cycle, which can cause severe irritability, depression, or anxiety. It wasn't easy confronting her illness, but the singer, along with the support of her friends and family, managed to get the right treatment and medication.\n_\nVisit us at www.cowin.live\n_\n\n#cowin #global #covid19 #who #pandemic #lockdown #globalpandemic #coronavirus #HealthForAll  #stayhome #staysafe #socialdistancing #safetymeasures #awareness #lockdowndiaries #quatantine #homebound #unitednations #technology #tech #TechnologyForGood #techstartup #techsolution #instatech #appdesign #healthcare #quarintinelife #canada #globaleconomy #indianeconomy","NumberOfLikes":10,"Hashtags":["#cowin","#global","#covid19","#who","#pandemic","#lockdown","#globalpandemic","#coronavirus","#HealthForAll","#stayhome","#staysafe","#socialdistancing","#safetymeasures","#awareness","#lockdowndiaries","#quatantine","#homebound","#unitednations","#technology","#tech","#TechnologyForGood","#techstartup","#techsolution","#instatech","#appdesign","#healthcare","#quarintinelife","#canada","#globaleconomy","#indianeconomy"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Collective Win on July 20, 2020.

Full sleeves tee-shirt and track pants and cotton socks.‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\n‚úÖ Carry a large breathable scarf to cover him as he is under 2 years and masks are not recommended upto 2 years. I chose a semi-transparent colorful scarf so that when I put it on his face, he doesn't resist it.‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\n‚úÖ Carry an extra sheet to spread it on doctor's examination table and carrying a separate bag to store it once done.‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\n‚úÖ Make sure his diaper bag is fully equipped for any emergency - extra diapers, extra pair of clothes, wet - wipes, water , snacks etc.‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\n‚úÖ While travelling in car, making sure that he did not touch the outside surface.‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\n‚úÖ Avoid touching common surfaces like door knobs, lift buttons etc. while entering or exiting the clinic or hospital.‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\n‚úÖ Wait outside the clinic or a less crowded space in hospital till it is our turn to visit the doctor.‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\n‚úÖ  Using hand santizer immediately after touching any surface and avoid touching his eyes, mouth or nose.‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\n‚úÖ Giving him a bath and taking a bath ourselves immediately after we returned.‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nüëâ Remember DO NOT use excessive hand sanitizer for yourself or the toddlers.

Anxiety is common with the possibility of getting affected, but what\u2019s more for people at home is the frustration that is building up into their minds, slowly. Anger, agitation, frustration, and all other related forms can be seen on a rise. Be it the disappointed fury that appears when you see someone evidently breaking the lockdown rules, or the worried frustration when people don\u2019t adhere to the social distancing rules in the outside world \u2013 anger is everywhere. There\u2019s also angry sadness over the uncertainty of our futures \u2013 and our present. According to Dr Donna Grant, Consultant Psychiatrist at Priory Hospital Chelmsford, the reason we might be feeling more tetchy than normal could be to do with the sense of loss we\u2019re feeling at the moment. She explained, \u201CPeople may be experiencing a loss of routine, a loss of contact with friends, work colleagues and family, as well as a loss of loved ones through bereavement \u2013 all of which can make us feel more irritable and angry.\u201D The only way to tackle this is to invest it into something productive, to turn the chaos into kindness.\n_\nVisit us at www.cowin.live\n_\n\n#cowin #global #covid19 #who #pandemic #lockdown #globalpandemic #coronavirus #HealthForAll #stayhome #staysafe #socialdistancing #safetymeasures #awareness #lockdowndiaries #quatantine #homebound #unitednations #technology #tech #TechnologyForGood #techstartup #techsolution #instatech #appdesign #healthcare #quarintinelife #canada #globaleconomy #indianeconomy","NumberOfLikes":11,"Hashtags":["#cowin","#global","#covid19","#who","#pandemic","#lockdown","#globalpandemic","#coronavirus","#HealthForAll","#stayhome","#staysafe","#socialdistancing","#safetymeasures","#awareness","#lockdowndiaries","#quatantine","#homebound","#unitednations","#technology","#tech","#TechnologyForGood","#techstartup","#techsolution","#instatech","#appdesign","#healthcare","#quarintinelife","#canada","#globaleconomy","#indianeconomy"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Collective Win on July 19, 2020.
