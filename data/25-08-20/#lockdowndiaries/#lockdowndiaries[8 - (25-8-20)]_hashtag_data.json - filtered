Also, I\u2019ve been re-reading The Diary of Anne Frank.  That is truly a remarkable book and amazing gift to have come down to us from that horrible time in history.  I read it when I was young, but I think I appreciate it much more now that I\u2019m probably closer to the age Anne\u2019s parents were in the book. \n\nBelow is one of my favorite quotes that seems to jump through the pages and speak to our time.  It\u2019s in a section (Tues, March 7th, 1944) where Anne is talking about how she and her mother differ in how they try mentally to get through hardship. \n\nShe says of her mom: \u201CHer counsel when one feels melancholy is: \u2018Think of all the misery in the world and be glad that you are not sharing in it.\u2019\u201D And then Anne goes on: \u201CMy advice is: \u2018Go outside, to the fields, enjoy nature and the sunshine, go out and try to recapture happiness in yourself and in God.  Think of all the beauty that\u2019s still left in and around you and be happy!\u2019\u201D\n\nWise words and even more poignant that they were written when Anne was almost 15 and that she didn\u2019t live to 16.  But a miracle in a way that we have her words at all.\n\nI was struck too by this passage (in Tues, April 4th, 1944):\n\n\u201CI want to go on living even after my death!  And therefore I am grateful to God for giving me this gift, this possibility of developing myself and of writing, of expressing all that is in me.  I can shake off everything if I write; my sorrows disappear, my courage is reborn.\u201D\n\nHow wonderful that, even amidst the tragedy of her young death, her wish came true!\n.\n.\n.\n.#teddybear #teddybearlove #teddybearlovers #patchwork #patchworklovers #journalingcommunity #quranjournaling #journaling #quarantinelife #lockdownlife #lockdowndiaries #lockdownart #sendinglove #carepackage #carepackages #stationeryshop #stationerylove #bagsoflove #contradouk","NumberOfLikes":66,"Hashtags":["#teddybear","#teddybearlove","#teddybearlovers","#patchwork","#patchworklovers","#journalingcommunity","#quranjournaling","#journaling","#quarantinelife","#lockdownlife","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdownart","#sendinglove","#carepackage","#carepackages","#stationeryshop","#stationerylove","#bagsoflove","#contradouk"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1595160958,"LocalDate":"Sun Jul 19 14:15:58 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"vidhya_msnair","CaptionText":"Peace making...\n\nIf you have lots of time,colours,brushes nd a piece of paper.....\n\nMake use of it ... every single time you will be happy just becoz you love to do it...\n\nEnjoy what you are doing..🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️👩\u200D🎨 \n\n#best_out_of_waste  #acrylpainting #wallwatch #artistsoninstagram #boredomatitsfinest #lockdowndiaries #2020 #art #artist #timelapse #moonlight","NumberOfLikes":37,"Hashtags":["#best_out_of_waste","#acrylpainting","#wallwatch","#artistsoninstagram","#boredomatitsfinest","#lockdowndiaries","#2020","#art","#artist","#timelapse","#moonlight"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by vidhya_msnair on July 19, 2020.","NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1595160773,"LocalDate":"Sun Jul 19 14:12:53 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"pakhipoddar25","CaptionText":"M to jaungi👻👻#throwback #selflove #selfobsessed #swarg #school #lockdown #quarantine #lockdowndiaries #lockdowlife #boredinthehouse #bored","NumberOfLikes":39,"Hashtags":["#throwback","#selflove","#selfobsessed","#swarg","#school","#lockdown","#quarantine","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdowlife","#boredinthehouse","#bored"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1595160718,"LocalDate":"Sun Jul 19 14:11:58 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"leslindsz","CaptionText":"Hot hot banana bun\n #buns #mangalore #surathkal #mangalorefoodie #mangalorebuns #southindianfood #foodie #foodphotography #foodlove #foodiegram #foodieofinstagram #instafoodie #photography #cooking #coronacooking #lockdowndiaries #homecooking #athomechef #homechef #homekitchen #chefwannabe #amateurchef @foodnetwork @foodiesfeature @cooking.shooking @_indian_food_lovers_","NumberOfLikes":9,"Hashtags":["#buns","#mangalore","#surathkal","#mangalorefoodie","#mangalorebuns","#southindianfood","#foodie","#foodphotography","#foodlove","#foodiegram","#foodieofinstagram","#instafoodie","#photography","#cooking","#coronacooking","#lockdowndiaries","#homecooking","#athomechef","#homechef","#homekitchen","#chefwannabe","#amateurchef"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Leslin Sushma Dsouza on July 19, 2020.

Distance makes a difference \n- I was lucky enough to still be able to teach Pilates. Even better, I met lots of lovely new clients from all over the world. Being able to reach out to so many people has been fantastic and humbling. \n- My friends have been able to join my classes. Seeing familiar names\/faces has been heart warming. Hearing nice words even better.\n- Spending time and lots of it with my kids was actually the nicest part. (Now I need to go to a retreat)\n- I hate home schooling \n- Baking can be fun. Banana bread is the best\n- I cooked things that even surprised myself ! \n- I learned how to do a facial massage\n- I was able to join some amazing workshops by awesome international teachers. I also enjoyed classes with @itsnikibird \n- I realised Netflix is a staple in our lives\n- I studied but not as much as I needed to\n- I read books but not as much as I would like to\n- I used up all my cosmetics, almost none of my make up\n- Got used to having my nails without manicure\/nail polish \n- I did face masks, lots of them \n- First I didn\u2019t shop at all, I was in no mood for that. Then it all started again! \n- I missed actual yoga classes. A real class in the same room is priceless\n- I got an indoors bike\n- I ran more \n- I discovered my surroundings locally\n- Hampstead Heath became my sanctuary \n- I noticed all the beautiful flowers and plants around me \n- I resolved lots of arguments over toys \n- I spoke to some of my friends more often or to some that I haven\u2019t spoken to for a while\n- Also realised some people never even ask how you are \n- You learn that most likely the weather will be incredibly hot when you have to stay at home \n- Screen time has unfortunately increased massively \n- You can use the extra time at home to do all the things you ever wanted to do and never got to.

Once lockdown imposed I was getting frustrated due to negative news all over media and the cases which were increasing, and then suddenly I realised why not invest my spare time in Gardening. Beleive me, gardening worked as a #meditation to me. You used to get your me time, and while gardening you can think about the different aspects of life, imagine and plan your upcoming life. It calms you down and bring positivity. \n\nAlso if you are helping your surrounding, then I think it is also good for your family too. I started with 2 plants. Now I have around 24. In which 8 are indoor plants and rest are outdoor. If someone asked what you have achieved by doing this in a rented house, then I'll say peace of mind and a hope of greener future. 🌿🍀🌲💚\n\n#greenery #peace #meditation #gardening #mentalhealth  #positivevibes","NumberOfLikes":41,"Hashtags":["#lockdowndiaries","#meditation","#greenery","#peace","#meditation","#gardening","#mentalhealth","#positivevibes"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by SWAPNIL SRIVASTAVA on July 19, 2020.

In fact, a lack of vitamin C can even make you more prone to getting sick.

The preference for handcrafted finishes sets a particular rhythm at the construction site; earth is pressed into bricks and rammed into walls, solid timber truss beams are assembled in situ with a minimal set of tools.

Although, truth be told, we haven\u2019t done any formal learning at all since the schools closed in March.  This was a conscious decision. \n\nIn March my children were 6 and a half (in year 2), 4 and a half (doing 2 days a week at nursery) and 6 months.  My husband works full time and I am on maternity leave.  Practically, with that age combination, it would have been very difficult and stressful to attempt much sit down style learning.  But more than that, I believe children in England start school too young, that school is too formal and adult led too quickly, and that the year 2 SATS are a terrible idea.  We embraced the opportunity to prioritise the things we think are important in childhood.  Our home education has consisted of walking, reading, watching films and free play. \n\nMy children have gone through real waves of emotion.  Much of the early months was really positive.  My husband\u2019s work took a long time to sort out remote access so we were able to spend a lot of time together.  We were bereaved twice in these first weeks of the pandemic and so sad not to see my parents particularly as my dad is very poorly.  The time together enabled us to support the children and deeply explore our family philosophy and values.\n\nRecent weeks have been harder.  The 6 year old is missing some of the freedom and independence he had, and the 4 year old misses the opportunity to play without being dictated to by his brother.  I fell down a rabbit hole of anxiety although with the help of medication, the perinatal mental health team and family support I have pulled myself out.  Some people have asked whether we will be sending the boys back to school and the answer is yes.  The 6 year old really misses his school friends and the 4 year old is desperate to start school.  It\u2019s a rite of passage that we have talked about so much over the years and now is not the time to take that away from him.  I want to go back to work and give my left brain some of the action.  But I am nervous about what school in a pandemic will look like (continued in comments)...","NumberOfLikes":22,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Tessa 💚 she\/her on July 18, 2020.

In our individual lives and across the world. \n\nSome of us with privilege are finally waking up to it. Tentatively, but still, so.\n\nSome of us face our demons during lockdown - whether that\u2019s too much time with ourselves, our families or a resetting of identity as we grieve what is lost.\n\nSome of us had to focus on just waking up each day and continuing.\n\nLook at us, in all our ugliness and our beauty. How many of us, despite being afraid, reach for the opportunity to grow. Like plants leaning into sunshine. Like caterpillars into butterflies 🦋 \n\nIn all the chaos there can be pockets of growth and change, little sprouts of hope. Clarity and balance so we can make conscious change.\n\nWhere have you grown? What\u2019s different about you since this all began? I\u2019d love to know. I\u2019m much more committed to rituals of self-care than ever. It took a while to choose this path, but I love it now.\n\nIf you need more mental balance in the chaos, join me online with @tringyogastudio on Sunday (tomorrow) 7pm UK time for a FREE meditation - we will practice kirtan kriya for that clarity so you can take conscious choices in the whirlwind of the world today.

Be it real Chinese or Indo Chinese I have always loved this soup for that sweetness of corn and the crunch of veggies. \n\nThis bowl of comfort is made with minimum of ingredients yet the outcome is just delicious. This is a very easy recipe if you don't want spend a lot of time in the kitchen and perfect for this season.\n\nIngredients:\nMakes 4-5 bowls\n1 1\/2 cup Corn kernels\n3\/4 corn kernels' paste\n2 small carrots cut into small pieces\nHandful of french beans cut into small pieces\n1 inch of ginger chopped\n4 cups broth or normal water\n1 tbsp butter\n3-4 tbsp Corn flour\nCut green chilies in vinegar\nHerbed butter (optional)\nI add chopped coriander, chili and pepper to the softened butter.\nSalt and pepper\n\nIn a deep non-stick pan; heat the butter, add the ginger. Saute for a minute or two then add the veggies (carrots, beans and corn)\nSaute for 2-3 mins. Cover with the lid for 2-3 mins. Add the corn paste, 1\/2 cup water, season with salt and cover again stirring in between.\nOnce the veggies are cooked (I don't cook them completely as I like the crunch) add the broth. Season with salt and pepper.\nAdd the corn flour paste and simmer it for 5 mins stirring occasionally. Adjust the water and corn flour as per the consistency you prefer. Serve hot with chili vinegar and herbed butter.\n\nThis is my official contribution for the contest #letscornit hosted and sponsered by @cooking_day_diaries\n@asthas_kitchen @viniscookbook @healthychoices_in @wahhindia and @incredible.kitchen \n\nFurther tagging- @___.irasfoodblog.___  @caffe_nene \n@one.tsp.love\n\nThanks @coriander_n_me for tagging!\n.\n.\n#letscornit #sweetcornsoup #indochinese #desichinesesoup #desichinesefood #ilovedesichinese #nostagia #soupkindaday #soupkindaweather #comfortinabowl #soupytime #veggiesoup #vegansoup #vegansouprecipe #veganbowl #lockdowndiaries #foodstylingandphotography","NumberOfLikes":71,"Hashtags":["#letscornit","#letscornit","#sweetcornsoup","#indochinese","#desichinesesoup","#desichinesefood","#ilovedesichinese","#nostagia","#soupkindaday","#soupkindaweather","#comfortinabowl","#soupytime","#veggiesoup","#vegansoup","#vegansouprecipe","#veganbowl","#lockdowndiaries","#foodstylingandphotography"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":10,"Timestamp":1595013916,"LocalDate":"Fri Jul 17 21:25:16 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"winilewinza","CaptionText":"Life is sooooo unpredictable!!!! #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":11,"Hashtags":["#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Winile Winza Phungula on July 17, 2020.

The COVID effect has been immense as far as damage to life and economy is concerned. The majority of the world's population lived under lockdown. However, some countries have recovered and some haven't yet. \n\nThings in India stand in a very critical corner of life as cases are growing day by day. Some cities which had almost recovered, are again facing the heat of CORONAVIRUS. The government decided to unlock life by removing some restrictions, but as the virus gets spotted again in the community, lockdown seems to be the only option.\n\nA smooth running life is now a part of the memory and nobody knows when life would be back to normal. Sometimes, A ray of hope appears, but the very next moment it fades into the darkness of uncertainty and adversity. \n\nIn the end, what remains in our control is, to wait till the situation gets better because the time when Nature starts playing its cards, man can do nothing more than being a viewers.

Right now, I am memorizing the 'Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám.'\" That is over 100 quatrains!\n\nA few days later, I asked Manong Frankie, National Artist for Literature F. Sionil Jose, the same thing. \"Well, I read, I write,\" he said. He told me he didn't memorize anything, but when I told him about Enrile and his rubáiyát, Manong Frankie suddenly broke into an oration, reciting the Gettysburg address with a flourish -- from memory!\n\nSo to practice what I preach, having written the essay on the importance of memorization in the age of Google, I put the sonnet closest to my heart -- \"When I Have Fears that I May Cease to Be\" by John Keats -- to good use.\n\nI would recite it over and over in the dead of the night while the house was asleep, eventually recording my voice with more takes than I care to admit, and also wrote each of the 14 lines by hand, to etch it deeper into my memory.\n\nNext poem to inhabit my brain forever -- \"Song: To Celia\" by Ben Jonson\n\n#poetry\n#poetsofinstagram\n#johnkeats\n#benjonson\n#vladimirnabokov\n#speakmemory\n#memorization\n#brainexercise\n#quarantinejournal\n#lockdowndiaries\n#quarantinejournal\n#lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":17,"Hashtags":["#poetry","#poetsofinstagram","#johnkeats","#benjonson","#vladimirnabokov","#speakmemory","#memorization","#brainexercise","#quarantinejournal","#lockdowndiaries","#quarantinejournal","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1594882331,"LocalDate":"Thu Jul 16 08:52:11 CEST 2020","Location":"Manila, Philippines"},{"Owner":"mandeycupido","CaptionText":"Winter is hier.\n\n#poloneck #positivevibesonly✌ #gratefull #lockdowndiaries #getoutside #hiddengems #vanniekaap #travelphotography","NumberOfLikes":39,"Hashtags":["#poloneck","#positivevibesonly✌","#gratefull","#lockdowndiaries","#getoutside","#hiddengems","#vanniekaap","#travelphotography"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Mandey Cupido on July 15, 2020.
