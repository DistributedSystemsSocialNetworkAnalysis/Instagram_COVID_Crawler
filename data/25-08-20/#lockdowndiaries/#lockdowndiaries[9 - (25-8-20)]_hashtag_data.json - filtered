I have been feeling so burnt out at work that I am operating at 50% efficiency the last two days. I am delaying writing two line emails and twenty page documents, alike. I am on social media in the daytime doing silly things, scrolling mindlessly, making jokes. No that's not me.\n\nBut I love my work, I thought. This is a busy, awesome season for my work. Lots of launches in progress. And also then there's the entire internet telling me to hustle and be productive (all with good intentions, how I consume the content is on me and not on the creator). Anyway, I am at home, so what will I do with the day off if I take it.\n\nThe answer is, nothing. Sleep, stay away from laptop, eat good food, get an intense workout in, and not feel guilty. Not sure why I am burnt out, but that's not the point. We are dealing with difficult, scary news everyday. We do housework and regular work. We haven't been able to make plans. We haven't seen family in a long time. It's okay for these things to affect me. It does not mean I don't care about my dreams or career or responsibilities. It doesn't make me weak or lazy or someone who is blind to the opportunities of this lockdown. It makes me, me. A vulnerable person who is having a tough time dealing with this and is allowed to rest till I get back to some version of normal.\n\nIf you have felt anything like me at all, please know that it's more common than ever before. And it's okay for you to take a break and not feel guilty about it. A little bit of self compassion please. If you're able to do a lot in these times, you are an amazing person and I am proud of you. If you are just able to manage life one day at a time and somedays not even that, you are still amazing and I am still proud of you.

We self isolated and another two days later is was my brother who tested positive! We were now \u201Cclose contacts\u201D - Knowing festivities were just days away we had to make the incredibly difficult decision to postpone... amongst the anxiety of awaiting our results! (Which were thankfully, negative!)\n😣\nWe moved everything 1 year out... The date was rather significant and it seemed like the safest thing to do at the time. We did it just before that decision was taken out of our hands - the country went into a nationwide lockdown (starting the day of our \u201Cwedding\u201D - 27 March 2020)\n😬\nIts been one crazy roller coaster of emotions - and some days are a little more challenging than others.

All I can think about is when I'm going to be able to start another round of IVF and I'm not sure I have the energy to deal with anything else. I don't want to talk to people about what I'm doing, have to explain what's wrong with me or why I have to keep having time off. I've been exhausted and in pain alot of time through this cycle and I'm aware I've been very lucky not to have to work this time. I was finding one of my jobs very stressful and felt I was at a crossroads with it prior to lockdown, I can't afford to leave and not knowing what the future holds makes it hard to try and make career changes right now. On top of that I work in a very social space dealing with a lot of people - one of the reasons I used to love my job - but I've been on my own for so long now being social freaks me out a little bit! I've definitely forgotten how to be around people. I love my personal training and the thought of a few hours a week doing that would be lovely but sadly I can't afford to do just that... So today I've mostly been in denial, napping and trying not to get too anxious about everything!!

Everything works out following a particular pattern. And every pattern follows a rhythm. Contrasts look mesmerizing as in unaided sight, don't they? But what we don't discern is the blend of the two contrasts, coexisting in between them, even without their own knowledge. The merge that makes the two contrasts, contrasting. The perfect blend creates a bond - a cosmos. It's there, right there. Yet, we fail to acknowledge its aura. \n\nThe pattern appeals more to us now because of the blend. It won't be long before we clock the transition. In introspect, we shall descry another realm hinged to it. A mead of solace and cheer, where we'd surely run back to, given a choice. It has a rare rhythm that sets our souls onto a pirouette; one that we'll least expect to discover over a dozen moons and cosmic sunsets. \n\nA transition, we hear, is a passing phase. Yet, it's capable of holding the contrasts in perfect harmony. Maybe on the thirteenth moon, the blend would be gone, giving way back to the contrasts. Or maybe, the contrasts would finally realise how they're nothing but spitting images of one another. Standing at the edge, across a burnt bridge, we'll see the setting rays fall directly over our blend of contrasting equals and prohibitions. We'll know where we belong; each owning a key each to our mien. Because we are the contrasts. It's exactly in the blend where we shed our inhibitions, in our little moment of transience, before being transmuted back to contrasts. Keeping up with the delusions on purpose, we love to dwell in the blends, secretly in our own cocooned contrasting commotions. \n\nIt's our pattern to stay in denial.\nWe deny to accept. We fear it's too perfect.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#sunsetlover #skyporn #skylover #dusk #sunsetphotography #photooftheday #artblogger #artoftheday #sunset_ig #instagram #instapic #instalike #instalife #sunset_love #instagram #igdaily #igersdaily #igdailytoday #instagood #instamood #igers #igtravel #igaddict #stayhome #staysafe #quarantine #quarantineandchill #lockdown #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":59,"Hashtags":["#sunsetlover","#skyporn","#skylover","#dusk","#sunsetphotography","#photooftheday","#artblogger","#artoftheday","#sunset_ig","#instagram","#instapic","#instalike","#instalife","#sunset_love","#instagram","#igdaily","#igersdaily","#igdailytoday","#instagood","#instamood","#igers","#igtravel","#igaddict","#stayhome","#staysafe","#quarantine","#quarantineandchill","#lockdown","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Roshni on July 14, 2020.

I remember when my mother-in-law used to be amazed by how motivated I was to run marathon after marathon race in my long-distance running days.

What I do I am passionate about and it\u2019s important to me - it\u2019s actually as simple as that.\n.\nTo develop unstoppable motivation, you need to identify the things that you're truly the most inspired by, and then spend every day dedicated to them.\nYour goals, your vision and everything that you need to do in order to achieve them, should be all the motivation you need to feel deeply inspired and motivated every single day.\n.\nIf that\u2019s not the case, then maybe something\u2019s gotta give\u2026but only you know the answer to that question! 😊\n.\nTell me below what motivates you!\n.\n📷 @fionacaroline\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#fitness #wellness #motivation #motivationiskey #gratitude #motivation #mondaymotivation #motivationmonday #londonpersonaltrainer #chiswickpt #gratitudedaily #bepositive #behappy #healthyliving #healthylifestyle #fitspo  #lockdowndiaries #positivity #lifegoals #selflove #selfcare #purpose #mentalhealth #mantra #mindfulness #motivational #motivations #motivationalquote #motivationforlife #motivationalwords","NumberOfLikes":77,"Hashtags":["#fitness","#wellness","#motivation","#motivationiskey","#gratitude","#motivation","#mondaymotivation","#motivationmonday","#londonpersonaltrainer","#chiswickpt","#gratitudedaily","#bepositive","#behappy","#healthyliving","#healthylifestyle","#fitspo","#lockdowndiaries","#positivity","#lifegoals","#selflove","#selfcare","#purpose","#mentalhealth","#mantra","#mindfulness","#motivational","#motivations","#motivationalquote","#motivationforlife","#motivationalwords"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by YASMINE SAY - CHISWICK PT on July 13, 2020 tagging @sweatybetty.

Johnson reached the site first & was trying to secure the animal who was in a precarious situation. \n\nA young pup had apparently fallen down from the terrace into the narrow space between these two buildings and had gotten stuck somewhere near the first floor level (between the narrow window ledges\/sajjas). It had no way of going up or down. It had been that way for three days apparently! (*plz call your nearest animal welfare org immediately if you ever witness something like this) \n\nRescuers Johnson and Bheem literally squeezed through a tiny window on the first floor of one building, walked on these precarious ledges, secured the pup and brought it back! \n\nRemember, they are walking at the first floor level between two buildings. \n\nThey rescued & released the pup who was completely unhurt and thrilled to be free again. 🙏❤💪🏽\n\nKudos, Bheem & Johnson and all community members who looked out for this pup! \n\nThat's what our Sunday was like. \n#rescue #shelterlife #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":110,"Hashtags":["#rescue","#shelterlife","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1594658438,"LocalDate":"Mon Jul 13 18:40:38 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"yashmak_yarn_hijabs","CaptionText":"#Repost @boombat_mumma (@get_repost)\n・・・\nLiving a simple life ...\n.\n.\n.\n.\n. \u201CIf one's life is simple, contentment has to come.

Everyone got so happy that we've got some untimely vacation yayyyy!!!\nFast forward to today 13th of July it's been 122 DAYS 🙂 freaking ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO DAYS of quarantine and lockdown nd during all this time I've just gone out of my house only 2 times and that too for just a few hours and right now all is just so messed up everyone around us is on edge nowadays there is frustration, fear, anger leading on to other different emotions. \nSo please be kind to one another, be patient you don't know what the other person might be going through and try adding some healthy habits some positivity in your life. Appreciate one another and most importantly ignore the negativity don't indulge into that try to be the bigger person which i know is hard sometimes when you just want to slap the hell out of someone 👋 but AVOID that 😂 \nMake time for yourself watch a good movie or a sitcom to uplift your mood or talk to a friend do what works for you.\nTry to give yourself at least one hour without your phone or laptop. Spend time with your family or go for a walk, exercise a bit or just meditate for some while. Having so much of screen time also adds on to the anxiety.

We know it. It's rocked the world over. Some days you may find yourself asking, \"When will things go back to normal?\" The loss of a sense of community and routine is irreplaceable, but that doesn't mean we have lost our ability to adapt. We can adapt, as history has proven time and again throughout the centuries. \n.\n🔅𝔖𝔥𝔬𝔲𝔩𝔡 𝔶𝔬𝔲 𝔞𝔠𝔠𝔢𝔭𝔱 𝔱𝔥𝔢 𝔠𝔲𝔯𝔯𝔢𝔫𝔱 𝔰𝔱𝔞𝔱𝔢 𝔬𝔣 𝔞𝔣𝔣𝔞𝔦𝔯𝔰?🔅\nTLDR; yes, you should.\nNow hear me out. Acceptance here doesn't mean giving in. On the contrary, it means that accepting the fact that things have changed, and instead of resisting, we let it flow over us and change ourselves according to it. It means that we take walks around the space in our house instead of going out, be our own baristas instead of ordering out, start-up a food blog instead of trying new restaurants. These \"new\" habits will take time to form, but when they're a part of your life, you will feel more in tune with yourself and in control of what is happening around you. \n.\n🔅𝔦𝔱'𝔰 𝔬𝔨𝔞𝔶 𝔱𝔬 𝔣𝔢𝔢𝔩 𝔲𝔭𝔰𝔢𝔱 𝔴𝔥𝔢𝔫 𝔱𝔥𝔦𝔫𝔤𝔰 𝔡𝔬𝔫'𝔱 𝔴𝔬𝔯𝔨 𝔬𝔲𝔱🔅\nIt's okay to feel negative. They are valid feelings. But do try to understand, if these responses are necessary for the event or if you need to shift your thoughts. Making time for yourself during the day will reduce any anxious feelings you have. You don't need to follow a rigid schedule. Some days can go good; others may be worse off. As long as there is something to keep you moving along, that is good enough. Lastly, build a strong community presence in your life by staying connected and in touch with people. You don't know how much you need it. This affects us all so we can only overcome this if\nwe come together.\n. \n🐈💌🙆🏽\u200D♀️","NumberOfLikes":15,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1594621983,"LocalDate":"Mon Jul 13 08:33:03 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"rang_aur_dhaga","CaptionText":"#sketchbook #lockdowndiaries  #follow rang_aur_dhaga","NumberOfLikes":16,"Hashtags":["#sketchbook","#lockdowndiaries","#follow"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Handmade Stuff by Heaven on July 13, 2020.

Meditate: Meditation helps you to have control on your mind, It really helps me to manage my anxious and let me be more clear about the current situation. \n2. Listen to podcasts:  I didn't use to like podcasts, however having free time I started to listen podcast about my passions, and this really helps to develop projects; have knowledge about a topic you love, or just to empower yourself with positive advices.\n3. Read: Honestly, I don't like read but I found topics that I love and I feel so good when I'm reading about them; so find your fav subject and soak up that.\n4. Cook: I love cooking!!But if you don\u2019t like it, try different recipes either by your own or with your family, partner or friends. Have fun making pizza🥰, vegan dishes, cakes, BBQ ribs...\n5. Contact your loved ones: Call your family, friends or partner, talk about how you feel and ask how they are going as well. It\u2019s a way to not feel alone🖤\n6. Contact with nature: Walk out of your home and walk at least 10 in a park, lake or beach. Take fresh air and soak up the good energy of nature.\n7. Move and stretch your body: This does not mean that you have to do a training you dont enjoy, this means: move your body in the way you think it feels good like dancing, pilates, yoga, walking, cardio or just stretch your body at least 10 min a day. This is a powerful tool to feel good ,vital, and proud of yourself during this time.\n8. Make cool plans at home: Make different plans at home, picnic in the terrace, tacos 🌮or movie night🍿, spa day with your partner or by yourself 🧖🏽\u200D♀️, family board games or try a new makeup tutorial💄.\n9. Follow powerful accounts: Use better the social media to have some lightheartedness that helps you to maintain the positive thoughts; follow people that inspire you, that gives you good energy and good advices. This highly help me a lot!!\n\n#selflove #selfcare #selfesteem #helpingothers #freesoul #energyhealing #lockdown #lockdowndiaries #lockdownlife #quarentine #positivemindset #postivethoughts #adviceoftheday #blogger #alonetogether #intuitiveeating #guidance","NumberOfLikes":54,"Hashtags":["#selflove","#selfcare","#selfesteem","#helpingothers","#freesoul","#energyhealing","#lockdown","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdownlife","#quarentine","#positivemindset","#postivethoughts","#adviceoftheday","#blogger","#alonetogether","#intuitiveeating","#guidance"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1594606686,"LocalDate":"Mon Jul 13 04:18:06 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"themaidastouch","CaptionText":"\u201CEvery day is a good day.\u201D - zen koan.

It fills my heart with joy whenever I see she is absorbed in a book.\nI am a #bookaholic. Reading is like taking breath for me. Hell, I am a judgy person. I judge other person on the basis of they read or not (totally kidding 😆).\nI have read to my dd from the time she was 6 months old. I still read to her several times a day and ofcourse we have mandatory story time at night.\nShe loved me reading to her and always telling me to read to her but she does not like to read by herself. Maybe it takes too much effort because she is not very proficient reader still now. This fact makes me wonder whether she will love book like me or not. \nThis thought always makes me sad cause it was always my preconceived notion that she would love reading, no matter what. This expectation is very messed up and should not be there at all. My dd is her own person and she would grow up to be exactly like someone she wants to be.\nAnyway, in this lockdown, from last one week she has started reading on her own randomly. So, imperfect as I am, I feel joy, happiness. I feel like my purpose is served. My dream has come true. I know,,, I know ,,,, if is too premature.....\nBut a girl can hope, right? 😆😇😇❤\n\n#raisednatural #bookaholics #raisethemright #bookworm #parentexpectations #lockdowndiaries #goodhabits #moanabook","NumberOfLikes":28,"Hashtags":["#bookaholic.","#raisednatural","#bookaholics","#raisethemright","#bookworm","#parentexpectations","#lockdowndiaries","#goodhabits","#moanabook"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Aritri Banerjee on July 12, 2020.

For many people with chronic illnesses it\u2019s not a far cry from our daily lives - I am used to not seeing my friends for weeks on end, not going to work and often not being able to leave my house however the whole world experienced that together which made it way more challenging than usual. As shielding in Scotland hopefully comes to a close, I am able to reflect on the experience and say that I have felt safe and supported. Once the Scottish government and my CF team found their feet, I wholeheartedly trusted and followed their guidelines and advice. The times I didn\u2019t feel safe were down to irrational members of the public flaunting the rules so I really can\u2019t criticise the people in power for those actions. The week before lockdown and the couple of weeks that followed were daunting for everyone but as someone highly vulnerable that relied on hospital treatment regularly, I was terribly anxious. However, my fears never came to fruition. I did receive care from my CF team and I always had food in my cupboards (even if it was tinned fruit and tuna lol). I\u2019m incredibly proud of how my family, friends and local authority dealt with the pandemic. There were bumps in the road but we\u2019ve made it this far. Really well done and thank you to those that have thought twice about their own actions\/movements\/behaviours and in turn considered the effects they could be having on those shielding. At this point in the management of the pandemic in Scotland, the government must ensure that there\u2019s not a cliff edge of support for those that are vulnerable and it\u2019s the responsibility of the general public to remain vigilant and respect social distancing as extremely vulnerable people integrate back into society. As shielding hopefully comes to a close in Scotland, I pray that all vulnerable people will be able to slot back in, in the knowledge that they are safe.","NumberOfLikes":93,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Kirsty 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿👩🏼\u200D🏫 on July 12, 2020.

Überhaupt verströmt das siebte Studioalbum trotz aller tragischen Dorfgeschichten direkt vom Deich (\"Stine\") und kritischen Auseinandersetzungen mit den nordischen Nazi-Wurzeln (\"Rattenlinie Nord\") mehr Hoffnung in einer Note als jedes Mark Forster-Album. \"Wer den Schnee umarmt, wird die Kälte akzeptieren.\" CHECK ALL RECORDS >>> LINK IN DER BIO!\n\n#zwischenzeugnis #lockdowndiaries #bestalbums #bestalbumssofar #bestof2020 #pop #rock #indie #folk #rap #deutschrap #hiphop #metal #jazz #electronic #turbostaat #uthlande #lautde #linkinbio","NumberOfLikes":57,"Hashtags":["#zwischenzeugnis","#lockdowndiaries","#bestalbums","#bestalbumssofar","#bestof2020","#pop","#rock","#indie","#folk","#rap","#deutschrap","#hiphop","#metal","#jazz","#electronic","#turbostaat","#uthlande","#lautde","#linkinbio"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by laut.de on July 11, 2020.

Like everyone else, I jumped on the self improvement bandwagon. In response to Covid, Harvard University rolled out a number of coveted courses for free, with optional grading & assignments for a fee. \n.\nI signed up for a 10 week course on the health effects of climate change.

Every corporate decision & government policy that's geared towards ignoring the environment impacts our health today and in the future.\n.\nEven what is happening right now, Covid, has a thread to climate change.\nIt's alarming, but I believe there is a light.

M was super excited when the saplings came out about 10 days later. Then the plants just kept growing until it took over quarter of the raised bed in a couple of months time but no signs of any flower buds. I was getting impatient and thought of chopping it off but didn't. Finally the buds started to grow late June and now I think they are the best flowers we grew in the garden.
