Thankfully, past government funding for research about disaster response has produced some resources we can adapt, so we don't have to start at square one in figuring out how to care for ourselves, support others, and care for our communities.\n. \n.\n.\n\nBased on that work, we can expect some emotional tumbling in the weeks and months to come. Rather than responding with fear, consider this an invitation to make a plan. Considering now how we can plan to give ourselves extraordinary care and check-in more with the people we care about in the coming months can help support ourselves and others into the recovery phase.\n.\n \n.\n\nDid you know the are FREE manuals for best-practices for doing #mentalhealth and other person-to-person care in the aftermath of a disaster? I've posted a link to two of my favorites on my website - click the link in my profile then \"disaster response.\"\n\n.\n.\n.\n\nAs I thought about this graphic in the context of disaster, I realized that it extends to many single-event #collectivetrauma -like how a family responds to a sudden death in the family, how a small town might respond to the closing of a major employer, or how an identity group might respond to a single-event hate crime.  NOTE: for the black community and many other marginalized groups, trauma is *ongoing*. Although it's not the topic of this post, the impact of this chronic stress is profound, very different, and requires our attention. Check out @thewe_collective for good educational content in this area. \n.\n.\n.\n\nThis graph (adapted from an open-source resource published by the US Department of Health and Human Services using WA-DOH data to locate our \"we are here\") can be downloaded in poster form via my website. \n.\n.\n.\n\nNotice that the baseline after recovery from the event is just a little higher than before- that's a very cool thing called #posttraumaticgrowth - in which things we learned about ourselves in recovery produce positive gains long term. 🙌\n.\n.\n.\n#pandemicmentalhealth #mentalhealthillustration","NumberOfLikes":3,"Hashtags":["#Repost","#pandemic","#mentalhealth","#collectivetrauma","#posttraumaticgrowth","#pandemicmentalhealth","#mentalhealthillustration"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Lora-Amoret 🍄 on August 25, 2020.

Urban flight and a new desire for a more work-at-home space fueled the growth. As measured by signed contracts, new home sales jumped 13.9% compared with June and were a remarkable 36.3% higher annually, according to the U.S. Census. \n✅\nStrong demand sucked up the inventory of newly built homes for sale, which fell to a four-month supply from a 4.7-month supply in June. Low supply and strong demand made it easier for builders to raise prices. The median price of a newly built home sold in July was $330,600, an increase of 7.2% compared with July 2019.\n✅\nThe new home market has everything going for it right now including limited resale supply, fear of missing out, heightened dissatisfaction of our current living situation, low mortgage rates, and months of saving money. Buyers are taking advantage of low mortgage rates, which give them additional purchasing power but also tend to juice home prices. Regionally, sales gains were strongest in the Midwest and the South but dropped in the Northeast on a monthly basis. #realestateinvesting #mortgagebrokers #investing #economics #datascience #business #financialservices #billionaireboysclub #mortgageloanofficer #financialliteracy #pandemic","NumberOfLikes":3,"Hashtags":["#realestateinvesting","#mortgagebrokers","#investing","#economics","#datascience","#business","#financialservices","#billionaireboysclub","#mortgageloanofficer","#financialliteracy","#pandemic"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by DAklin, MSc on August 25, 2020.

I heard more about the challenges they're facing at this point in the COVID-19 public health crisis.\n.\nWe discussed the strategies they've developed to overcome logistical hurdles and initial issues with testing. The department has now organized more than 40 testing events in Henrico communities. I also spoke with Virginia Secretary of Health Daniel Carey about the state-level response. Ongoing issues that were raised include the need for call center support, increased testing in our #VA07 communities, and PPE for vulnerable groups & frontline workers. We also agreed that telehealth will be a vital tool in the months to come. Finally, we discussed how we can best support minority and low-income communities in Central Virginia who have been disproportionately hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n.\nI want to thank Secretary Carey, Medical Director Dr. Avula, and the entire Henrico Health Department for their tireless work during this crisis. Your commitment to our community, ingenuity in the face of obstacles, and selfless perseverance are saving lives in our district.\n.\nAs health departments across the state continue to battle this pandemic, I encourage Central Virginians to make use of COVIDWISE.

In times of crisis, this can be lifesaving if sterilization of bottles was not available.\n🦠 Lastly, but possibly most importantly, breastmilk changes to meet the needs of your baby or toddler! Your breastmilk responds to your environment by creating antibodies to fight any unwanted bacteria or viruses. By kissing, smelling, and nibbling on your baby, you are taking in their environment and creating antibodies to fight anything that your little one may be fighting. Your breastmilk will then contain the antibodies that your baby will benefit from!\n✨Breastmilk really is an amazing substance! It\u2019s not magic, it\u2019s science! 💪\n\n🦠Did you find that your baby didn\u2019t get sick much while you were breastfeeding?\n✨Were you able to feel the effects of those hormone releases??\n👇 Tell us about it in the comments 👇\n✨Sign up for our breastfeeding class this Thursday to learn more!✨\n@breezybirthcentralvalley \n#breastfeeding #breastmilkmagic #covid_19 #pandemic #2020 #breastmilk #parenting","NumberOfLikes":6,"Hashtags":["#breastfeeding","#breastmilkmagic","#covid_19","#pandemic","#2020","#breastmilk","#parenting"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Emily Garcia on August 25, 2020.

It is staying in this moment. Keeping your mind in the present focusing on what is happening right now versus letting your mind jump into the unknown future. Remaining calm. \n\nPositive thoughts are just as important. They keep your mind pointed in the direction you want to be going. Sometimes the power of thinking leads to a self fulfilling prophecy (your behavior leads you in a direction that the thoughts become true). \n\n#psychology #psychologist #tips #postivevibes #positivethinking #positivity #positivemindset #mindful #mindfulness #sunflower #sunflowers #quotes #motivationalquotes #inspirationalquotes #inspiration #pandemic #stress #calm (photo: @rosaliasphotos)","NumberOfLikes":24,"Hashtags":["#psychology","#psychologist","#tips","#postivevibes","#positivethinking","#positivity","#positivemindset","#mindful","#mindfulness","#sunflower","#sunflowers","#quotes","#motivationalquotes","#inspirationalquotes","#inspiration","#pandemic","#stress","#calm"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Dr. Susan Albers on August 25, 2020.

For my subject, it involved a change in her work away from the limits of sitting in front of a computer screen. The social distancing necessitated by the #pandemic accentuated her yearning for more one on one interaction in the non clinical side of palliative care. \nAt first I found her message a bit vague and felt at a loss in trying to visualize my #drawing . Thinking about the broader context of the course of our situational journey contributed perspective. She had just written about her feelings about concluding this experience and likened her emails to messages in a bottle. Although this metaphor has ancient roots in scientific inquiry, it also carries an inescapable romantic valence of a yearning to be found. Given that our relationship is bound by computer and related screens, was she speaking to more than career matters when wishing for more than what an online situation can offer?\nIn this light, the above words of #poet #sylviaplath may speak to the underpinnings of her missive.

Though the HEPA standard and certification process wasn't established until 1983, development of HEPA filters dates back to World War 2, when American scientists with the Manhattan project created the first HEPA filter to capture radioactive particles released during the creation of the atomic bomb.💣\n\nMost modern day HEPA filters consist of interlaced glass fibers that are twisted and turned in myriad directions to create a fibrous maze. As particles traverse this web, they're taken out of circulation either via direct impaction, sieving, interception or diffusion.\n\nHEPA filters were originally intended to be used in lab and factory settings. Today, they've also made their way into consumer products, including cars, vacuum cleaners, and air purifiers.\n\nEach filter comes with a MERV Rating, which stands for Maximum Efficiency Reporting Values. This reports a filter's ability to capture larger particles between 0.3 and 10 microns. The higher the MERV Rating, the better the filter is at trapping specific types of particles.\n\nThis is an extremely important concept to learn during times such as COVID-19, it only helps you prepare yourself better for the future.\n\n#techgeek #nerdlife #learn #hepafilter #filter #bsl2 #biosafety #filters #incubator #cellculture #geek #inquisitive #explore #research #interesting #growthmindset #covid19 #pandemic #geauxengineering #lsuengineering #bioengineering #mechanicalengineering","NumberOfLikes":23,"Hashtags":["#techgeek","#nerdlife","#learn","#hepafilter","#filter","#bsl2","#biosafety","#filters","#incubator","#cellculture","#geek","#inquisitive","#explore","#research","#interesting","#growthmindset","#covid19","#pandemic","#geauxengineering","#lsuengineering","#bioengineering","#mechanicalengineering"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Filter","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598382886,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 21:14:46 CEST 2020","Location":"LSU College of Engineering"},{"CaptionText":"It's a blessing to do the work I do.

I've now worked at the most beautiful restaurant I've been a part of, Lindey's in German Village, for over a year and riding the restaurant rollercoaster that has been 2020 has brought me so much gratitude. We are a family owned spot with an incredible reputation that people trust, and for good reason. \n\nI've heard the news regarding new protocols weeks before some friends in the industry, our managers have thought about protecting us before we even knew what covid would become and worked above anyone else I've heard to keep their staff informed and not left alone to worry, or worse laid off without warning or any efforts of protection. This pandemic has put the restaurant world under very harsh lighting, but somehow our team is still able to pull off high-quality service and it blows my mind how everyone around me has risen to this horrific occasion.

The skin around my mouth and chin area has been so irritated by wearing an N95 mask and additional mask all day. I have broken out as I did during my teenage years!  My autoimmune patients who are on steroids (which also may cause acne) are suffering BIG TIME!\u2060\n_\u2060\nWe now know the term \u201Cmascne\u201D  is acne or irritation from wearing a mask for prolonged periods.  It is caused by a buildup of oil and sweat which is trapped under the mask in addition to the humidity and heat of mask-wearing especially during summertime. Our skin may be triggered to produce more oil and other inflammatory chemicals can be produced.  Also if you are not washing the mask after use, the leftover dirt, sweat, and bacteria can create the ideal environment for bacteria to grow. \u2060\n_\u2060\nWhat can we do?\u2060\n_\u2060\nWash our masks frequently. I wear a cotton blend mask on the way to and from work and wash immediately when I get home.\u2060\n_\u2060\nNO MAKEUP!!! As much as ladies want to look their best, any makeup will worsen the skin issues.\u2060\n_\u2060\nI am now taking my mask off midday for about 45 minutes to let my face breathe a little.\u2060\n_\u2060\nKeep the area hydrated and moisturized! Don't over-exfoliate!\u2060\n_\u2060\nSeek a dermatologist's opinion! I had to start using a salicylic acid acne wash and benzoyl peroxide treatment (2.5 % concentration), a topical antibiotic and retinoid to help. \u2060\n_\u2060\nI also do a quick wash with a gentle cleanser during the middle of the day because oil and dirt do accumulate on the skin at work. I have been using a product with vitamin E and alpha hydroxy acid.\u2060\n\nREDUCE STRESS and EAT HEALTHY MEALS!\n_\u2060\nRemember that despite this annoying complication, we must continue to wear masks because it protects others and yourself from COVID 19 exposure.

While many Torontonians celebrate stage 3 of reopening, individuals experiencing homelessness continue to face the systemic barriers that have cost them their basic safety and security before and during the pandemic.  \n\nDuring the first stage of the pandemic, emergency orders were put in place by the government of Ontario to protect individuals from the virus. This included the closures of non-essential businesses, public places, and restrictions on social gatherings. For our Torontonians experiencing homelessness, this meant they needed to rely on city and non-profit shelters for their basic necessities like food, a bed to sleep on, and washrooms to use.\n\nRead the rest of this article on our blog, www.streetvoices.ca - link in bio!\n\n#streetvoices #blog #homelessness #toronto #writer #systematicbarriers #homeless #encampment #downtown #covid19 #pandemic #coronavirus #lockdown #shelters #crisis #youth #adults #people","NumberOfLikes":12,"Hashtags":["#Repost","#streetvoices","#blog","#homelessness","#toronto","#writer","#systematicbarriers","#homeless","#encampment","#downtown","#covid19","#pandemic","#coronavirus","#lockdown","#shelters","#crisis","#youth","#adults","#people"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Ashley on August 25, 2020.

It would be lovely if you could subscribe, please 🥰. Link in bio.\nEveryone has had a different experience throughout this pandemic. Some experiences will be relatable to others. Of course, I am aware that people have lost there loved ones because of this virus and that is so painful. We all FEEL different emotions because we all have different experiences throughout life and that is ok. Yes, we can put things in perspective, but we should never feel guilty for how we FEEL. For example, My Grandad passed away in January then 2 months later my Granny had to isolate for so many weeks on her own. I can\u2019t relate to that, but I\u2019m able to understand that would have been very difficult for her. I can\u2019t relate to all the long hours the NHS staff would have had to work to help the patients, but I\u2019m able to appreciate and acknowledge them for all their hard work ✨.\nI, however, have had so many changes throughout this lockdown. My relationship ended, I lost my job because I had to move from London to Newcastle in the height of the pandemic in April. Bearing in mind I had just made all these new changes in December to leave a job in the NHS up north so I could move to London and commit to my relationship. Anyways that was my story I kept on telling myself, but it\u2019s not anymore as I have had to change my mindset instead of being my own self-pity party. It takes me a while to get used to change and settle into things, therefore I have struggled with all these changes again. Although I\u2019m not the type of person to adapt to change quickly I don\u2019t ever want this to put me off from making other big changes in my life again. Change = Growth 💛\nMy mental health has struggled a little bit in lockdown and I know I won\u2019t be the only one. I haven\u2019t felt depressed, but I have felt very sad and frustrated some days. I know this has to do with my situation, but others might have felt anxious\/depressed because they have been alone in this or maybe they have just had so much fear with the way the world is.

However, even this bare minimum precaution caused an uproar in society. People complain that they cannot breathe while wearing a mask or that it is against their human rights to be forced to wear a mask. For the first of these two concerns, I ask you to consider how easily you would be able to breathe if you had contracted the coronavirus, which often causes coughing and shortness of breath. Furthermore, you should only be in places where you need masks for a brief period of time. For the lather complaint, I implore you to be more selfless. Wearing a mask is not only a way to protect yourself against the coronavirus spread, but it, more importantly, protects other people from you. If you are unable to wear a mask to protect yourself, think of your parents, your grandparents, or even your great-grandparents. Wear a mask for them.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nWant to join the team?

For me it is having the time to enjoy the simple things in life, from watching nature change into its finest clothing has been a real joy, it has allowed a sense of connection with nature and wildlife on a deeper level. The time to share a chat with neighbours that we hardly ever spoke to before and the real camaraderie of sharing and helping one another is one that I hope will last into the future, it has been so comforting to know that others too have the time to converse and are willing to do so, rather than racing off to face another working day. These are all pretty simple things but have made a huge difference in peoples lives, especially those that live alone and long may it continue. I have added some of my drawings that I have been working on during this time, which is my way of using all the extra time to be creative which in turn helps to diffuse the impact of the pandemic. #contemporaryart #oilpastel #oilpastels #oilpastelonpaper #landscapedrawing #drawing #drawings #covid19 #covid_19 #covid  #lockdown #lockdown2020 #lockdownlife #lockdowndiaries #pandemic #pandemic2020 #wellbeing #wellbeingjourney #mindfulness #mindful","NumberOfLikes":58,"Hashtags":["#contemporaryart","#oilpastel","#oilpastels","#oilpastelonpaper","#landscapedrawing","#drawing","#drawings","#covid19","#covid_19","#covid","#lockdown","#lockdown2020","#lockdownlife","#lockdowndiaries","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#wellbeing","#wellbeingjourney","#mindfulness","#mindful"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Elaine Fox on August 25, 2020.

COVID-19 restrictions have eliminated many of our opportunities to build friendships and network with colleagues. Many of us are now working, schooling, and worshiping from home, severing limiting our social circles. As a result, psychologists are reporting higher rates of depression. More than ever, we can see the crucial role community and connectedness contribute to our well-being. We need friends.\n.\nIn this episode, @ErinStraza and @hannah_._anderson dig into their Getting By summer miniseries. Each episode of the series includes a special guest who has something specific to share about how we can get by in life considering the world as it is today. Gina Dalfonzo @gina.dalfonzo joins this conversation to help us see the value of nurturing friendships even in the most dire of circumstances. Her latest release from Baker Publishing, The Remarkable Friendship Between C. S. Lewis and Dorothy L. Sayers, provides a template for us. While Lewis is well known due to his Chronicles of Narnia series, Sayers may be relatively unknown. She was a wildly successful mystery novelist, best known for her Lord Peter Wimsey Series. This friendship is set against the backdrop of World War II; the unrest and uncertainty of their time parallels that of ours. By looking at their friendship\u2014developed primarily via letters over a 15-year stretch\u2014provides a picture of how we too could develop or maintain deep friendships even during difficult times. Conversation touches on the powerful way friendships can feed and shape our souls\u2014as well as the trajectory of our very lives.

Our love is not fragile. This bond is stronger than a pandemic, a feared serious diagnosis, the loss of a loved one, trauma, attachement triggers, a disagreement and some other personal problems. \n✨\nAt the beginning of the year I wrote in my journal: \"Tell me that I'm too much! Push me away! Go and leave me!\" I felt ashamed. I said to my therapist \"I feel like something died.\" I was so scared that Michaela got tired of me and that I was about to lose her because she didn't have time for me anymore and I felt this lack of authenticity which made me feel unseen and disconnected. What used to strenghten me suddenly felt like a weakness. \n✨\nToday my therapist opened the session by telling me that she saw the video of this beautiful reunion. In retrospect the beginning of the session was really meaningful even though I couldn't really allow it to fully affect me in the moment itself because I was so caught up in my defensiveness. Our brains are wired for connection but trauma rewires them for protection. \n✨\nI've been unable to cry in sessions for a while but to her the tears come so effortlessly when we're together. She allows me to see when something touches her. It feels almost ridiculous that I was sitting there, squeezed in the corner because a part of me felt rejected because she isn't allowed to greet me with a hug anymore. Meanwhile she sat right in front of me with tears in her eyes as she described me how moved she is by the joy and love that could be seen on Michaela's face as we held eachother. Isn't it insane how hard my system is trying to find a reason to protect me from loving and feeling loved? \n✨\nWe locked eyes and she said: \"This love has been there all the time. Even if you're gonna be apart for another 160 days, this love is always inside of you.\" It didn't get lost in all the chaos. I couldn't always feel it but I was fighting hard to hold on to it.  After everything we've been through, it feels like this relationship survived the end of the world. This love is invincible.\nNo matter which hardships life is gonna throw at us in the future, time has proven that nothing can tear us apart for good.❤️","NumberOfLikes":41,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":9,"Timestamp":1598286202,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 24 18:23:22 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"🏀⚽️🎾🏐🏉🏒. ______________\n\nOnesie \n \nThe onesie we use is always 100% cotton.

I'm  not complaining  though, most of the time I prefer the company of animals\/pets. Because, as long as you treat them well, they don't judge, they listen  or pretend to  listen, they follow you almost everywhere, and sometimes comfort you when you feel sad. 🖤💙\n\nSo now, I will make videos, once in a while, to give Fifer the Beach Cat 🐈 a break from my craziness and to share to people how crazy and weird this beach cat is.

According to MedPage Today, he says too that the application spike counters a 21st-century trend of scientifically-minded people pursuing careers in computer science over medicine.⠀\n⠀\nAlso, many schools have relaxed their admissions processes amid COVID-19, sometimes encouraging students to apply without all of the prerequisites in place, according Jayme Bograd, AACOM's director of application services. Bograd also claims the pandemic has meant prospective medical students have had more time to research medical schools and work on applications.⠀\n⠀\nWant to find or apply for your dream med school?

Over time, smallpox spread across the globe through the growth of civilizations and trade routes. The most dramatic case of smallpox spreading was the first contact between Europe and the Americas. It is estimated that the smallpox the Europeans carried with them killed up to 90% of the population of the Americas. Smallpox was such a devastating disease because on average three out of ten infected people died, and many survivors were left with severe scars. The world began to turn a corner on smallpox in 1796 when the English doctor Edward Jenner developed the technique of variolation, a more primitive form of vaccination. From then on, vaccination became the scientifically accepted way to prevent smallpox. In 1959, the World Health Organization began a campaign of mass-vaccination in an attempt to eradicate smallpox forever. After eighteen years of work, the last naturally occurring case of smallpox, a hospital cook in Somalia, was diagnosed in 1977. The story of smallpox is a hopeful one; one that shows even the worst diseases can be banished from earth through effective, collective effort. \n#smallpox #disease #diseaseprevention #pandemic #who #vaccine #history #1977 #dailyhistory","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#smallpox","#disease","#diseaseprevention","#pandemic","#who","#vaccine","#history","#1977","#dailyhistory"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598365907,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 16:31:47 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"🙃📝\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#write #creativewriting #poetry #poemoftheday #poetsofinstagram #writersofinstagram #pandemic #covid19 #washyourhands #wearamask #dontpanic #takecareofeachother #bekindalways #kansas #tuesdaythoughts #morningroutine #coffeeaddict #cloudscape","NumberOfLikes":3,"Hashtags":["#write","#creativewriting","#poetry","#poemoftheday","#poetsofinstagram","#writersofinstagram","#pandemic","#covid19","#washyourhands","#wearamask","#dontpanic","#takecareofeachother","#bekindalways","#kansas","#tuesdaythoughts","#morningroutine","#coffeeaddict","#cloudscape"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by AJ Dome in Topeka, Kansas.

Helios, supported by the Brandenburg Medical School, started in February to collect and analyze data on COVID-19 patients treated in the Helios\u2019 86 German hospitals. These and additional findings that Helios makes from the study are expected to help in the development of a treatment for the #virus.\n#Fresenius #forwardthinking #healthcare","NumberOfLikes":95,"Hashtags":["#FreseniusHelios","#COVID19","#pandemic:","#ventilation.","#Italy","#France","#UnitedKingdom","#Belgium","#virus.","#Fresenius","#forwardthinking","#healthcare"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Fresenius on August 25, 2020.

Some analysts said that the strategy of rising prices during the global crisis seems to go against logic, but it is actually an emergency mechanism for luxury brands to maintain their performance. In the short term, price increases can stimulate consumers to place orders before the price rise, increase brand cash flow, and in the long run can generate more profits and make up for the brand's loss of revenue during the epidemic.
