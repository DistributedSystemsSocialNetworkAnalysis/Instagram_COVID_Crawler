Only you know, what you need, to be safe through this pandemic. \u2063\n\u2063\n✔️2)Being transparent is not easy for many of us, trust me not even in a normal world\u2026 but being clear and straightforward about what you believe is safe, for you and your family, can really help. \u2063\n\u2063\n✔️3)It\u2019s ok if everyone does not agree with your decisions. You may even feel pressured because of your choices, but remember if your insistent on wearing your mask, you do it! \u2026.. If your insistent on social distancing \u2026. You do that too! \u2026. If your insistent on choosing a home learning plan for your child \u2026 well guess what \u2026 you do you! \u2063\n\u2063\nMany of us only have so much to fill our cups ☕️♥️ at the moment and conserving your strength, your energy and your well-being is just so much more important than feeling the pressure of others. \u2063\n\u2063\n🔴Remember this:🔴\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2022 Boundaries \u2026. they are important and guess what \u2026. your allowed to set them.\u2063\n\u2063\n#boundaries #covid19 #dowhatsbestforyou #dowhatsrightforyou #wearyourmask #maskupnevada #healthyboundaries #setboundaries #ffignv #somuchmorethanjustinsurance #betransparent #transparency #doyou #besafe #besmart #stayhealthy #staysafe #mamapreneur #momapreneur #boymomlife #momtruth #momlifebelike #vegaslocal #summerlinmom #hendersonmoms #vegasmoms #homeschoolingmom","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#pandemic","#boundaries","#covid19","#dowhatsbestforyou","#dowhatsrightforyou","#wearyourmask","#maskupnevada","#healthyboundaries","#setboundaries","#ffignv","#somuchmorethanjustinsurance","#betransparent","#transparency","#doyou","#besafe","#besmart","#stayhealthy","#staysafe","#mamapreneur","#momapreneur","#boymomlife","#momtruth","#momlifebelike","#vegaslocal","#summerlinmom","#hendersonmoms","#vegasmoms","#homeschoolingmom"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598326138,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 05:28:58 CEST 2020","Location":"Las Vegas, Nevada"},{"Owner":"boxxamillion","CaptionText":"A lot of what\u2019s unfolding now I\u2019m breaking down on this EP.

Despite all the controversy and polarized reviews, this is a great game. It\u2019s an ambitious flawed masterpiece with plenty of feels. It features a lot of LGBT characters and relationships and does a good job at showing the stigma that LGBT people face in everyday life. The game also shows how someone deals with a trauma, and how it can send a sane person down a dark path of revenge, hatred and destruction, and how this can change a person's mental state. The game also takes a look at society as a whole and makes commentary on our own by showing how the post-pandemic society in the game is living in separate divided factions of people. It shows the story from all sides and shows how all of these different people that are at war with each other are all forced to do terrible things to survive, and that none of them are really any better than each other, and they even have more alike than they all believe. It's a complex game and I feel like some people either missed out on the depth behind the story, or they got too triggered for their own political reasons.

In a country with a privatized healthcare system, this puts millions of Americans without employer-based health insurance during a global pandemic, a factor that increases the risk of adverse health outcomes for these groups.

An authoritarian regime characterised by the distortion of facts and a loss of privacy leads to the central character looking for a way out. Sound familiar? 🤔\n\nIn the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe we get to escape the cares and worries of life, trading in the stresses of our day-to-day for talking animals and the promise of a higher purpose. A must-read for anyone looking for a few moments of respite when the pressures of today prove to be challenging.

Demonstrators marched to the Portland Police Bureau\u2019s North Precinct where a riot was declared shortly after 11 p.m. Sunday, eventually leading to police deploying tear gas and arresting 23 people on the 87th night of political unrest in the city. A Black man was hospitalized in serious condition after police shot him several times in the back as he opened the door of a parked vehicle in Kenosha, Wisconsin; that man turned out to be 29 year-old Jacob Blake. The Wisconsin cops shot him in the back 7 times while his kids were in the car. The shooting sparked outrage in Kenosha, which is located nearly 40 miles south of Milwaukee, as protesters gathered at the scene of the shooting. Several businesses in the area were vandalized and about 50 cars were set on fire. City and state officials on Sunday decried the actions of about 75 people who started fires, broke windows, injured a police officer and damaged property Saturday night during an \u201CAbolish the Police\u201D protest outside the Denver Police Department\u2019s headquarters; 12 people were arrested.

This pandemic took away everything that makes me tick. In short, it caged a free spirit. Now, im face to face with my mental illnesses and this past week has been a true struggle to say the least. Having a life purpose is imperative for a person like me. Working at something bigger than myself is what soothes my soul and brings me a sense of peace and since March, I haven't been able to do that. Just me versus the demons and trust me when I tell ya, they don't mind kicking you when you're down. In fact, they love that im cornered. Prior to all this I was a beast traveling the world and lighting the lives of children who sat in the darkness by the thousands and now, the beast is sitting on my chest every morning I open my eyes while I watch children id normally be there for fight and die from behind my telephone screen. I feel useless and thats foreign to me. Dying of old age and of natural causes would be a victory in itself in the face of living through the indescribable pain my mind puts me through daily. Mental illness is very real and this pandemic has amplified it for me and so many others. If you're one of those people reading this, you're too special to become just another number in the statistics (and so am I).

Bobby shares with us his experience with Ron and the Neighborhood Playhouse. Thank you so much Bobby! We are excited to hear more from you! \"When I think of what Ron has meant to me and my time not just as a storyteller, but as a 20\/30-something trying to find his way in the world, one word comes to mind: Generous. At the Neighborhood Playhouse, his work with actors who did not consider themselves singers was wondrous and unlocked a lot of value for those he taught. In the years since, he has been so helpful in bringing myself and my projects into the Shetler Studios world, and I wouldn't have been able to get things off the ground without his trust and generosity.\"\n \n Bobby Kruger studied under Ron Shetler at the Neighborhood Playhouse.  He made his way into TV and Film work as a performer, writer, and producer.  He has since fused his love for storytelling and technology, creating narratives for PayPal and Salesforce.  He lives in New Jersey with his wife, a Drama Therapist and Playwright and their daughter. #thefinalbow #theaterisanindustry \n#shetlerstudios #documentary #support #indigogo #theatre #film #actors #actresses #playwrights #producer #director #thankyou #pandemic #thearts #supportthearts @thefinalbowdoc @bobbykruger @deborah_louise11 @jprice_ny @krystaljoybrown @shetlerstudios @michaelluggio @mel_unwind07 @lelayedwards @officialjimmylocust @jimjosephnyc @stephanielrosenberg @ashlie_atkinson @cbreslin15 @larissalaurel @truonline @mercifuldelusions @allarayofficial @dangercurvesprod","NumberOfLikes":0,"Hashtags":["#thefinalbow","#theaterisanindustry","#shetlerstudios","#documentary","#support","#indigogo","#theatre","#film","#actors","#actresses","#playwrights","#producer","#director","#thankyou","#pandemic","#thearts","#supportthearts"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The Final Bow on August 24, 2020.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598313168,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 01:52:48 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"tomo7701","CaptionText":"November 2, MMXX, 2018VP1\nWater and fire.","NumberOfLikes":167,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by 𝗧𝗢𝗠𝗢𝟳𝟳 on August 24, 2020.","NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1598312963,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 01:49:23 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"daydaywhoelse","CaptionText":"Be who you are....\nModel @pete_nice27\n\n#dwainjphotograpy # #newyork #hudsonyards #portraitphotography #pandemic\n#hudsonvalley #pose #photoshoot #look #troll #beauty #makeart #heat #behive #welcometothejungle #hometown #model #modelsearchnyc #nycphotographer #raw_community #raw_community_member","NumberOfLikes":15,"Hashtags":["#dwainjphotograpy","#newyork","#hudsonyards","#portraitphotography","#pandemic","#hudsonvalley","#pose","#photoshoot","#look","#troll","#beauty","#makeart","#heat","#behive","#welcometothejungle","#hometown","#model","#modelsearchnyc","#nycphotographer","#raw_community","#raw_community_member"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Dwain \"Day Day\" Johnson on August 24, 2020 tagging @pete_nice27.

When I moved to Spokane and started working in a sports medicine clinic it just didn\u2019t feel right. This job while familiar and comfortable just wasn\u2019t fulfilling anymore. I wanted more.

Mantan Pangkostrad itu menegaskan dirinya bersikap netral saat pilpres.\n\nSementara itu, Gatot mengaku dirinya memang sempat ditawari jabatan menteri untuk menggantikan Ryamizard Ryacudu.\n\n\"Saya pernah ditawari, zamannya Pak Jokowi, menjadi Menteri Pertahanan menggantikan Pak Ryamizard,\" ungkap mantan Pangkostrad ini.\n\nMeskipun mengapresiasi tawaran itu, Gatot menegaskan ia menolak.\n\n\"Saya nolak. Saya bilang, 'Tidak ada satu pun Panglima TNI bermimpi menjadi menteri pertahanan, tetapi sisa waktu saya di Panglima TNI saya akan menularkan tentang moral dan etika',\" paparnya.\n\nIa mengungkapkan alasannya menolak jabatan tersebut.\n\nGatot menjelaskan sebelumnya ia merasa selalu terkesan bertentangan dengan menteri pertahanan yang saat itu menjabat.\n\nGatot beralasan ada perintah yang sempat ia tentang dari menteri pertahanan ketika itu.\n\n\"Selama ini di media seolah saya bermusuhan dengan menteri pertahanan karena saya diajak latihan di Laut China Selatan dengan tentara China, saya tidak mau,\" paparnya.\n\n\"Itu saya membela pemerintah, karena pemerintah mengatakan di Laut China Selatan harus kondusif. Kalau latihan 'kan enggak kondusif. Makanya kayak marah gitu, padahal enggak ada apa-apanya,\" jelas Gatot.\n\nOleh karena itu, ia merasa harus menolak tawaran Jokowi karena tidak ingin terkesan menginginkan jabatan.\n\n\"Kalau saya terima, seolah-olah kalau kamu ingin jabatan sogok atasanmu supaya atasanmu digantikan,\" ungkap Gatot.

The 22-year-old mother, Mei Xiang, has been at the zoo since 2000 and because of her age, was perceived to not be able to birth a cub, but she pulled through. Also, female pandas are only able to conceive children 24 to 72 hours per year, making timing of inseminating Mei Xiang extremely crucial. The Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI) used the frozen semen from 22-year-old Tian Tian, the male giant Panda at the zoo. The cub is the size of a stick of butter, about 1\/900 of the mother\u2019s size. Pandas are icons of conservation movements for animals. For a long time, the panda species was classified as \u201Cendangered\u201D by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, due to many animal protection awareness and action, there was a 17% increase in the panda population over the past decade, moving the pandas from \u201Cendangered\u201D to \u201Cvulnerable\u201D. Presently, there are about 1,800 wild pandas with around 500 held in captivity. (@aidan.mathews ) \n-\n-\n-\nHave an idea?

The case suggests that some patients who recover from Covid-19 may only have short-lived immunity from the virus. Although it\u2019s too soon to draw any firm conclusions, the finding will be significant for those scrambling to make a vaccine using antibodies from recovered coronavirus patients. Shortly after the study was released, Yale University professor of immunobiology Akiko Iwasaki tweeted that \u201Cthis is no cause for alarm - this is a textbook example of how immunity should work.\u201D According to a study done by the University of Hong Kong, the patient tested positive on August 15 and was hospitalized but remains asymptomatic.

What will you say or do for a 6 year old child who says she doesn\u2019t really like school work? How does your school teachers handle different learners?\n\nThe pandemic came with a lot of heart breaking events. I mean, a lot of people lost their lives to the virus. On the flip side it afforded a lot of families to stay closely knitted. Something a lot of homes have not done in a long time. What would have made the kids stopped going to school and dad and mum stay home all the time without even going to the church or mosque, it has to be something really serious, something like covid 19.\n\nOne of the things staying at home did for me was to understand my children better like I said earlier. I must say that some parents finally had an idea of what the school was teaching, how their children react to school work and their children\u2019s strength and weakness.\n\nMy husband was supervising our daughter Pemi while I worked with Nimi. He told me that Pemi said she didn\u2019t like school work. In fact she wasn\u2019t interested\u2026.i smiled because I was not surprised. Staying with her during the lock down had afforded me the opportunity to see her at play and at study regularly.\n\nWhen it comes to science experiments, my daughter is an eager and impressive student. She would ensure she performs the experiment to the latter. Oh! You can literarily see the excitement on her face and she treats it like she is doing something really important.\n\nI remember when Pemi and Nimi were watching junior church on TV, Pemi was not really paying attention until the teacher gave an assignment that involved an activity.\n\nAs soon as the class was over, she ran to the kitchen, took a cup and she proceeded to do her assignment.  The teacher had taught them about the fruits of the spirit. She asked them to write the different fruits of the spirit on a paper, colour and paste on their cups with glue.\n\nI remember another day she woke up in the morning and told everyone who cared to listen that she wanted to organise a party. She made a list of what she wanted to do.

That\u2019s why it\u2019s helpful to work on our mindsets at a time like this and transform them into positive ones.✨\n.\nYour negative mindsets don\u2019t have to stick around and continue to limit your life. Instead, you can challenge them and transform them into positive mindsets. Specifically, by refusing to give negative mindsets attention and energy, you can weaken their grip on you and push them out of your mind. You can then replace these negative, limiting mindsets with positive mindsets which will serve you tremendously both in the present moment and your future self.\n. \nThis is great opportunity for those of you who now have more time at home to work on yourself. You have the opportunity to really work on rewiring those negative beliefs that you might have had for years. It takes 21 days to create a habit, so why not consciously and responsibly use the extra time that you now have at your disposal to work on mastering your mindset?\n.\nHow do you do this?

As famílias envolvidas no manejo das abelhas sem ferrão estão recebendo apoio técnico do projeto Floresta Ativa, uma iniciativa da ONG Projeto Saúde e Alegria.\n\nNo período de 18 a 20 de agosto, técnicos do Floresta Ativa fizeram uma viagem para diagnóstico da cadeia da meliponicultura na várzea. Foram visitadas famílias das comunidades Nova Vista, São José, Pixuna no Tapará, Tapará Mirim e Santa Maria do Tapará que praticam a meliponicultura. \n\nA intenção do PSA, segundo o técnico Alexandre Godinho é identificar com o mapeamento quais precisam de apoio em capacitação, kits de manejadores, e formação em práticas de manipulação e higiene.\n\n\u201CSerão apoiadas 100 famílias na várzea com aproximadamente mil enxames de abelhas sem ferrão. Por meio do resultado do diagnóstico produtivo será definida estratégia de produção na região\u201D, disse Godinho.\n\nA cadeia da meliponicultura compreende desde o uso de técnicas sustentáveis de bom manejo de abelhas sem ferrão para a produção do mel e seus derivados, como o pólen e o própolis, até o beneficiamento do produto e sua comercialização.\n\nSegundo o extensionista rural, Márcio Roberto que acompanhou a equipe nas comunidades do Ituqui e Tapará, o diagnóstico é fundamental para traçar medidas assertivas para uma produção de sucesso. \n\n\u201CO objetivo é apoiar a cadeia do mel para que ela se consolide e gere renda para as famílias que serão assistidas pelo PSA. Fazer um planejamento das ações com objetivo de melhorar a produção para que o pequeno produtor possa entregar um produto de qualidade ao mercado\u201D.\n \nLink na bio.\n\nFonte: G1\n\n#covid19 #coronavirus #ONN #onovonormal #ONNpoliticapublica #covidart #covid2020, #covid19brasil #covidmask #covidphotodiaries #covidnews #covid19art #corona #coronavírus #coronavirusbrazil #coronaviruspandemic #coronavirusoutbreak #coronavirus2020 #pandemic #pandemicart #pandemic2020, #pandemicorona #pandemiclife #fiqueemcasa #futuro #reuniaoonline #homeoffice #trabalhandoemcasa #emcasa","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#coronavirus","#ONN","#onovonormal","#ONNpoliticapublica","#covidart","#covid2020,","#covid19brasil","#covidmask","#covidphotodiaries","#covidnews","#covid19art","#corona","#coronavírus","#coronavirusbrazil","#coronaviruspandemic","#coronavirusoutbreak","#coronavirus2020","#pandemic","#pandemicart","#pandemic2020,","#pandemicorona","#pandemiclife","#fiqueemcasa","#futuro","#reuniaoonline","#homeoffice","#trabalhandoemcasa","#emcasa"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by O Novo Normal in Santarém, Brazil.

His was understood by those who spoke the language spoken, not tongues of babble.\n\nNew Age\/Hindu\/Buddhism teachings mixed with yoga (which activates the kundalini) are now being welcomed into churches. Started back in 1990's with welcoming these doctrines in churches.\n\nLakewood and Benny Hinn are two houses for Satan to propagate this nonsense. \"Legacy\" chant is used in churches that allows 99% holy spirit mimic. 1% devil is all it takes.\n\nBoth can bring visions, one brings God's visions with Christ as center and Kundalini brings visions of a *different* Christ or new beliefs or ideas of evolving ones mental ability to become godlike or a merging with the divine.\n\nKundalini leads to manifestations that are either really good or really ugly, still the word is not center. And the spirit will lead the person very far from the Word that is True 🔥🔥🔥","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @exposing_the_sheeple on August 24, 2020.

Ninety percent of Democrats and 67% of independents said the death toll was \"unacceptable.\" \nRepublicans were also more likely to believe the official death toll is inflated \u2013 though public health officials like Dr. Anthony Fauci have said the actual number of deaths from the virus is likely higher. Forty percent of registered Republicans believe the number of deaths is lower than reported, while 18% said it was probably about right and another 18% said the actual number of deaths was likely higher than reported. Overall, 44% of voters said the number of deaths was actually higher, 36% said it was lower and 20% said the reported number is likely correct. \n\nWhen asked their opinion of how President Donald Trump has managed the response to the pandemic, 42% of overall voters said Trump has done a good job. Among Republicans, the number saying the president has done a good job jumped to 86%, while 92% of Democrats said he has performed badly. Forty-four percent of independents said the president has done a good job with the outbreak and 56% said he hasn't. \n\nWhen asked about the survey Sunday on CBS News' \"Face the Nation,\" and why there was such a discrepancy between how Republicans other voters view the pandemic, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said it was \"a really unfair poll. Republicans do not want to see people suffering from this pandemic. We have all been affected by this. This is not a Republican or Democrat issue,\" McDaniel said. \n\nIn the presidential race, 52% of likely voters said they would vote for Democratic nominee Joe Biden and 42% said they would vote to reelect Trump.\nThose voters indicated little was likely to change their position between now and Nov. 3. \n(USA Today)","NumberOfLikes":2,"Hashtags":["#coronavirus","#pandemic","#government's","#response"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by NEWS The Headliner on August 24, 2020.

If you need help with anything technical, reach out to family and friends. We are all in this together. I saw someone on my FB offer services to help parents with their kids remote learning...this is the type of energy we need in 2020.\n \nTogether. Leaving no one behind. No matter the situation, kids from all walks of life and backgrounds must be given the same opportunities and attention.  This is America. We have the resources even while in the midst of a pandemic to ensure this happens, and we must make sure it happens. Elected officials need to put aside their partisan differences and get this right, for our children, for our country. \n \nAs I navigate through the classes with my 6 year old, I\u2019m thinking of all the parents who maybe don\u2019t have English as a first language, those who are not computer literate, those who have to work full time outside of the home, those who are in single parent households, those who have newborns or elderly parents to care for\u2026.\n \nThe list goes on and on, we all have so many different and unique circumstances but one thing is for sure.
