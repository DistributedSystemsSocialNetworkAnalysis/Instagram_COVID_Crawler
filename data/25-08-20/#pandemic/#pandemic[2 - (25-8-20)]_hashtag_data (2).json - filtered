This COVID-19 pandemic has given many of us a chance to sit at home and retrospect about our lives. Some of us have been able to realize the privileges that we hold, while many others got to realize where they are placed in this divided society. As individuals who pursue Social Work, what shook us more is the plight of children who belong to the families of migrant labourers. At a tender age, when their peers get the opportunity to stay home, safe and happy, spending quality time with their parents; these children had to walk under the scorching heat for miles, sometimes even barefoot. \nThrough a collaboration of dance and music, we have made a humble attempt to depict this divide among the children in our society. We have chosen some portions of two Malayalam (regional language of Kerala) songs from the movie 'Makalkku' (To a daughter), the music of which is composed by Pandit Ramesh Narayan and lyrics penned by Sri Kaithapram Damodaran Namboothiri. The first song 'Chanjaadi Aadi' has been sung by Mr Adnan Sami and Ms Gayathri Ashokan (female version) and the second song 'Mukilin Makale' has been sung by Ms Manjari Babu.\n\n#music #children #pandemic #migrants","NumberOfLikes":16,"Hashtags":["#visualentry","#learninginacovid19world","#music","#children","#pandemic","#migrants"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598338840,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 09:00:40 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Post-pandemic stickers üëÄ.

We\u2019re also recognizing about the deep rifts in our culture that separate the rich from the poor. A history of systemic racism is surfacing.

I\u2019m praying and asking God what He would have me do. I sense something bigger on the horizon\u2026\n\nIn the meantime, please help me make life a bit easier for these little ones. They need food and clothing. They are in desperate need of school supplies. Knowing that we can help these precious children is what helps me get through the day.\n\nWe need dozens of our friends and partners to help us with monthly support. We need people to join us by giving $20 or $40 a month, or whatever you can do. Remember this, one 25KG bag of rice is only $20 and can feed every child in the orphanage for a week. Pray about what you feel God is leading you to do and know that you are not just changing lives, but you are saving lives.\n\nWe have been able to do so much because of your support. I know this is just the beginning. Something significant is coming\u2026\n\nCall us today to become a monthly partner: 1-877-274-1970 to give via credit card\nYou can also setup a monthly eTransfer and send it to: give@hopeforliberia.com\n\nYour love and support for these children is a direct fulfillment of God\u2019s heart:\n\n\u201CWhoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me.\u201D Mark 9:37\n\nNOT A CHARITY...JUST PEOPLE HELPING PEOPLE\n\n1st Photo: With the children on August 13\n2nd Photo: The current school structure at the orphanage\n\n#Liberia #WestAfrica #Africa #HopeForLiberia #HumanitarianAid #PovertyRelief #FoodSecurity #WaterForLife #LivingWater #Widows #Orphans #Well #Rice #COVID19 #Pandemic #Crisis #Clothing #ChickenCoop #Update #ChickenPastor","NumberOfLikes":33,"Hashtags":["#Liberia","#WestAfrica","#Africa","#HopeForLiberia","#HumanitarianAid","#PovertyRelief","#FoodSecurity","#WaterForLife","#LivingWater","#Widows","#Orphans","#Well","#Rice","#COVID19","#Pandemic","#Crisis","#Clothing","#ChickenCoop","#Update","#ChickenPastor"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598360654,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 15:04:14 CEST 2020","Location":"Johnsonville, Montserrado, Liberia"},{"CaptionText":"Just an Emotional Support Animal doing his job... #emotionalsupportanimal #emotionalhealth #mentalhealth #ptsd #panicanxietydisorder #anxiety #agoraphobia #disabledveteran #disabledusafveteran #pandemic #whorescuedwho #bennie #bennieboo #fosterfail #fosterfailure #mycat #catmom #catmomaf #abandonedcats #feralcolonycats #feralcolonycaretaker #feralcatcolonycaretaker #catsofinstagram #catsofig #catsofinsta #trapneuterreturn #trapneuterrelease #tnr #quarantinecats #quarantinecatsofinstagram","NumberOfLikes":12,"Hashtags":["#emotionalsupportanimal","#emotionalhealth","#mentalhealth","#ptsd","#panicanxietydisorder","#anxiety","#agoraphobia","#disabledveteran","#disabledusafveteran","#pandemic","#whorescuedwho","#bennie","#bennieboo","#fosterfail","#fosterfailure","#mycat","#catmom","#catmomaf","#abandonedcats","#feralcolonycats","#feralcolonycaretaker","#feralcatcolonycaretaker","#catsofinstagram","#catsofig","#catsofinsta","#trapneuterreturn","#trapneuterrelease","#tnr","#quarantinecats","#quarantinecatsofinstagram"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Lori Eve Simpson on August 25, 2020.

He then traveled to Spain & upon arrival back to Hong Kong on 8\/15 had a saliva test at the airport which was positive. The man was asymptomatic. \u2063\n\u2063\nScientists sequenced out his strain and were able to prove that he was in fact infected with 2 different strains, providing evidence of reinfection. He developed detectable levels of antibody after the second infection. \u2063\n\u2063\nThe man however remained asymptomatic which signals that the immune system had likely recruited & activated its cells to mount the antibody response which prevented him from developing the disease. This is how the immune system works classically.\u2063\n\u2063\nWith over 23 million cases worldwide, this appears to be the first proven case of reinfection. So what does that mean? \u2063\n\u2063\nWell out of 23 million cases this is the first proven one, so it's still rather rare. However there is a good chance there may be other cases out there which just have not yet been proven by viral sequencing. But also a few other important take away points. \u2063\n\u2063\nFirst we can see by this example that the immune response is the way it is supposed to be, stronger with repeated exposure. (However we don't know if this will be the case in all individuals,  time will tell) . \u2063\n\u2063\nSecond and most importantly,  a person previously infected who can be re-exposed & have active virus detected is also then able to transmit the virus. This means the 3 W's  Wear a mask, Watch your distance & Wash your hands are even more crucial until long term herd immunity with vaccination is achieved. \u2063\n\u2063\n#sarscov2 #covid19 #pandemic #reinfection #infectiousdisease #outbreak #contagion #cdc #who #hongkong #spain #globalhealth #epidemiology #science #virus #transmission #coronavirus #corona #rona","NumberOfLikes":89,"Hashtags":["#sarscov2","#covid19","#pandemic","#reinfection","#infectiousdisease","#outbreak","#contagion","#cdc","#who","#hongkong","#spain","#globalhealth","#epidemiology","#science","#virus","#transmission","#coronavirus","#corona","#rona"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1598360420,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 15:00:20 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Title : I WOULD LIKE TO WEAR A MASK \nMedium : Drawing Ink \nVisual : Side view of Person wearing mask \n\nYou don\u2019t have to like\/comment\/share this post, just please : WEAR THE DAMN MASK ABOVE THE NOSE \n(Splatters of ink is symbolic of the virus all around us)\n\nMark Titchner\u2019s instructions : Same as the previous post \n\n.\n.\n.\n#globalissues #coronavirus #Covid19 #pandemic #illustration #drawingink #doodle #logoinspiration #inkart #marktitchner #sketchbook #art #artistsoninstagram #maskart #maskon #unitednations #healthforall","NumberOfLikes":110,"Hashtags":["#globalissues","#coronavirus","#Covid19","#pandemic","#illustration","#drawingink","#doodle","#logoinspiration","#inkart","#marktitchner","#sketchbook","#art","#artistsoninstagram","#maskart","#maskon","#unitednations","#healthforall"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Sarah Sobti on August 25, 2020 tagging @who, and @ecocentrik.","NumberOfComments":8,"Timestamp":1598360417,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 15:00:17 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Welcome Freshmen  #university #columbiauniversity #mask #pandemic #covid #highereducation #degree #firstday #manhattan #nyc #a7iii #sonyalpha  #lightroom #platinum","NumberOfLikes":13,"Hashtags":["#university","#columbiauniversity","#mask","#pandemic","#covid","#highereducation","#degree","#firstday","#manhattan","#nyc","#a7iii","#sonyalpha","#lightroom","#platinum"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Kyle Martin Photography in Columbia University.

After six years of infertility issues nov 2019 thru c sec delivered my pinkies...before deliverry i know 6 months ebf is must. But after my c sec ,after some hours ward staff came and latched my babies..they latched well .and hospital staff  got sign from my hus telling that i am not producing milk. My hus didnt sign by reading the terms. They told babies are hungry , plz sign .on third day i wnt for pumping as gynac suggested.i didnt get a drop because the nurse didnt fix the oump properly but my breast was in heavy engorgement. Mean while i tried to latch my cuties they didnt because my nipple was hard and big due to engorgement. Finally came home and sttled in formula and post partum depression. Mean while met an lc also she charged 700 rs for an hour consultation. Its  too high for an middle class family. Only one tip for one cosultation lost full hope after 2 months suddenly met Hannah Grace onÃÉline ..wow such a kind hearted friend she gave me confident and suddenly my second girl rejected bottle. Hannah told its good try bf.two day s she was cluster feeding as demand icreases my supply got increased. as HanÃÉnah told to bf my first girl also .two three days it was tough after that it became routine.....yeahüòçüòçüòçüòçi started to breastfeed my two girls.now giving only one time formula only 75 ml each.Hannah gave tip to pump milk instead...trying for that.. Thank you Hannah....many times i used to watsapp her call her she used to motivate me always .. One tip .,Dont lose hope try  bfing for half day slowly increase to full day..

All those curfews on our time and limitations on what we could get into. So many doors were shut to us.\n.\nOn a bad day we\u2019d constantly mumble about how life sucks. On a good day we\u2019d figure out something simple and maybe kinda weird, but it would usually turn out great as long as the company was good.\n.\nNot having a car would turn into existential conversations on curbsides. Having nowhere to go became chats atop picnic tables in flooded park waters. Having no money turned into laughter over nothing but a McDonalds coke at 4pm. \n.\nIt was an age of frustration that sometimes broke through to cool. If we\u2019d imagine a little.\n.\nAdults stink at that. We\u2019re organized and rigid. We can go anywhere or do anything but we leave silly and delight off the agenda. We\u2019re lost without our favorites and specificities.\n.\nI\u2019ll tell you, I hate all the versions of this lockdown (with lots of words bleeped out). I feel like a freaking 17 yr old again. I\u2019m bored. I\u2019m mad at my authorities. I\u2019m ready to break some rules and sneak out.\n.\nThis sunken teenage depression in me keeps muttering about what sucks and wants to see who else thinks it sucks.

We\u2019ve played in landscaping sprinklers. Found new nature. Followed wild bunnies. Run through bubbles in the city. Snuck onto playgrounds. Brought take-out all. over. the. damn. nation.\n.\nEvery time we did something off the wanted-agenda my joy went deeper. Every time we laughed at life my lungs expanded. \n. \nEverything is weird and sucky and I\u2019m tired of being told what to do.

Yesterday, while doing a press conference, Mr. Bolsonaro was asked a question by a reporter about corruption within his family. Specifically, there were some payments made to his wife\u2019s bank account that are in question since they were deposited by a former aid, possibly hinting to some agenda or bribery. In response, Bolsonaro said this: \u201CI want to punch you in the face, OK?\u201D It is clear that being asked questions like that are becoming a large annoyance for President Bolsonaro, as it is likely that answering them are becoming a daily part of his routine. It is important to note that these rumors being true or not is up for debate. According to most local sources, the approval rating of Bolsonaro has gone up a lot. Many suspect this is due to the financial relief that has been provided by Brasilia, while others argue that many just approve of the pandemic response. \nWhat do you think?\nDo you agree with Bolsonaro\u2019s decision to snap at the reporter?\nDo you think the corruption scandals against Bolsonaro are true?\nLet us know in the comments belowüëá\n\n#bolsonaro #brazil #brasilia #rio #coronavirus #media #virus #pandemic #lockdown #geopolitics #power #control #fear #activism #republican #democrat #debate #insight #updates #information #igdaily #post #government #stories #uptodate #needtoknow #modern #news #politics #politics1001\n\nPhoto from: Khaleej Times\n\nNews sources: CNN, Fox News, The Guardian, Reuters, Latestly","NumberOfLikes":266,"Hashtags":["#bolsonaro","#brazil","#brasilia","#rio","#coronavirus","#media","#virus","#pandemic","#lockdown","#geopolitics","#power","#control","#fear","#activism","#republican","#democrat","#debate","#insight","#updates","#information","#igdaily","#post","#government","#stories","#uptodate","#needtoknow","#modern","#news","#politics","#politics1001"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Politics1001 on August 25, 2020.

I usually travel all over the world at least once in a month, and it\u2019s been a while, a long while.\n\nSo I just sat and looked around my messy room and tried to sleep again without success to continue my cut dream about traveling.

But after 6 months lockdown or social distancing where we have to stay at home, it didn\u2019t happen, look at this, my room still looks like a ground zero area after the earthquake, so I have to admit that it\u2019s not because of lacking the time at all.

Those would be great questions for one of our local news media orgs to explore @cbcns @ctvatlantic @capebretonpost. This behavior is particularly sickening in Cape Breton where so many people, through no fault of their own, are forced to move to other provinces (and countries) to find jobs, and then they return to their families in CB and are confronted by the likes of this. The Atlantic provinces have enjoyed the luxury of pursuing a novel coronavirus extirpation policy even as Canada\u2019s workhorse provinces have had no choice but to continue putting their own residents at risk in order to keep essential goods and services flowing, so that all Canadians can have food on their tables and gasoline in their tanks, including these proprietors of Rocky Bay Cottages in Ingonish NS (swipe to see the wider-angle pic of their exclusion sign in context).

Today, each one of us is facing a challenge that we could never have anticipated. Some days are harder than others, and it\u2019s important to try and focus on any positives, rather than revel in the negatives.\n\nThe Black Dog Institute recommends the following 7 ways to help manage COVID-19 blues:\n\n1. Recognise your feelings and rate it on a scale of 1-10. Speak to someone about your feelings. \n\n2. Often stop and release any tension you are holding in your body.\n\n3. Track your sleep, are you getting enough? What is the quality of your sleep? Develop ways to shut off your mind and improve your sleep.\n\n4. Try not to focus on \u201Cwhat if\u201D scenarios. Take notice of when you are thinking in a negative way and ask yourself \u201Cis there a positive side to this situation?\u201D\n\n5. Recognise your reactions to people and scenarios, are you behaving out of the ordinary\/ snapping at people? Take a moment to reflect.\n\n6. Have a check in buddy, someone you trust and feel comfortable talking to.\n\n7. Exercise for at least an hour a day. Exercise is proven to reduce depression and anxiety by getting those positive endorphins flowing through the body.\n\nRemember we are all in this together. If you are feeling as though you aren\u2019t coping with Covid-19, please seek professional help and call Lifeline on 13 11 14 or emergency.\n\nFor more information, head over the the Black Dog Institution website.\n\nPic: @smithhousephoto","NumberOfLikes":7,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by swardLaw in Shellharbour, New South Wales with @wollongongbusinesses, @shellharbourvillage, @women_in_law_and_business, @theillawarraplug, @illawarrabusinesscommunity, and @illawarrabusinesses.

The Trump administration said they are looking to fast-track vaccines and treatments for the coronavirus - the S&P 500 reached record highs, closing above the 3,400 level, on the back of this news as bonds fell. However, there remains a wide disconnect within the markets themselves. The FT reported that the average S&P 500 stock is down 28.4% compared to its 52-week high. In fact, one-fifth of the stocks in the US Index are down over 50% from their all-time-highs. It is safe to say that the rallying market and all time highs are clouding the reality amidst the celebrations. Nonetheless, further to the White House annoucement, the Food and Drug Administration, over the weekend, said that it is working to expand access to a virus treatment involving blood plasma from recovered patients. \u2063\n\u2063\nüõ¢A big story brewing in the crude oil market relates to the two storms, Marco and Laura, which are rolling towards the US Gulf Coast. They are expected to come ashore as soon as Monday. This is the first time two hurricanes are heading into the same direction, which can have devastating impacts, not just on livelihoods but an already battered crude oil market. Almost 82% of the oil production in the US Gulf of Mexico has been shut down as a threat prompted evacuations of off-shore energy platforms and set residents and officials on edge from Texas to Florida. Oil and gasoline prices rallied on potential disruption in supply.","NumberOfLikes":16,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598345199,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 10:46:39 CEST 2020","Location":"London, United Kingdom"},{"CaptionText":"üò¥\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#dog #dogsofinstagram #doglife #doglovers #dogstagram #dogoftheday #love #life #pandemic #photography #lifestyle #doggo #instadog#2020 #lockdown #lockdownlife #memes #dogg#memories #throwback#goldenretriever #goldendoodlesofinstagram#foryou","NumberOfLikes":20,"Hashtags":["#dog","#dogsofinstagram","#doglife","#doglovers","#dogstagram","#dogoftheday","#love","#life","#pandemic","#photography","#lifestyle","#doggo","#instado","#2020","#lockdown","#lockdownlife","#memes","#dog","#memories","#throwbac","#goldenretriever","#goldendoodlesofinstagra","#foryou"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Simbaüíõ on August 25, 2020.

Originally from Sri Lanka and this is just my 2nd year of working in the NHS and the last few months have made me realise how much I love my job and the NHS. I was working in a Geriatric ward when the Pandemic hit. Our ward changed overnight into an elderly COVID-19 ward and a COVID-19 rehab unit for patients coming out of ICU. So our ward was the last ward patients were in before going home and it was absolutely lovely to be part of their rehab journey. They would come out of ICU completely deconditioned unable to get up, move or even eat on their own. Watching them progress with physiotherapy and engaging in group exercise classes would just make my day. However it hasn't been all sunshine and rainbows; I have had my fair share of breaking bad news to families or just facetiming families when their loved one is on the death bed and they cannot visit.\nThe one patient I will always remember was a 95 year old gentleman who had lived through the second World War and later was a part of the British Army. He was COVID-19 positive and just as I was leaving at the end of my long day shift started to cough out blood - must have been atleast a litre of blood before we could stabilise him. I did not expect him to live but the next day I come in and I hear he had told the night team he wasn't ready to go just yet. He was discharged home perfectly fine 2 weeks later.\u2019\u2022\n\u2022\n#doctor #doctorsofinstagram #nhs #nhsdoctors #nhsteam #nhsheroes #health #healthcare #medicine #pandemic #recovery #miracle #positivity #positivevibes #scrubs #scrublife #rehab #rehabilitation #goinghome #britisharmy #british","NumberOfLikes":124,"Hashtags":["#doctor","#doctorsofinstagram","#nhs","#nhsdoctors","#nhsteam","#nhsheroes","#health","#healthcare","#medicine","#pandemic","#recovery","#miracle","#positivity","#positivevibes","#scrubs","#scrublife","#rehab","#rehabilitation","#goinghome","#britisharmy","#british"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Doctor Positivity on August 25, 2020 tagging @madi_afeez.

It has been tried since early in the year in China, the Netherlands, and also in the US, where more than 70,000 patients have received it already as part of studies or under case-by-case medical exemptions, according to the US Food and Drug Administration. However, some doctors have criticized how the treatment has been handled in the US. Because doctors have been allowed to give plasma to tens of thousands of patients outside of trials, they say, it\u2019s been difficult to gather decisive evidence on the effects.\n\nThe approval of the use of plasma also comes days after President Trump took to Twitter to accuse the FDA and the \u201Cdeep state, or whoever\u201D of slow-walking cures in order to interfere with his chances in the November general election.\n\nThe plasma approval could foreshadow US government actions around a vaccine for covid-19, some scientists fear. The chief doctor coordinating vaccine studies in the US has said data supporting a vaccine won\u2019t be in hand until January at the earliest, but the Financial Times reported that the administration is looking to fast-track an emergency approval of a vaccine before Election Day. If an unsafe or ineffective vaccine goes into wide use, that will be a bigger setback than we\u2019ll suffer if convalescent plasma proves a dud. That is because plasma is given to people who are already sick, while vaccines are given to healthy people. Click the link in our bio to learn more.

It will flow and flourish when the artist starts thinking beyond normal. World came to a standstill 6 months ago due to virus pandemic, no venturing out, no gathering, & certainly no shooting. In this time, Voot Select comes up with an experimental 4 parts series, \u2018The Gone Game\u2019. The series is entirely shot at actors\u2019 house with minimum crew and equipment, in few cases just the phone. Directed by #nikhilnageshbhatt , the series is about life of an family entangled due to pandemic lockdown - Sahil Gujral (Arjun Mathur) a Covid victim, his wife Suhani (Shriya Pilgaonkar) a social media influencer, his father (Sanjay Kapoor) a dodgy businessman, his curious sister Amara (Shweta Tripathi) & few more. The story starts when Sahil is taken to the hospital for treatment and is declared dead after few days, however an unintended phone call makes Amara & the rest of the family wonder if Sahil is still alive. Suspicion grows for a while and then Gujral family confronts the unpleasant truth at the end, leaving the trail for season 2. \n\nThe series hosts an impressive line of actors, knit together by good #direction. Having shot on real locations and minimum equipment gives a sense of pure drama and emotions while going through #pandemic. Having shot entirely indoors also added to the frustration due to claustrophobic setting. The #screenplay is crisp & hardly leaves any gap to fill. The groovy background score added the punch where the script starts getting loose. The camera work & the dramatic lighting, though in most case actors\u2019 own effort, is equivalent (if not better) to the professional, thanks to the endeavour from Piyush Puty, the #cinematographer. \n\nApart from the family #drama, the series on one hand highlights the social aloofness due to digital proximities, but on other hand it shows technology as a helping hand in the state of crisis, which make sense for an interesting debate. Overall, an interesting & must watch series!\n\n#thegonegame #vootselect #webseries #thriller #review  #critic #screenplay #covid #lockdown","NumberOfLikes":10,"Hashtags":["#nikhilnageshbhatt","#direction.","#pandemic.","#screenplay","#cinematographer.","#drama,","#thegonegame","#vootselect","#webseries","#thriller","#review","#critic","#screenplay","#covid","#lockdown"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Vipul M on August 24, 2020 tagging @djspersis, @shriya.pilgaonkar, @arjun__mathur, @rukhsarrehman, @piyushputy, @battatawada, @nayantaramusic, @ferzadpalia, @anupnvkadam, @bhummika93, @adityan28, @indraneilsengupta, @nix_bhat, @voot, @mautiktolia, @sanjaykapoor2500, @lubnamsalim, @dibyenduofficial, @vootselect, and @bodhitreemultimedia.

It's early days but I'm brainstorming something pretty exciting so watch this space.\n\nWe loved our trip the south coast whilst our kitchen was being renovated, I kinda wished I was still there though.

Despite all the controversy and polarized reviews, this is a great game. It\u2019s an ambitious flawed masterpiece with plenty of feels. It features a lot of LGBT characters and relationships and does a good job at showing the stigma that LGBT people face in everyday life. The game also shows how someone deals with a trauma, and how it can send a sane person down a dark path of revenge, hatred and destruction, and how this can change a person's mental state. The game also takes a look at society as a whole and makes commentary on our own by showing how the post-pandemic society in the game is living in separate divided factions of people. It shows the story from all sides and shows how all of these different people that are at war with each other are all forced to do terrible things to survive, and that none of them are really any better than each other, and they even have more alike than they all believe. It's a complex game and I feel like some people either missed out on the depth behind the story, or they got too triggered for their own political reasons.

Kita cukup sampai di bibir pintu rumah sakit. \u201CYang lain gak boleh masuk. Cukup dua orang wae!\u201D kata Pak satpam. Capek-capek menggotong solider dan ramah tamah dari kampung, tau-taunya gak jadi tilik. \u201CTenane rapopo, emak-emak ojo dadi tilik?\u201D \n\nSalah satu film yang lagi viral akhir-akhir ini adalah film pendek berjudul \u201CTilik\u201D (Menjenguk). Film pendek berbahasa Jawa ini, diproduksi oleh Ravacana Films bekerja sama dengan Dinas Kebudayaan (Disbud) Provinsi Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta (DIY) pada tahun 2018. Meski dirilis pada bulan September 2018 lalu film ini justru baru masuk \u201Ctrending topic\u201D saat ini. Kira-kira kenapa? \n\nKekuataan film ini sejatinya ada pada rentetan dialog yang kental boso Jowo. Tak puas rasanya, jika adegan dalam film ini \u201Cdiskip\u201D begitu saja tanpa memperhatikan dengan jeli obrolan \u201Cnyinyir\u201D beberapa tokoh. Sosok yang ramai dibicarakan adalah Bu Tejo yang diperankan \u201Call out\u201D oleh Siti Fauziah. Sosok Bu Tejo sejatinya mewakili keaslian dinamika obrolan sehari-hari ibu-ibu \u201Cndeso.\u201D Khas dan dekat. Inilah dimensi persuasif yang justru menyedot perhatian publik.\n\nYang suka \u201Cnyinyir\u201D sebetulnya enak diajak jalan-jalan. Perjalanan yang ditempuh jarak berkilo-kilo, agaknya tak terasa jika ditemanin orang-orang, seperti Bu Tejo. Konten ceritanyaya pasti \u201Cora pedot-pedot\u201D dan gado-gado. Justru di sinilah letak intens dan \u201Cterenyuhnya\u201D cuplikan film \u201CTilik.\u201D Kita diserempet dialek khas Jowo plus medhok DIY. Ramah ditelinga, tapi kadang bikin geram gara-gara obrolan nyeleneh Bu Tejo.\n\nUlasan selengkapnya dapat dibaca di akun facebook Cristianto Naqu.\n\n#tilik \n#viralpost\n#viralvideos\n#butejo #butejotilik #bestphotography\n#filmpendek \n#covid_19 #pandemic #viruscoronavirus","NumberOfLikes":14,"Hashtags":["#tilik","#viralpost","#viralvideos","#butejo","#butejotilik","#bestphotography","#filmpendek","#covid_19","#pandemic","#viruscoronavirus"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Cristianto Naqu in Special Region of Yogyakarta.
