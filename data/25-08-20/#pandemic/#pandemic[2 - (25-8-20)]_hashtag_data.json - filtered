Egan is a surfer, skier, environmental activist, and an alum of the industrial and systems engineering program. She\u2019s also the cofounder and CEO of ecomedes, a company that helps the commercial-building product industry reduce costs and impact through optimized product purchasing. In this episode, she talks about her journey to becoming a CEO, about learning to ask for what she wanted, becoming her authentic self (and finally dropping all the football talk), and how she counters the imposter syndrome that, incredibly, still haunts her. She offers advice for students on how to make the impressions that can give them an edge as they start their careers. And finally, she explains how she found her calling in the business of sustainability, and why she has hope that humanity can act in time to address climate change.

Probably not, and one of my reasons for loving wine.\nThough wine is an ephemeral thing (I love that word), the truly good wines do last, on our palates and in our memories. This was one of those wines.\nAlso, it's no secret that I believe a bottle of wine is your passport to see the world and in no other time has this resonated more. Our passports may be locked up but our wines do not have to be.\n\nHere's my theory: When times are good, people drink wine. When times are bad, people drink wine. My question to you is, during this very new experience called COVID-19, which camp do you fall into?: \n1) Buy less expensive wines in bulk because, well, pandemic, OR 2) Buy higher priced wines and empty your cellars because, well, pandemic?\n\nI proudly do both and this bottle is most certainly in the #2 category. I stared at it longingly for months during lock-down. What would finally bring me to open it? How about any day that ends in \"Y\", that's what. This bottle was a gift from a friend, so it had even extra meaning.\n\nThis @labraccescawines Syrah hails from Cortona, a wine growing region in Italy (eastern Tuscany to be exact). It sits about an hour and a half south and east of Florence for all you world travelers out there (remember traveling? Sigh.). Syrah really shines here and this wine exceeded my expectations. It had layers and layers to it and the longer it was open, the more it shone. Picture a bowl of stewed black and red berries with drizzled dark chocolate on top with a few crumbles of bacon-- that's this wine. Well integrated tannins and good acidity gave it a great \"finish\"...I was still tasting it almost forty five seconds after swallowing it. I have always had a love affair with Syrah but this was my first from this region. As usual, well played, Italy.\n\nI hope this time finds you cooking all the meals and drinking all the wine. Even though we cannot physically travel, these two things can take us somewhere else altogether.\n\n#syrah #cortona #labraccesca #italy #tuscany #covid19 #pandemic #wine #wineeducator #winesavvynyc","NumberOfLikes":20,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":10,"Timestamp":1598285589,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 24 18:13:09 CEST 2020","Location":"Cortona, Tuscany"},{"CaptionText":"Believed to be ground zero for the COVID-19 pandemic, the city of Wuhan was partially reopened following a lockdown that lasted over 60 days.

The hardworking and dedicate team at the EAAA needed to remain fully operational despite the risks involved with working during this time. To do so, they had to use substantial masking to protect themselves when in close contact with patients which in turn limited their verbal communication. \n\nThe solution required was a VOX operated throat mic system that allowed the team to communicate hands free whilst in action.  This was not readily available on the market, so Comms-spec had to bespoke make the VOX operated throat mics themselves out of various audio accessories in house. These were then combined with a set of small portable handheld radios, programmed as per the customers needs and sent to the team air ambulance team. \n\nHere is what the EAAA had to say:\u201CWe would like to express our heartfelt thanks to Communications Specialist Ltd for their support to our front-line crew during the Covid-19 pandemic.

EXPECTATIONS. Whether it be for a certain job, beach body, relationships, family, financial stability, the American dream or what I now tell my clients the \"pandemic hustle.\" 😏 This is what knocks down the human experience that creates more anxiety and depression that we don't discuss enough. I am blessed to have a career where I am trusted with people's vulnerability coming from all backgrounds and walks of life. We have built these false standards in our ethnic culture and society that tells us how we need to live by a certain age. Now, I'm not saying that these things cannot be goals but how we perceive them is a problem. What I do believe everyone needs to truly realize is that the only thing worth living for are authentic CONNECTIONS. I've been fortunate in my 20s to build the best support system with genuine friends and family as a Spanish speaking gay, black man. I have an amazing career where I service the underserved, stuck and misguided as a psychotherapist. Lastly owning a dance studio with a committed business partner and authentic friendship is what makes our dance students and small business thrive. However none of this would be possible without my supports and faith. I challenge you to reflect on what is meaningful in this life and how satisfied you will begin to feel when we invest healthily in each other ❤ \n\n#thirtyandthriving #therapythought #pandemic #expectations #gay #lgbtq #black #mentalhealth #socialconnection #counseling #psychotherapy #psychology #azbda #latin #ballroomdance #spanish","NumberOfLikes":74,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Tee Jay on August 24, 2020.

The CDC outlines a multistep process that includes Exploratory, Pre-clinical, Clinical development, Regulatory review, approval, Manufacturing, and Quality control for vaccine development.\n.\n.\nClinical development happens in 3 stages. In Phase I, a small number of healthy people are vaccinated to test safety, dosage, and to confirm immune system activation. In Phase II, 100s of people are divided into groups (such as age and physical health) to see if the vaccine acts differently in them. In Phase III, thousands of people are given to ensure both efficacy and safety.\n.\n. \nAll vaccines work by teaching the body\u2019s immune system to recognize and neutralize them. The SARS-CoV-2 contains a unique spike protein essential to get inside human cells. The vaccine activates the immune system\u2019s T-helper cells. T-helper cells detect the virus and do two things, first, instructs B cells to create antibodies against the virus to neutralize, second, instruct the T-Killer cells to destroy infected cells.\n.\n.\nCurrently, there are different vaccines in phase 3 trials, developed by different research groups in collaboration with pharmaceutical companies at different parts of the world (Swipe to see table). Phase 3 clinical trials need to show that the vaccine is safe. Production of the vaccine on a huge scale must be developed, and finally, the vaccine has to be approved by the regulators.\n\nPS: The number of people in phase III trials are still being updated. This post reflects a static point in time. \n.\n.\nPost by: Abira Ganguly, PhD\nImage Source: Flickr","NumberOfLikes":87,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598282369,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 24 17:19:29 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-NCpBHewQoQ&feature=share \n\n#Comedy #Homeschool #Education #Teaching #Homeschooling #Students #covid19 #Pandemic","NumberOfLikes":1,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Ruth Perez on August 24, 2020.

De acordo com a pesquisa, pessoas com tipo A apresentaram um risco 45% maior de desenvolverem quadros mais graves. Em quem possuía o tipo O, o efeito foi contrário: queda de 35%. Esses são os tipos sanguíneos mais frequentes na população.\n⠀\nApesar de os pesquisadores terem identificado essa possível relação, isso não significa que todas as pessoas com tipo sanguíneo A terão sintomas mais graves e complicações, assim como não quer dizer que as pessoas de tipo O terão sempre sintomas leves. É uma doença muito nova e existem muitas variáveis e outros fatores de risco já amplamente identificados - diabetes e hipertensão, por exemplo.\n⠀\nO estudo foi publicado no periódico inglês The New England Journal of Medicine e analisou os genes de cerca de 4 mil pessoas com sinais graves, moderados ou leves da Covid-19, além de indivíduos livres da infecção.\n⠀\nFonte: @veja_saude \n\n#homenurseassessoria \n\n#covid #coronavirus #bhfyp #covid19 #corona #fashion #stayhome #likeforlikes #follow #pandemic #covid_19 #explore #nature #instagood #followforfollowback #salud #music #trending #life #instagram #travel #photooftheday #health #youtube #motivation #fun #explorepage #followme","NumberOfLikes":10,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Home Nurse Assessoria in Home Nurse Assessoria - Furo de orelha saudável e humanizado.

Por causa da pandemia do covid-19, a feira, que deveria ter sido aberta em abril, foi cancelada, provocando uma discussão entre associações que representam as galerias e a direção da SP-Arte pela devolução do dinheiro pago pelo aluguel dos espaços no pavilhão da Bienal. \n\nSegundo Fernanda Feitosa, a SP-Arte devolveu a integralidade dos pagamentos efetuados e diversas galerias, muitas delas expositoras desde a primeira edição e outras recentes, optaram por deixar o crédito para a edição de 2021.\n\nSe há menos galerias na edição virtual, que vai até o dia 30, a perda de alguns participantes foi compensada pela entrada de novos parceiros \u2013 aliás novíssimos, caso da HOA, galeria de arte paulistana fundada este ano pela artista Igi Lola Ayedun, dedicada à arte contemporânea latino-americana, que já usa a internet como ponto operacional. Igualmente criada por artistas e tendo como curadores brasileiros e africanos, a 01.01 Platform promove artistas emergentes com o apoio de instituições do Reino Unido, Portugal e Gana. \n\nTentando uma nova abordagem do mercado, ela propõe uma forma alternativa de colecionismo, que leve em conta a cultura produzida nos países da antiga rota comercial da escravidão.\n\nLink na bio.\n\nFonte: Estadão\n\n#covid19 #coronavirus #ONN #onovonormal #ONNpoliticapublica #covidart #covid2020, #covid19brasil #covidmask #covidphotodiaries #covidnews #covid19art #corona #coronavírus #coronavirusbrazil #coronaviruspandemic #coronavirusoutbreak #coronavirus2020 #pandemic #pandemicart #pandemic2020, #pandemicorona #pandemiclife #fiqueemcasa #futuro #reuniaoonline #homeoffice #trabalhandoemcasa #emcasa","NumberOfLikes":9,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by O Novo Normal in São Paulo, Brazil.

Many businesses are operating remotely, but many still need a physical office to work efficiently and\/or to conduct meetings. If before the virus spread many would choose a #coworking environment, nowadays employers and employees want more safety, and therefore less sharing. One of the best solutions can be getting a more spacious private affordable office in a well-maintained building. We can still offer you a great amount of flexibility in your deal, but at a better rate and in better conditions. We have #officespace as small as around 300 SF and as large as a full floor.

It is recommended by health professionals, to not wear a mask, when an individual is alone, or staying at a place without sick patients. Prolonged use of masks, can cause breathlessness, dizziness and can cause fainting in people who are prone to lung diseases. \n\nWhich?\n1. The Cloth Mask: It is recommended for use while going out to buy essentials.\n\n2. The HEPA Filter: They are not recommended to great extent, as the cloth mask's lower cost and reusability, overweighs the HEPA filter's added safety.\n\n3. The Surgical Mask: They are commonly to be used by those caring for sick people, frontline workers and health care workers. \n\n4. N95 Masks: They should only be used by doctors, or family members entering the room of confirmed COVID patients. \n\nHow?\nWe now know that the cloth masks can be washed with soap\/detergent, and dried in the sun, till completely dry, for reuse. The disposal mechanism for single use masks are different\n\nSurgical Masks: Once you wear the mask, do not pull it down, and then pull it up again. After you are done using the mask, slowly remove the mask, chin upwards, while not touching the skin. Be sure to cut the strings off, so that they wont be reused by others intentionally or unintentionally. Put it in a plastic cover and tie up the plastic cover as tightly as possible, and throw it in the Non-Biodegradable bin.\n\nN95 Masks: Similar to the Surgical mask, make sure you do not touch the inner portion of the N95 mask. Put it in a ziplock cover, or plastic cover. Seal it completely, and throw it in a Non-Biodegradable bin immediately after using it.\n\nDisposal openly in dustbins, throwing them in water bodies or on the ground will add to the problems. It is our responsibility to dispose the masks properly after use. About 4000 fishes have died due to masks being thrown into rivers and oceans. Let us put an end to this.\n\nLets take the pledge: I will wear it right, and dispose it right.\n\nCredits : @the_mod_function\nDigitised by @tv.amritha\n\n#covid19 #pandemic #socialdistancing #masks #prevention #safety #AUdaily","NumberOfLikes":115,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598278787,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 24 16:19:47 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Mai thi tum thi kaun tha??? \nYe rashi thi. \n. \n. \n. \nCerdits: @yashrajmukhate\n@shrivastava.nandita . \n. \n. \nA must watch. 🤣🤣\n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n#trending #viral #video #reshi #gopi #kokilamodi #cooker #chana #gas #juice #bath #sari #smile #justforfun #laugh #timepass #pandemic #quarantine #love #share #comment #starplus #saathnibhanasaathiya #ahem #jia #rupal #rucha #ten #followforfollowback #thankful .","NumberOfLikes":13,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by vintageuttergal🐾 on August 24, 2020 tagging @yashrajmukhate, and @shrivastava.nandita.

Given that our healthcare systems are being #challenged from the COVID-19 #pandemic we need to do our part to help reduce #healthcare facility #visits and admissions, easing the load. We need to allay the possibility of a \u201Ctwindemic,\u201D the overlap of #fluseason and an expected surge in COVID-19 cases this fall and winter.  #doctor #physician #nurse #hospital https:\/\/www.google.com\/amp\/s\/pressofatlanticcity.com\/news\/now-is-the-time-to-defend-against-influenza-get-a-flu-shot-dr-nina-radcliff\/article_fa87c715-5250-5c1a-af3b-2a010a096035.amp.html","NumberOfLikes":7,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Vincent Vlemx on August 24, 2020.

There are numerous other effective treatments out there which have been pointed out by many honest and brave doctors. \n\nAnd if you think these doctors are lying.. do you really think that they would be risking their entire careers, medical licenses and reputations just to deceive people? NO!! They are putting so much in the line in order to stand up for us and what it right! ❤️\n\nSo why are they trying to push an unsafe experimental vaccine into the global community - which the Australian government want to make mandatory?? Well, I think Dr. Madej will be able to give you somewhat of an understanding! (And yes, the Australian PM has retracted his statement about vaccines being mandatory- but think about the repercussions of choosing to not be vaccinated🤔) \n\nSTAND UP FOR WHAT IS RIGHT!!

Can\u2019t quite put your finger on what might be contributing to it?  You might be experiencing something called Crisis Fatigue.⠀\n.⠀\n🌿 This occurs when stress from one or more crisis or threat is unrelenting and chronic. And 2020 has been a challenging and stressful year for many of us:  a global pandemic, socio-political protests and upheaval, traumatic world events, financial crisis, political disruption....all layered with our individual life stressors....it\u2019s A LOT. Too much, even.⠀\n.⠀\n🌿Stress accumulates.  And our bodies and minds aren\u2019t designed to withstand unrelenting stress.  It depletes our resources and resilience and takes a toll on our physical and emotional health. This is where we can experience Crisis Fatigue.⠀\n.⠀\n🌿So if you\u2019re feeling unmotivated, exhausted, numb, or overwhelmed please know that it\u2019s ok.  It\u2019s not that you\u2019re \u201Cunable to cope\u201D or that you\u2019re \u201Cbeing lazy\u201D. You\u2019re literally trying to process an incredible amount of stress, crisis, and in many cases trauma.⠀\n.⠀\n🌿 Look after yourself.  Do what feels right for you.  And if you\u2019re feeling burned out, return to the self-care basics and build up from there.  Drink enough water. Eat regularly. Talk about your feelings. Breathe. And don\u2019t be afraid to ask for support.⠀\n.⠀\n🌿 You\u2019re not alone 💕⠀\n.⠀\n#mentalhealth #crisisfatigue #covid #haes #intuitiveeating #wellbeing #selfcare #takecare #pandemic #trauma","NumberOfLikes":9,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Kelley Ferguson on August 24, 2020.

The league is rerunning each test with the original sample and hasn't found any true positive cases. All 77 individuals also took point of care tests, all of which returned negative. NFL chief medical officer Allen Sills was slated to have a call Sunday night with team medical officials to share information and answer questions. \nIn its statement, the NFL said that the affected clubs \"are taking immediate precautionary measures as outlined in the NFL-NFLPA's health and safety protocols to include contact tracing, isolation of individuals and temporarily adjusting the schedule, where appropriate.\"\nAny player who tests positive for COVID-19 -- even if it is found upon retest to be a false positive -- must have two negative tests before he will be allowed to return to practice. The NFL said other BioReference laboratories used for NFL testing have not had similar results to that of the New Jersey lab. NFL testing is conducted exclusively by BioReference, but the tests are serviced by labs around the country to ensure results in 24 hours or less. The league has so far avoided team outbreaks during training camp.

While the lockdown has imposed many inconveniences, it doesn't mean we can not still pursue our dreans. In fact, use this period of time to make lasting changes that will impact your future!\n\nPost my end year review last year, I decided to start making small steps towards changing my career and enrolled into the Event Management course. One of the reasons why I chose Fitzwilliam Institute was the fact that the classes would had taken place twice a week in person at the Kings College. Well, the first couple did and then the COVID-19 had struck. I won't lie, the idea of doing online classes did not appeal to me at all; however the lecturers made a real effort to keep the Zoom classes interesting and engaging. A few months later, after submitting my final assignment and completing the Zoom exam, here I am holding my Diploma in Event Management with PR, Online PR & Social Media.\n\nMy point is don't give up on your dreams and learn to adjust. Ther will always be a curveball on every path your choose, but life is 10% what happens to us and 90% how we react to it. Attitude is everything!\n\nWe have a choice every day about the attitude we will embrace for that day. Once you realise the impact of your attitude and accept the fact that you hold the keys to your own success, the world is your oyster! \n\nWhat is your dream? Do you fancy learning something new? Why not do it now! Don't wait till next year!

That point when God seems so far away. You\u2019ve done all the right things, yet chaos and heartache is relentless. Just when you think you have a grip on life, #COVID strikes, causing a worldwide #pandemic! It has knocked you down you haven\u2019t worked in weeks. Bills pile up and you have no money. Turmoil awaits at every corner. Life is in shambles. God where are you? Why Lord do you stand far off? Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble? (Psalms 10:1) David, the chosen one, experienced the same thing. Despite his many accomplishments we find him asking #God had he forsaken him in Psalms 22:1 when Saul was in hot pursuit for his #life (1 Sam. 21:1-23:29). When David operated in the flesh, by his own understanding, he stayed frustrated and always running trying to figure it out. When he slowed down, prayed, and sought God, slowly things begin to change. Life will continue to throw situations at us. It\u2019s when we learn to stay in continuous #prayer, thanking God in all circumstances, and trusting God\u2019s word no matter the outcome God works in his #greatness! Learn to #trust his word; don\u2019t be afraid or terrified because the Lord your God goes with you, never leaving or forsaking you (Deut. 31:6).\n\n*\n#dailymotivation #dailyinspiration #dailymotivational #dailyquotes #quotestoliveby","NumberOfLikes":3,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The Real Big Tig on August 24, 2020.

With the help and support of our dear travellers and patrons we organized donation drives in the national parks to distribute food ration kits to the families of guides, drivers, gate staff, contractual labour and hotel staff. Till date we have distributed over 700 such kits in Kanha, Pench, Kaziranga and Manas.\nAnd we hope to keep doing so in the days to come.\nA big thank you to everyone who has helped us in this noble cause.\nIf you would like to contribute to our future donation drives, get in touch with us soon!\n\n#beyondwild #nature #wildlife #wildlifephotography #nationalpark #forests #jungle #india #donation #pandemic #covid19 #lockdown #quarantine #travel #tourism #travelphotography #travelgram #photography #conservation #natgeo #animalplanet #igers #instagood #instamood #tigers #kanha #animalsofinstagram #kaziranga #wildlifeconservation","NumberOfLikes":28,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598265401,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 24 12:36:41 CEST 2020","Location":"India"},{"CaptionText":"\"Essential\"\n\nRICOH GRiii\nSnapseed\n\n#grsnaps #ricoh #ricohgr #ricoh_GRiii #GRiii #GRist #shootGR @manaratalsaadiyat #isolation #manaratalsaadiyat #MASnewnorm #culturallyouth #conceptualized #essential #pandemic #newnormal","NumberOfLikes":35,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Photographer | AD_DMT 📷 🇦🇪🇵🇭 on August 24, 2020 tagging @manaratalsaadiyat, @ricoh_gr_official, @gr.russia, and @ricoh_gr_photography.
