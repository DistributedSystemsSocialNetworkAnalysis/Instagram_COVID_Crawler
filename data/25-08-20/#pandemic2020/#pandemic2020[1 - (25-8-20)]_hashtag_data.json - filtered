We hadn't done that in seven years. Our old home had too many trees blocking the night sky. But even seven years ago, the sky looked nothing like the one out here on the mesa. It seemed like there were more stars than there was negative space around them. They receded from bright planets and large twinkling orbs to tiny shiny pinpricks poked through the universe.\n\nThere are two things that happen when I look at the night sky. First, it occurs to me in unquestionable terms that I am a tiny speck of dust, that our planet is a speck of dust, and that I am a speck of dust on a speck of dust. We're just stardust. That's all. All of our concerns about taking up space in the world and how we do it-- how we look in our bodies, how big our house is, how nice our car is, how much money we make, how many friends we have, etc.--is meaningless when you look at the stars. All the stress of the world feels pointless.\n\nSecondly, when I consider that the stars I am looking at burned out billions of years ago, I attempt to wrap my mind around the idea that I am looking at the past, that I am in the future where those stars no longer exist, but I can see them. And I realize that time is irrelevant. Time as we perceive it--the linear, forward moving, one minute follows the next-- is false if we can stare into billions of years in the past in the same moment we take a breath in the present. And I realize that all of our worries about time are meaningless. I'm late. I'm too young. I'm too old. I don't have enough time. I have to meet this deadline. These are all constructs the human mind created to compartmentalize life into small boxes. And by construct, I do mean constrain. Our egos working daily to keep us contained and safe.\nRead more, link in bio...\n.\n.\n.\n#perseidmeteorshower #perseids #perseids2020 #offgrid #strawbalehouse #highdesert #desertlife #stardust #wearestars #quarantinelife #pandemic2020 #shelterinplace #stargazing #timeandspace #mindexpansion #higherconsciousness #writersblog #writerslife #writersofinstagram","NumberOfLikes":1,"Hashtags":["#perseidmeteorshower","#perseids","#perseids2020","#offgrid","#strawbalehouse","#highdesert","#desertlife","#stardust","#wearestars","#quarantinelife","#pandemic2020","#shelterinplace","#stargazing","#timeandspace","#mindexpansion","#higherconsciousness","#writersblog","#writerslife","#writersofinstagram"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Johanna DeBiase in Taos County, New Mexico.

As famílias envolvidas no manejo das abelhas sem ferrão estão recebendo apoio técnico do projeto Floresta Ativa, uma iniciativa da ONG Projeto Saúde e Alegria.\n\nNo período de 18 a 20 de agosto, técnicos do Floresta Ativa fizeram uma viagem para diagnóstico da cadeia da meliponicultura na várzea. Foram visitadas famílias das comunidades Nova Vista, São José, Pixuna no Tapará, Tapará Mirim e Santa Maria do Tapará que praticam a meliponicultura. \n\nA intenção do PSA, segundo o técnico Alexandre Godinho é identificar com o mapeamento quais precisam de apoio em capacitação, kits de manejadores, e formação em práticas de manipulação e higiene.\n\n\u201CSerão apoiadas 100 famílias na várzea com aproximadamente mil enxames de abelhas sem ferrão. Por meio do resultado do diagnóstico produtivo será definida estratégia de produção na região\u201D, disse Godinho.\n\nA cadeia da meliponicultura compreende desde o uso de técnicas sustentáveis de bom manejo de abelhas sem ferrão para a produção do mel e seus derivados, como o pólen e o própolis, até o beneficiamento do produto e sua comercialização.\n\nSegundo o extensionista rural, Márcio Roberto que acompanhou a equipe nas comunidades do Ituqui e Tapará, o diagnóstico é fundamental para traçar medidas assertivas para uma produção de sucesso. \n\n\u201CO objetivo é apoiar a cadeia do mel para que ela se consolide e gere renda para as famílias que serão assistidas pelo PSA. Fazer um planejamento das ações com objetivo de melhorar a produção para que o pequeno produtor possa entregar um produto de qualidade ao mercado\u201D.\n \nLink na bio.\n\nFonte: G1\n\n#covid19 #coronavirus #ONN #onovonormal #ONNpoliticapublica #covidart #covid2020, #covid19brasil #covidmask #covidphotodiaries #covidnews #covid19art #corona #coronavírus #coronavirusbrazil #coronaviruspandemic #coronavirusoutbreak #coronavirus2020 #pandemic #pandemicart #pandemic2020, #pandemicorona #pandemiclife #fiqueemcasa #futuro #reuniaoonline #homeoffice #trabalhandoemcasa #emcasa","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#coronavirus","#ONN","#onovonormal","#ONNpoliticapublica","#covidart","#covid2020,","#covid19brasil","#covidmask","#covidphotodiaries","#covidnews","#covid19art","#corona","#coronavírus","#coronavirusbrazil","#coronaviruspandemic","#coronavirusoutbreak","#coronavirus2020","#pandemic","#pandemicart","#pandemic2020,","#pandemicorona","#pandemiclife","#fiqueemcasa","#futuro","#reuniaoonline","#homeoffice","#trabalhandoemcasa","#emcasa"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by O Novo Normal in Santarém, Brazil.

This initiative will provide health and hygiene items such as bleach, soap, and over-the-counter medicines, in addition to foods, such as rice, cooking oil, spaghetti, flour, sugar, oats, potatoes, salt, tea, and canned milk to supplement the crops the people grow and the fish they catch. The generous size of the TWFF contribution will provide enough supplies to last the communities for FOUR months.\n\nWe at the NBHF are immensely grateful and humbled to be selected to receive such a significant donation. We are also deeply appreciative of musical artist and humanitarian Alexi Callinicos and her family for making this possible, as well as of Curassow Amazon Lodge, Grand Amazon Lodge, and Yaku Amazon Lodge & Expeditions for their assistance in the planning and execution of these efforts.  Please join with us in our joy as we celebrate this collaboration that will assuredly save the lives of some of the most isolated and poorest people in human society today. \n#ConserveLife #thewhitefeatherfoundation #TWFF #actionfortheamazon #nevadabuildinghope #nvbh #covid #covidrelief #pandemic #pandemic2020 #donation #indigenouscultures #remote #amazon #jungle #village #peru #conservation #sustain #hope","NumberOfLikes":11,"Hashtags":["#ConserveLife","#thewhitefeatherfoundation","#TWFF","#actionfortheamazon","#nevadabuildinghope","#nvbh","#covid","#covidrelief","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#donation","#indigenouscultures","#remote","#amazon","#jungle","#village","#peru","#conservation","#sustain","#hope"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598281071,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 24 16:57:51 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Just like that I have a 2nd grader!!

Many religious ceremonies involve singing, such as Sunday Mass at Church. A study found that singing caused 53 of the 61 choir members testing positive and 102 of 130 members of an Amsterdam choir developed COVID-19 after a performance, and four people associated with the choir died. In Austria, 43 of 44 participants in a choir seminar tested positive. \n\nRegardless of the distance between the musicians, harmony comes with dedicated, supervised practice. In an uncontrolled setting with distractions, dedicated practice is impossible. However, musicians also gain something by practicing at home. In a comfortable, relaxed environment they may be able to play better. Whether good or bad, stay-at-home musicians will give their audience a unique performance as they perform in the comfort, or discomfort, of their own home. \n\nhttps:\/\/thelcr.com\/can-music-programs-survive-covid-19\/ (article in bio) \n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n#thelcr #musicclass #virtuallearning #educationmatters #musiceducation #socialjustice #harmony #votingmatters #choirlife #choirs #choirmusic #justiceforbreonnataylor #musicals #musicianslife #education #musiciansdaily #singing🎤 #wesing #highschool #highschoolmusical #discrimination #choirdirector #beautifulvoice #beautifulvoices #pandemic2020 #teachersrock #musicteacher #musicmatters #jazzmusician #classicalmusician","NumberOfLikes":10,"Hashtags":["#thelcr","#musicclass","#virtuallearning","#educationmatters","#musiceducation","#socialjustice","#harmony","#votingmatters","#choirlife","#choirs","#choirmusic","#justiceforbreonnataylor","#musicals","#musicianslife","#education","#musiciansdaily","#singing🎤","#wesing","#highschool","#highschoolmusical","#discrimination","#choirdirector","#beautifulvoice","#beautifulvoices","#pandemic2020","#teachersrock","#musicteacher","#musicmatters","#jazzmusician","#classicalmusician"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The LCR in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Some gaming companies have seen greater profits during this turbulent time and as a result, are giving back to those who need it. It seems that Microsoft is keen to use its platform and Halo brand to support those who are battling the global pandemic.  Microsoft alongside Meta Threads is selling limited edition Halo face masks that help to support healthcare workers who are working to help those who have been impacted by the pandemic.\nCollaborations with Halo have already generated $430,000 for charitable causes that are fighting the coronavirus pandemic. However, the new apparel delivers materials to health workers directly and also rewards consumers with stylized mask protection. Fans of the Halo franchise simply need to buy a $19.99 face mask and two will be donated to medical employees as part of the #GamersMask4Masks Campaign.\n.\nLIKE this post! ❤️\nSHARE with your friends! ↗️\nCOMMENT down your thoughts! ✍️\nTAG one of your friends! 🏷️\n.\nFor more Gaming Stuff like this,\nFOLLOW - @_gaming.op_\n.\nFor Awesome Motivational Content,\nFOLLOW - @will.finds.way\n. \n~ tags ~\n#haloinfinite #microsoftteams #pandemic2020 #coronatime #covid2019 #masksforsale #workers #videogaming  #gamermeme #gamerlifestyle #gamingaddict #gamingvideos #gaminglogo #gamingtime #gamingpcbuild #gamingforlife #populargame #gameroom #gamecollection #gamer4life #gamersetup #gamerspc #gamingclips #gamingroom #gamingnewsdaily","NumberOfLikes":40,"Hashtags":["#GamersMask4Masks","#haloinfinite","#microsoftteams","#pandemic2020","#coronatime","#covid2019","#masksforsale","#workers","#videogaming","#gamermeme","#gamerlifestyle","#gamingaddict","#gamingvideos","#gaminglogo","#gamingtime","#gamingpcbuild","#gamingforlife","#populargame","#gameroom","#gamecollection","#gamer4life","#gamersetup","#gamerspc","#gamingclips","#gamingroom","#gamingnewsdaily"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Games, Gaming, News, Knowledge, Masks, Halo, Pandemic, Corona Virus, Covid 19","NumberOfComments":23,"Timestamp":1598268817,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 24 13:33:37 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#summer2020 #pandemic2020 #nyc20🇺🇸","NumberOfLikes":0,"Hashtags":["#summer2020","#pandemic2020","#nyc20🇺🇸"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Andre Mariano in Forbidden Planet NYC.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598268794,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 24 13:33:14 CEST 2020","Location":"Forbidden Planet NYC"},{"CaptionText":"Back to school! 🍁🎒📚 \n\n#nursingschool #nursingstudent #russellsagecollege #fallsemester #pandemic2020 #hybridlearning","NumberOfLikes":20,"Hashtags":["#nursingschool","#nursingstudent","#russellsagecollege","#fallsemester","#pandemic2020","#hybridlearning"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Victoria in Russell Sage College with @alyandaj.

I have a plethora of masks and face shields. I ordered in a small case of hand sanitizes or what we call at school \"hanitizer\u201D now if I could only get a good left foot (broke mine in a Red Lily Beetle battle . . . guess I lost). I got my \"things\" but am \"I\" ready? I worked at my school library throughout the pandemic with only a handful of people at the school. Schools in a covid-19 pandemic will look different. Not everything has been sorted out, but it will look different. No surprise there- most of 2020 has looked different. We are in this together and we will get through it together. One of my favorite words is HOPE. I've had to rely on hope and prayer throughout the last number of years. Some call,it a mantra and I call it my 'mindful or intentional words'. Here they are \"hope anchors the soul\" It races to my mind when \"worries voices starts chirping\" to silence him. What words\/phrases calm you down, focus your soul, and give your brain a rest?  Take a bit of time and grab some intentional words, they'll be ready when you need them.  School is not going to be the same when we get back. It's going to be better. We are adaptable and resilient folk who will do our best to create teaching moments like we've never had to create before. Our kids (and staff too) need community, need love and caring. They\u2019ll want us to understand that they feel many of the same feelings we do : apprehension, anxiety, uncertainty, but we also know we have the most resilient children too. Join the conversation about stress and fears, of expectations and anxiety together.

This is forever my favorite picture of him. He\u2019s going back to school tomorrow. We loved our beautiful Montessori school. Well, we still do in theory. It\u2019s not the school we don\u2019t love. He\u2019s having shorter days, and is only going for half the week for a fall and spring semester. Probably an estimated 40 days total. My heart feels so heavy about it all. A third of those days are about 3 hours long. \n\nHe used to love it so much. Never, not once, did he get upset during drop off. He occasionally said bye and waved me off, but normally he couldn\u2019t even be bothered to, he was to busy loving playing with his friends.\n\nHe said he felt different trying to go to bed tonight knowing he has school in the morning. We talked about how it would be all outside, and his best friend would be there. That cheered him up a little bit, enough to finally fall asleep. He seemed distressed. My little social butterfly, doesn\u2019t want to leave home. I know in my mama heart it\u2019s because of how the world is shifting. While I know there so much delicious potential to sneak a lot of goodness in with this shift, moments like these remind me of how hard it still can be. Remember to talk to your kids about what their next step is and check in with them regularly on it. This world is scary enough for them. It\u2019s scary enough for adults.

But this condition is a very real and scary thing if left untreated. I am lucky I listened to my body and went in to get this treated. I am hoping to soon be home with my son and my husband♥️ For anyone who thinks pregnancy or postpartum is \u201Ceasy\u201D.. think again and give those in your life who have given birth A LOT of credit because they deserve it💪🏼 Maternity Leave is NOT a vacation... it is NECESSARY for our body\u2019s recovery, especially under circumstances like these.

It seemed fitting to revisit today, the presumed 2020 Mont Tremblant Ironman race day, until the pandemic struck. We originally were registered for this year\u2019s  IMMT, then deferred to 2020 Ironman Maryland, which has also been cancelled. Although disappointing, I firmly believe there\u2019s no sense in stressing about things that you can\u2019t control \u2014 Sometimes, that\u2019s easier said than done.

The rules are marginally relaxed for children between the ages of 6 and 11, who are required to wear masks on a risk-based approach.\n🌟In a document on the WHO website dated August 21, WHO and UNICEF said that children aged 12 and above should particularly wear a mask when a one-metre distance from others cannot be guaranteed and there is widespread transmission in the area.\n🌟Whether children between six and 11 should wear masks depends on a number of factors, including the intensity of transmission in the area, the child\u2019s ability to use the mask, access to masks and adequate adult supervision, the two organisations said.\n🌟The potential impact on learning and psycho-social development, and the interactions the child has with people at high risk of developing serious illness, should also play a role.\n#facemask #covid19  #coronovirusoutbreak⚠️ #coronovirus #pandemic #pandemic2020 #eventstoday #instagram #insta #india #kerala #tamilnadu","NumberOfLikes":61,"Hashtags":["#facemask","#covid19","#coronovirusoutbreak⚠️","#coronovirus","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#eventstoday","#instagram","#insta","#india","#kerala","#tamilnadu"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by 🇪 🇻 🇪 🇳 🇹 🇸 🇹 🇴 🇩 🇦 🇾 on August 23, 2020.

Selama di kamp konsentrasi Nazi, ia mengobservasi bahwa tahanan yang tidak berupaya memperoleh makna dari penderitaannya, kelak mengalami degenerasi menjadi animalistik.\n\nGimana cara kita menemukan makna? Ada tiga cara menurut Frankl:\n1) Melalui cipta karya\n2) Melalui pengalaman atau perjumpaan\n3) Melalui sikap kita terhadap penderitaan yang tak bisa dihindari\n\nFrankl percaya bahwa rasa bersalah merupakan kesempatan untuk memperbaiki diri, dan krisis kehidupan memberi ruang untuk tindakan nyata. Setiap orang memiliki sumber daya \u201Cspiritual\u201D yang dapat dimanfaatkan dan dikembangkan untuk bertahan hidup dalam kemalangan apapun.\n\nKonsep Frankl tentang \u201Cmeaning of life\u201D tidak muluk-muluk. It can be as simple as accepting one\u2019s condition as an important role in the larger \u201Cdivine plan\u201D, or for the good of others.\n\nMisal: dalam masa COVID-19, orang yang biasa berkontribusi aktif di tengah masyarakat, mungkin merasakan depresi atau cemas karena saat ini ia tidak boleh banyak bepergian. Tetapi, ia bisa mencoba melihat bahwa perannya untuk #stayathome amat krusial untuk membantu tenaga medis dan menyelamatkan orang lain. Ia bahkan berkesempatan menggali hobi baru atau mengembangkan keterampilan terpendam, yang mungkin bisa ia ajarkan kepada anak cucu.\n\nMenemukan makna tidak selalu mudah. But it is an exercise of free will, man\u2019s true freedom, and the key to hope that heals.\n\n\u2014\n\u201CEverything can be taken from a man but one thing, the last of the human freedoms, to choose one\u2019s attitude in any given set of circumstances.\u201D\n(Viktor Frankl)\n\u2014\n\n#minimalism #minimalmood #rsa_minimal #agameoftones #makeitminimal #minimalismo #minimalismindonesia #bnwminimalismmag #mentalhealthawareness #sehatjiwa #depression #depresi #anxiety #hope #mentalhealth #covid19 #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":42,"Hashtags":["#stayathome","#minimalism","#minimalmood","#rsa_minimal","#agameoftones","#makeitminimal","#minimalismo","#minimalismindonesia","#bnwminimalismmag","#mentalhealthawareness","#sehatjiwa","#depression","#depresi","#anxiety","#hope","#mentalhealth","#covid19","#pandemic2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Anna Elissa, OP on August 23, 2020.","NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1598186834,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 14:47:14 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"On a run through #ontarioplace  I stopped to take in a quiet scene.\n---\n#reflection #reflections #reflectionphotography #pandemic2020 #pandemic #quietmoments #outandabout #outdoorphotography #outdooradventures #runthistown #torontolife #torontophotographer #torontoclx #toronto #walksinthepark #runnersofinstagram #summerinthecity #summer2020 #stayactive #freshair #jofto365 #lifeinthe6ix #6ixgrams #lifeinpictures #summerdays #citygram #cityvibes #cityofdreams","NumberOfLikes":14,"Hashtags":["#ontarioplace","#reflection","#reflections","#reflectionphotography","#pandemic2020","#pandemic","#quietmoments","#outandabout","#outdoorphotography","#outdooradventures","#runthistown","#torontolife","#torontophotographer","#torontoclx","#toronto","#walksinthepark","#runnersofinstagram","#summerinthecity","#summer2020","#stayactive","#freshair","#jofto365","#lifeinthe6ix","#6ixgrams","#lifeinpictures","#summerdays","#citygram","#cityvibes","#cityofdreams"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Julie M on August 23, 2020.

Semoga sampai tua kalian akur dan bisa saling jaga.\n \nTahun ini ada pendemi virus Corona jadi ga ada pesta ultah, ga bisa pergi Tozan\/ travelling kemana pas ultah Yora, dan tidak makan di luar karena masih kuatir.  Jadinya ultahnya sederhana aja di rumah bareng keluarga.

We played and we chatted. It felt like a little glimpse of pre-lockdown. Y\u2019know, when you could speak to strangers, share your kids snacks and toys and feel okay about it. \n\nI am so tired right now. Call it pandemic fatigue, call it whatever you want. \n\nI miss my son happily telling me what he did at nursery and all the friends he has made. I miss him never touching an iPad or watching endless hours of TV. I miss not having to put a mask on his face. \n\nI miss my parents not being anxious. I miss seeing people\u2019s smiling faces without a mask. Not just family, but strangers in the street. \n\nI miss being busy, going to birthday parties, going out for the day somewhere nice, entering a cafe and restaurant randomly rather than pre-booking etc. \n\nI miss the normalcy. \n\nSo don\u2019t feel like you have to pretend and keep pushing through.
