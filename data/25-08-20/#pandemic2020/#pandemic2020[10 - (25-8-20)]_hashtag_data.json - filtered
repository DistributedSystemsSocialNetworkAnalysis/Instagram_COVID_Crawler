This all began and was born out of love in the first month of the pandemic when fabric and elastic were impossible to get, and my family needed masks. I learned how to make them by cutting up and hand stitching cotton handkerchiefs together and sewing strips of them as ties until I could get better supplies. I had no idea that this would grow beyond my family and local donations. With each mask request I've continued to learn and improve, and 200 masks later, I now use a combo of hand and machine sewing to make them. I still complete every mask by hand stitching - It's a slow and meditative activity for me, and a personal touch of care I like to give to each one, and a connection to how we've all had to go back to the basics and simplify. Hopefully we won't need masks for long. But while we do, I'm determined to keep doing my small part. And I'll also keep trying to make them fun with cute fabrics! All of my masks are 100% cotton, have comfy adjustable ear loops, nose wire, and a filter pocket.

Todo esse contexto social acaba abalando a saúde mental de quem está cumprindo o isolamento, e para isso, achar uma forma de se entreter tem sido um ponto fundamental.\n\n\u201CA cultura em suas diferentes manifestações, a religiosidade, as boas práticas físicas, orientais e reflexivas, se convertem, nesse tempo de confinamento e pandemia, em verdadeiros antídotos contra a agressividade e disfuncionalidades\u201D, comenta a professora. \n\nLink na bio.\n\nFonte: Jornal do Campus\n\n#covid19 #coronavirus #ONN #onovonormal #ONNpoliticapublica #covidart #covid2020, #covid19brasil #covidnews #covid19art #corona #coronavírus #coronavirusbrazil #coronavirus2020 #pandemic #pandemicart #pandemic2020, #pandemicorona #pandemiclife #yoga #corpoemente #corpomenteespirito #autocuidado #autoestima #cuidado #descanso #alongamento #yogaemcasa #pilatesemcasa","NumberOfLikes":39,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#coronavirus","#ONN","#onovonormal","#ONNpoliticapublica","#covidart","#covid2020,","#covid19brasil","#covidnews","#covid19art","#corona","#coronavírus","#coronavirusbrazil","#coronavirus2020","#pandemic","#pandemicart","#pandemic2020,","#pandemicorona","#pandemiclife","#yoga","#corpoemente","#corpomenteespirito","#autocuidado","#autoestima","#cuidado","#descanso","#alongamento","#yogaemcasa","#pilatesemcasa"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by O Novo Normal in São Paulo, Brazil.

Life is such a gift and that is made even more clear when one is sick. Staying home still saves lives as large groups are to blame in California for continuous spread of COVID19. I am so grateful for my donor everyday. Im also grateful to have such amazing friends who feel the same way I do about protecting their health within this.

Moving to the city in 2016, Feven started jazz school two years later, and is going into her third year this fall. Her main instruments are trumpet and bass. Alongside jazz, she also plays experimental fusion and avant-garde music, dabbling in electronic on the side. \n*\nFeven\u2019s parents were born in Ethiopia, and immigrated to Canada in the early 90s. As a result of some family dynamic changes growing up, chances to connect with her heritage were slim. Over the past year, Feven has been taking Amharic lessons to learn how to read, write and communicate in her mother tongue, as well as learn to cook her country\u2019s food. Ethiopian culture is a study she wishes to continue, bringing both healing and education to her identity. You have to watch this.\n*\nUnlearn racism. Learn antiracism.

Daily Gratitude, it will literally change your attitude. Try expressing gratitude with your partner out loud every day. You can even be grateful for the sun, your car...ANYTHING. Acknowledging the things you\u2019re grateful for will instantly shower you with dopamine! \n.\n2. Protect Some Quality time together- even if it\u2019s in your bedroom after the kids are in bed...even if it\u2019s 15 minutes...connect! Talk! Have a nice dessert or cup of tea together! Invest in time together. Protect your relationship. \n.\n3. Focus on Self Improvement - the last thing a stressed out couple needs is to point fingers at each other and play the blame game all day. No one wants that. Accept your faults and work on them. Don\u2019t worry about what your partners faults are. You can\u2019t change him anyway! 🤷🏼\u200D♀️\n.","NumberOfLikes":159,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ❤️Dixie Andelin Forsyth❤️ on August 01, 2020.

Segundo levantamento divulgado pelo Escritório Central de Arrecadação e Distribuição (Ecad), o número de composições no maior acervo brasileiro cresceu, no primeiro semestre de 2020, de 12,5 milhões para 13,7 milhões, um aumento de 9,6%.\n\nEm números absolutos, os primeiros seis meses de 2020 registraram 1,2 milhão de novas músicas no cadastro do Ecad. Já no ano passado, no mesmo período, o número foi de 965 mil novos singles. \n\nVariação positiva de 24,3%. O motivo desse surto de criatividade está, diretamente, conectado com as medidas de combate à pandemia.\n\n\u201CPor estar mais em casa, com menos afazeres, os próprios cantores começaram a se voltar para o lado da composição, e os compositores que vive só disso aceleraram o ritmo de produção\u201D, explica ao Metrópoles o influencer Renato Sertanejeiro, um dos maiores especialistas do mercado sertanejo brasileiro.\n\nLink na bio.\n\nFonte: Metrópoles\n\n#covid19 #coronavirus #ONN #onovonormal #ONNpoliticapublica #covidart #covid2020, #covid19brasil #covidmask #covidphotodiaries #covidnews #covid19art #corona #coronavírus #coronavirusbrazil #coronaviruspandemic #coronavirusoutbreak #coronavirus2020 #pandemic #pandemicart #pandemic2020, #pandemicorona #pandemiclife #dj #musica #techno #producaomusical #sonsdapandemia #somemcasa #festaemcasa","NumberOfLikes":20,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#coronavirus","#ONN","#onovonormal","#ONNpoliticapublica","#covidart","#covid2020,","#covid19brasil","#covidmask","#covidphotodiaries","#covidnews","#covid19art","#corona","#coronavírus","#coronavirusbrazil","#coronaviruspandemic","#coronavirusoutbreak","#coronavirus2020","#pandemic","#pandemicart","#pandemic2020,","#pandemicorona","#pandemiclife","#dj","#musica","#techno","#producaomusical","#sonsdapandemia","#somemcasa","#festaemcasa"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by O Novo Normal in São Paulo, Brazil.

Then we proceeded to nail a board pin in each point and use our hammer to nail it. \nThe pins were sharp and needed super duper 🤯🤯🤯🤯 supervision but it\u2019s high time we let them experience the real world a bit in controlled settings. \nOh yes and then (drumroll plz) M made a shark with a super long tail and a long nose (shark is Bawa it seems 🤣🤣😂🙄🙄). Again just went with the flow and let him to do it as this helped with his motor skills practice. Gave a boost to his imagination as well. \nPS: It\u2019s 100 days of S.T.E.A.M. because M detests to write and colour so hopefully the art will help in that area (fingers crossed). \nPPS : It\u2019s officially August and can\u2019t believe my baby will turn 4 on the 4th 🤷\u200D♀️🤷\u200D♀️🤷\u200D♀️🤷\u200D♀️ and yeah I still haven\u2019t started loosing weight like I promised myself in 2010 😂😂😂😂. \nWELCOME TO LEVEL 8 OF JUMANJI  #100daysofSTEAM #day1of100 #invitationtoplay #oneactivityaday #oneactivityatatime #bawibackpacker #preschoolactivities #montessori #homeschooling #pandemic2020 #pandemicparenting #tagfromtheheart #motorskills #diyactivities #finemotorskills #everydayinvitationtoplay #playtolearn #playtolearn #screentimealternatives","NumberOfLikes":28,"Hashtags":["#100daysofSTEAM","#day1of100","#invitationtoplay","#oneactivityaday","#oneactivityatatime","#bawibackpacker","#preschoolactivities","#montessori","#homeschooling","#pandemic2020","#pandemicparenting","#tagfromtheheart","#motorskills","#diyactivities","#finemotorskills","#everydayinvitationtoplay","#playtolearn","#playtolearn","#screentimealternatives"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Pinaaz Pagdiwalla on August 01, 2020.

I have never seen doctors and healthcare professionals being shown more respect in the modern times. Even when I went out for grocery shopping now, there were instances when people ahead of me in the queue asked me to get my stuffs ahead of them, acknowledging the efforts that doctors all over the world are putting in to fight this period in history. But I only hope and appeal to the people that this be not just a transitory thing and that this feeling and emotion may persist even when the situations are more congenial healthwise to live in. \n\nThere have been way too many incidents of brutality being inflicted upon doctors in the recent past, some even leading to permanent injuries and even death of them. Isolated incidents are being reported still of families of covid patients succumbing to the illness assaulting the doctors on duty which I shall consider to be very shameful. I understand the lacuna that exists between the public and the medical system but aggression can hardly be a solution to it. Its the responsibility of us doctors too to stay patient and calm despite anything that might be happening around and still be at the best behaviour possible, personally and treatment-wise, while dealing with patients and their families. \n\nTherefore, I do not claim for extra appreciation just because I served during the covid struggle wearing the very uncomfortable PPE and uploaded a selfie because this is my primary responsibility and my oath to serve when I decided to be a doctor. But I do request to the people out there to believe in health professionals and their decade long educational knowledge before making judgements and prejudices. Because nothing is more hurtful than that. \n\nThe war shall be over soon. And decades from now, we shall all be a major part of history books and wikipedia stories. For just the next few more months, let's stay strong and united like we all have so far, and beat the hell out of this miscreant virus that has dared to challenge the beautiful global community. 🙂🍁\n\nUntil then, stay safe all. Eat well, keep the immunity going.

Además, en algunos sanatorios debemos dejar a los pacientes solos un rato, ya que no nos permiten cambiar la guardia dentro del sanatorio, lo que implica problemas con el frío y la inseguridad, ya que al llamar para avisar que llegaron, a varias compañeras le han robado sus celulares.\nOtro tema es que debido a que se han suspendido muchas cirugías programadas, estamos con mucho menos trabajo. Incluso teniendo en cuenta que hay menos acompañantes trabajando,  los mayores de 60 están en seguro de enfermedad, y hay otros acompañantes que están en seguro de desempleo.\u201D\nEl 20 de marzo entrevisté a Jorge que se encontraba aislado voluntariamente, desde el 15, por ser población de riesgo frente al covid-19.  Han pasado 4 meses y la mayoría de la población ha vuelto a sus puestos de trabajo por una cuestión de sostenibilidad económica. Este es el caso del \u201CMonje\u201D, retomó su labor el 12 de abril. \nA la fecha le  pregunto qué reflexiones le deja la situación que atravesamos con un sexto brote de coronavirus relacionado a centros de salud, y me cuenta:\n\u201CTe ponés a pensar que estás en la primera línea, en los sanatorios, que son de los lugares con mayor posibilidad de contagio, debido a su naturaleza misma, pero, más allá, no podemos dejar de trabajar, ya que el servicio en sí es indispensable para muchas personas,  además, está el tema económico, ya que si no trabajamos, no comemos, no podemos pagar las cuentas, no hay una solución para eso.\u201D","NumberOfLikes":35,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by AnA cUeStA on August 01, 2020.

Maybe, because I wasn\u2019t expecting everything to happen so fast. Or maybe it\u2019s because today I was supposed to be flying to Da Lat for a week long hollibobs in the mountain with my friends. Possibly, I just need time to pivot where I get my energy from, and again learn to slow down and adjust expectations accordingly.\u2063\n\u2063\nMost importantly, it\u2019s a time to be kind to ourselves. To just be, instead of always doing. To reflect on what\u2019s important in life and set small things in motion to always be content with who you are and what stage of the journey you\u2019re at.

We live in uncertainty. We learn to exist in instability. We search for stability around us but it is nowhere to be found.\n🔅\n\nWe have no choice but to keep on going. \n🔅 \n\n🔎 This is the life of someone living with a chronic health condition.\n\n🔎 This is the life of a parent with a challenging child.\n\n🔎 This is the life of someone being bullied.\n\n🔎 This is all our lives during a global pandemic.\n🔅\n\nWe often wait till the trauma is over to heal from it. But some of us don\u2019t have that luxury.\n🔅\n\nWe are in it and if we don\u2019t start healing now we are just going to slide further down the rabbit hole.\n🔅\n\nWhat if there was a way to heal from trauma while you are in it? \n🔅\n\nI\u2019m here to tell you you can, I\u2019ve lived it. My trauma nearly destroyed me on so many levels. \n🔅\n\nThe first place we can start is the breath. Intentionally deep breathing, not too forcefully and focusing on a long slow exhalation begins the process of bringing out body out of defense.\n🔅\n\nWe need to find ways of physically discharging our stress and distress. TRE (Tension\/ Trauma Release Exercise) is my chosen method but there are several others.\n🔅\n\nIntentionally reconnecting with self in an accepting and loving way is part of the process too.\n🔅\n\nWhen we love ourselves enough so much of what we struggle against falls away and allows us to find what we have truly been searching for all along.\n🔅\n\nThe safety within.\n🔅\n\nIt\u2019s there. For all of us.\n🔅\n\nSometimes we just need to start with the breath. It can give us the space and stamina to take the next step.\n🔅\n\nGo gently.","NumberOfLikes":71,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Emiline Duncan on July 31, 2020 tagging @heartsintrueharmony.

Well, we can help you with that! Medical workers need supplies since the pandemic is still in full swing. We\u2019ve made a free downloadable pattern to make a one-size-fits-all scrub cap with a convertible cuff! We\u2019ve also made video tutorials on YouTube and written instructions, complete with pictures on our blog. The cuff can be folded up to adjust for depth. There is also elastic in the back (so you can cram as much or as little hair underneath as you need to) and ties to make sure the cap is secure. The scrub cap consists of 3 main pieces (the Top, Base, and Cuff) and takes anywhere between 2 ½ to 5 hours from start to finish. Kelly, who\u2019s basically a beginner because she\u2019s only used a sewing machine probably three times (yes, I\u2019m talking about myself), took about 5 hours to get it done from start to finish. Amanda, on the other hand, has years more experience, takes about 2 ½ hours to make the scrub cap from start to finish. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a beginner or an expert, though. You also don\u2019t HAVE to make scrub caps to donate. You can make one for practice so you can hone your sewing, learn new skills, or make one for yourself or a loved one. \nIf you want to make scrub caps to donate to hospitals, nurses have told us that the best way to do so is to call your local hospital. Tell them that you have scrub\/surgical caps you want to donate and then arrange to mail them to a specific person who works there or drop them off at the hospital\u2019s ER or COVID floor.\nBe careful and stay safe, everyone! You can find our blog on our website and our videos on our new YouTube channel 💙💛😊\r\n.\r\nIf you\u2019d like to ask us any questions directly or make requests for future posts, you can find us on Facebook at First Stop Cosplay or Twitter at 1stStopCosplay\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\n#firststopcosplay #scrubcap #scrubcaps #scrubcaptutorial #stepbysteptutorial #helpmedicalworkers #worktogethertohelpothers #pandemic #pandemic2020 #covid19 #freepattern #beginnerfriendly #beginnersewing #donate #sewing #sewingtipsandtricks #cosplaytipsandtricks #cosplaysewing #cosplaytips #cosplay #cosplaylife #cosplayhelp #cosplayhelpline","NumberOfLikes":293,"Hashtags":["#firststopcosplay","#scrubcap","#scrubcaps","#scrubcaptutorial","#stepbysteptutorial","#helpmedicalworkers","#worktogethertohelpothers","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#covid19","#freepattern","#beginnerfriendly","#beginnersewing","#donate","#sewing","#sewingtipsandtricks","#cosplaytipsandtricks","#cosplaysewing","#cosplaytips","#cosplay","#cosplaylife","#cosplayhelp","#cosplayhelpline"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1596240240,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 01 02:04:00 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"grateful_mom_of_girls","CaptionText":"Just surviving our First Pandemic!\nThis week has been hard, I keep believing in better days are just around the corner and every day I came to realize that\u2019s not true.

Como vocês estão? Espero que todos bem, se cuidando e cuidando do próximo! \nVocê sabe como funciona o teste rRT-PCR e por que ele é considerado o padrão-ouro na confirmação da covid-19? Não? Vem comigo que eu te explico direitinho! \nO termo rRT-PCR vem do Inglês e descomprimindo temos \"real time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction\", que significa \"reação em cadeia da transcriptase reversa e polimerase em tempo real\" - mas o que é isso? Basicamente a técnica de PCR se baseia na extração de DNA de uma amostra de saliva, tecidos e\/ou secreções que é analisada em laboratório. Como pode acontecer de uma amostra ter muito pouco DNA, nós aumentamos essa concentração por meio de reações químicas -  por isso que mesmo com apenas um simples bulbo de cabelo podemos identificar em laboratório quem é a pessoa cujo DNA está presente naquele bulbo! \nSuper elegante essa técnica de PCR, né!\nO novo coronavírus é um vírus a base de RNA, então o laboratório o RNA viral é convertido em DNA, que chamamos de DNA complementar. Em seguida, o DNA complementar obtido é passado em um equipamento: se o DNA complementar estiver ali, então o equipamento acusa que a amostra é positiva para o novo coronavírus.\nQuer saber mais? Se joga no meu vídeo, meu amor! \nE se você ainda tiver alguma dúvida, é só perguntar aqui nos comentários que eu te respondo! \nE vale lembrar: se puder, fique em casa, lave frequentemente as mãos com água e sabão. Não tem saneamento básico na sua região ou no momento não tem pia por perto? Use álcool em gel! Se for muito essencial sair, use máscaras e mantenha o distanciamento social! \nLembre-se que não é só sobre você: saúde em tempos de pandemia é sempre um problema de todos! Pense nisso!\nSe cuidem!

But he refused to wear it.  We tried all sorts of masks. We tried everything from explaining, modelling, pretend playing, and even bribing.  He still refused to wear a mask. \n\nHe would however where his winter fleece neck scarf, that covered his mouth and nose.  But as the days got warmer, that wasn\u2019t very comfortable to wear.  So I had to get somewhat creative.  I got friend to cut of the sleeves from some of his old T-shirts, and sew it to make it into a neck scarf. Initially, I also just fabric glued the sleeves together. \n\nAlthough things are opening up, I\u2019m still not comfortable, so we are still being cautious and social distancing.  We live in a condo, therefore I make him wear his mask in the elevator and common areas of our building.  Once we are outside I let him take it off, and we keep our distance from other people. \n\nI do think wearing a mask is important. I don\u2019t understand the people who simply refuse to wear one, and having absurd excuses for not.  No wearing a mask isn\u2019t a 100% effective, but it does help a little bit.  It helps others, and it helps YOU!  To be honest, I do it to protect us.  WHO, CDC, local medical officers have stated certain things and then retracted certain things.  This is a new virus, the professionals are still learning about it. So I\u2019m going to do what I think is best.  For us that is wearing a mask, face covering and keeping our distance.  Really it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry. \n\nI do understand that some people cannot wear a mask due to medical conditions, or social\/emotional reasons.  I\u2019m not shaming those people, because I understand they have a valid reason. \n\n #wearamask😷 #mask #coronavirus #covid19 #pandemic2020 #quarantine #socialdistancing #thebabyramandmama","NumberOfLikes":9,"Hashtags":["#wearamask😷","#mask","#coronavirus","#covid19","#pandemic2020","#quarantine","#socialdistancing","#thebabyramandmama"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Brinda Ramanan on July 31, 2020.

In this tiny book in the Old Testament, God is depicted as a roaring lion. With loving patience, he warns of coming destruction, like a lion\u2019s roar signals to his prey of impending danger, God sends a siren call to his people.\n\nI recognize that so many times, I ignore that call. I continue on with life as usual. Until a global pandemic startles me from my stupor.\n\nI love how C.S. Lewis describes Shasta\u2019s interaction with Aslan the Lion in my favorite book from The Chronicles of Narnia series: The Horse and His Boy\n.\n\u201CWho are you?\u201D asked Shasta.\u201DMyself,\u201D said the Voice, very deep and low so that the earth shook; and again \u201CMyself,\u201D loud and clear and gay; and the third time \u201CMyself,\u201D whispered so softly you could hardly hear it, and yet it seemed to come from all around you as if the leaves rustled with it.\u201D\n.\nLike Shasta, I realize God is so much more loving and fearful, beautiful and frightening then my little mind can conceive.\n\nI\u2019ve often wondered what it is about the ocean that draws us. Maybe it\u2019s the  ocean\u2019s ability to calm us and frighten us all at the same time because of it\u2019s power and vastness. \n\nThe glorious truth is, when I look at Christ, I see the perfect balance of both and witness a beautiful and frightening God in the flesh enter our broken and busted world to wake us up from our stupor and show us a better way.\n\nThis Voice is the only voice that matters in a world of naysayers. How can I hear this Voice that is awesome, winsome, commanding and soothing all at the same time if my ears are filled with all the other voices? \n\nI don\u2019t want to ignore the call. Discipline me to have selective hearing in this time of multiplying voices. Tune my heart to hear His Voice above all the others.\n\n#covid19 #pandemic2020 #grief #lament #amos #cslewisquotes #jesus #greatgriefgoodgod #lifelessons #listen #aslan #beautifulandbold #holy #gentle #bibleverse #bible #hear #repentance #grace #kindness","NumberOfLikes":16,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#pandemic2020","#grief","#lament","#amos","#cslewisquotes","#jesus","#greatgriefgoodgod","#lifelessons","#listen","#aslan","#beautifulandbold","#holy","#gentle","#bibleverse","#bible","#hear","#repentance","#grace","#kindness"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Rachel Bochat on July 31, 2020.

Ridgeley Drive in Los Angeles. Please note that this is a private residence so if you visit please do not trespass or disturb the people that live there. \n\nWhen this series premiered, Executive producer Norman Lear had a track record of successful programs with \"All in the Family,\" \"Maude\" and \"Good Times.\" However in the mid-1970s, the concept of a show featuring a divorced woman or even the subject of divorce was considered too daring for audiences \u2014 even somewhat taboo.\n\nFun facts - in 1975 (when the series debuted), Bonnie Franklin\u2019s Ann Romano was only the second-ever divorced mother to feature on a TV sitcom. Though Vivian Vance\u2019s character on The Lucy Show was the first divorced mom character, many considered Romano to be the \u201Cfirst realistic portrayal of a divorced mother struggling to raise her teenage daughters.\u201D\n\nIn the original pilot, Ann (Bonnie Franklin) had only one daughter (Mackenzie Phillips). After executives frowned, a new pilot was shot with Valerie Bertinelli added as the second daughter.\n\nPat Harrington was the only actor from this show to win an Emmy, for his portrayal of Dwayne Schneider, the apartment building superintendent. Schneider, started out with amorous intentions toward Ann Romano but quickly developed into a family friend. \n\nValerie Bertinelli claims Mackenzie Phillips was very mean to her during the first season. Mackenzie admits this might have been due to jealousy and ego on her own part. Eventually the two became very close. #filminglocation #tvsitcom #onedayatatime #normanlear #bonniefranklin #valeriebertinelli #hollywoodtour #pandemic2020 #socialdistancing #wearamask #tonymiros","NumberOfLikes":68,"Hashtags":["#filminglocation","#tvsitcom","#onedayatatime","#normanlear","#bonniefranklin","#valeriebertinelli","#hollywoodtour","#pandemic2020","#socialdistancing","#wearamask","#tonymiros"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1596216829,"LocalDate":"Fri Jul 31 19:33:49 CEST 2020","Location":"Los Angeles, California"},{"Owner":"snackshub_bynikita","CaptionText":"Festive V I B E S ✨💝🎁\n\nWe are so happy to connect with our folks in Vadodara, who have specially ordered our Gift hampers, for Raksha Bandhan celebrations on 03Aug 2020..🤗\n\nThank you Akshay and Arpan for connecting with us.. \n\nSnacks Hub wishes you Happy Celebrations with your family and friends 💖\n\n#rakhifestival2020\n#rakhispecial😍\n#vadodara #gujaratcourier \n#festivevibes✨ #instadaily #instafood #snacksonthego #eatmunchies #sweettreats #snackshub🍃 #chefsofinstagram #homechefs_india #homechefs #foodprep #foodbloggers #stayhealthy #staypositive #staysafe #wearmasks😷 #weareinthistogether #pandemic2020 #familytreat😋 #foodsafetymatters #giftbox #crispybites😋 #festivaltreats","NumberOfLikes":29,"Hashtags":["#rakhifestival2020","#rakhispecial😍","#vadodara","#gujaratcourier","#festivevibes✨","#instadaily","#instafood","#snacksonthego","#eatmunchies","#sweettreats","#snackshub🍃","#chefsofinstagram","#homechefs_india","#homechefs","#foodprep","#foodbloggers","#stayhealthy","#staypositive","#staysafe","#wearmasks😷","#weareinthistogether","#pandemic2020","#familytreat😋","#foodsafetymatters","#giftbox","#crispybites😋","#festivaltreats"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Snacks Hub on July 31, 2020 tagging @aayulali, @nehapastakia, @___keyaa___, @arpanparnami, @nishita.l, @rajeshrikshah, @ketan_shah1961, @bharati_shah56, @plaliwala0806, @akshayl86, @jshah976, and @laliwalaviresh.

The goal of this project is to communicate how students are feeling about the state of our world right now while still maintaining quarantine.\n\n\u201CPeople just aren\u2019t taking [the pandemic] seriously. I think a lot of people are learning to spend time with themselves, which sounds so weird, but I feel like our generation is really social - we hang out with people a lot and we really depend on other people a lot, especially because of social media and everything. I\u2019m not saying social media\u2019s gone away, but we kind of learned there\u2019s stuff we can do that\u2019s fun by ourselves without other people. More self-reliance. [In terms of the Black Lives Matter movement], I think it\u2019s kind of crazy to see that people hide in plain sight, like not everything is perfect, people hide their true beliefs. Because obviously with what\u2019s going on a lot of people are being exposed, so it\u2019s crazy to see [that happen to] all these people that we\u2019ve been reading about and following and listening to.\u201D\n\n#portraits #portrait #portraiture #photoproject #photography #discoverportrait #featurepalette #global_portraits #makeportraitsmag #nextvisualportraits #endlessfaces #hvmansouls #creative_portraits #creativepeoplemag #thebmorecreatives #persuitofportraits #portraitmood #dynamicportraits #pandemic2020 #pandemic #covid19 #covidportraits #artofportraits #bravoportraits #profile_vision #portraitphotography #portrait_ig #portrait_shots #portraitstream","NumberOfLikes":37,"Hashtags":["#pandemicportraits","#portraits","#portrait","#portraiture","#photoproject","#photography","#discoverportrait","#featurepalette","#global_portraits","#makeportraitsmag","#nextvisualportraits","#endlessfaces","#hvmansouls","#creative_portraits","#creativepeoplemag","#thebmorecreatives","#persuitofportraits","#portraitmood","#dynamicportraits","#pandemic2020","#pandemic","#covid19","#covidportraits","#artofportraits","#bravoportraits","#profile_vision","#portraitphotography","#portrait_ig","#portrait_shots","#portraitstream"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Madeleine Phillips on July 31, 2020 tagging @washingtonpost, @baltimoresun, @glenechophotoworks, and @mckkennabishop.

All my life I'm tuned to celebrating occasions and a must for that is wearing new clothes. So, for every purchase, I mentally tag to an occasion or the other during the year and then the piece of clothing stays nicely tucked in my cupboard, till the occasion comes. If one is missed, then it goes to the next occasion and so on.\nBut life sometimes spans out a twist to show that things can't always go linear, or as planned; moreover, there's never any guarantee of life itself. The realisation has dawned more in this pandemic.. while we are grateful to be safe, healthy, with food and a comfortable life, with family and friends, the point to be noted is an entire year has gone away from our lives, wasted of the possibilities, the planned joyous moments, celebrations, vacations - even stripped of leading a normal life as we knew. It's debatable if we can ever \/ when  get back to our previous lifestyle, but till then, let's make the best of the situation.\n\nSo, from all the above thoughts, I inaugurated this Bishnupur katan silk saree with multicolored single ikkat designs all-over, without any occasion, after the saree was sitting in my cupboard for a year. The saree, woven in Bishnupur district of W Bengal, uses ikkat (tied n dyed yarns) from Sambalpur, dye the yarns again to bring desired hues and then weaving them with the warp of solid colored yarns. \nI loved this beautiful creation of 'design merger' with a contrast pallu. The designs are in matted hue, but sparkle brilliantly against light and during movement. You can see a close-up of the brilliant hues of the ikkat in the last collage.\nStay safe !

Nothing will benefit human health and increase the chances for survival of life on Earth as much as the evolution to a vegetarian diet. We should all be eating fruits and vegetables as if our lives depend on it - because they do. Green strongly influences the heart and helps alleviate tension. Positive qualities associated with green are generosity, humility, and cooperation. Foods of the green vibration are all green fruits and green vegetables.There is nothing that is comparable to it, as satisfactory or as thrilling, as gathering the vegetables one has grown. Adopting a new healthier lifestyle can involve changing diet to include more fresh fruit and vegetables as well as increasing levels of exercise. I like to pick my own vegetables. I do not believe that you have to spend a lot of money to eat well.So, if I'm cooking, I'll be steaming vegetables, making some nice salad, that kind of stuff.I keep my diet simple by sticking to mostly fruits and vegetables all day and then having whatever I want for dinner. I end up making healthy choices, like fish or eggs, because I feel so good from eating well. I never worry about diets. A lot of parents ask me how to get kids to eat more vegetables. The first thing I say is that it starts from the top. We can make a commitment to promote vegetables and fruits and whole grains on every part of every menu. And we can help create a culture - imagine this - where our kids ask for healthy options instead of resisting them. \n. \n. \n. \n#fight #covid19 #eathealthy #stayhealthy #buildupimmunesystem #gocorona #staysafe\n.\n.\n. \n. . \n@deboleena_howladar\n.\n.\n#food #foodporn #foodphotography #foodstagram #foodie #foodblogger #vegetablelover #healthylifestyle #healthyfood #quarantine #pandemic2020 #stayhomestaysafe  #gocorona #takemeback #blogger #contentcreator #vlogger  #photographer #foodphotography","NumberOfLikes":23,"Hashtags":["#fight","#covid19","#eathealthy","#stayhealthy","#buildupimmunesystem","#gocorona","#staysafe","#food","#foodporn","#foodphotography","#foodstagram","#foodie","#foodblogger","#vegetablelover","#healthylifestyle","#healthyfood","#quarantine","#pandemic2020","#stayhomestaysafe","#gocorona","#takemeback","#blogger","#contentcreator","#vlogger","#photographer","#foodphotography"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by c\/o দেবলীনা in Shyamnagar, West Bengal.

Others, are choosing to educate their children at home, but don\u2019t plan on it being long term and would like to send their child back to their school once they feel it\u2019s safe for them.\n.\n.\nI\u2019ll cover a brief overview of topics such as finances, requirements, record keeping, special needs, testing progress, curriculum, and what works for us right now. I\u2019m happy to have a wonderful video by @sidebysidelearningblog on record keeping, and have linked resources for legal help, state requirements, and more that I hope you find helpful!  My goal is to help give a bit of clarification for options, answer some of these common questions the best I can, and give resources for how to start homeschooling if that\u2019s your path!\n.\n.\nI would love to hear what your plans are for this year\u2019s school choices and if you\u2019d like to see a deeper dive into one of these topics! Stay tuned for my fun homeschool haul as a bonus post coming soon! 🥳🛍\n.\n.\n#homeschool #remotelearning #onlinelearning #distancelearning #recordkeeping #preschool #homeschoolschedule #howtohomeschool #curriculum #homeschoolcurriculum #specialneedshomeschooling #specialneedskids #montessori #eclectichomeschool","NumberOfLikes":213,"Hashtags":["#homeschool","#remotelearning","#onlinelearning","#distancelearning","#recordkeeping","#preschool","#homeschoolschedule","#howtohomeschool","#curriculum","#homeschoolcurriculum","#specialneedshomeschooling","#specialneedskids","#montessori","#eclectichomeschool"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Julia on July 31, 2020 tagging @sidebysidelearningblog.

I reminded her of this yesterday and we both shared a lot of laughs, however, after some thought, I still believe we could turn this year around for our children. With all of these restrictions, it challenges us as teachers to differentiate and go back to the drawing board. At first it felt like the children will be missing out on opportunities offered in years past. Erase that from your mind, it\u2019s our chance to relay the framework of education. We\u2019ve been handed an opportunity to test out new practices, activities, and teaching styles we may otherwise have continued to only brainstorm about.

Students should not be under the impression that examinations will be stayed because of the Supreme Court hearing,\" the UGC (University Grants Commission), which is charged with coordination, determination and maintenance of standards of higher education, said in court.\nDeclining to pass any final order on a clutch of petitions challenging the UGC's decision to hold final-year exams in September, the top court today adjourned its hearing till August 10.\nAppearing for one of the petitioners, Abhishek Manu Singhvi argued today that the UGC's guidelines to hold the exams, which include the option to hold them online, were arbitrary. Mr Singhvi pointed out that some of the universities lacked basic IT infrastructure and it was therefore not feasible to uniformly conduct online examinations.\n\"Optional exam is problematic. If someone cannot appear and is given a later option it will create chaos,\" he said, to which the court said: \"But it is for the benefit of students\".\nMr Singhvi argued \"heavens will not fall if exams are cancelled\" and referred to sections of the Disaster Management Act that allows state governments to take decisions in this regard.\nThe court then asked the Maharashtra government, which has cancelled final-year exams for state-run colleges, to place on record the decision taken by the state's disaster management committee.\nAmong the petitions heard today was one by Maharashtra cabinet minister Aaditya Thackeray via the youth wing of the Shiv Sena. The petition claimed the UGC was \"ignoring the physical and mental health... and safety of students\" by insisting the exams be held.\n#finalyearexams \n#healthoverexams \n#covid19 \n#coronavirus \n#covidinindia \n#pandemic2020 \n#maharashtragovernment \n#supremecourtofindia🇮🇳 \n#shivsena \n#udhavthackeray \n#adityathackeray \n#ugc\n#therealitycheckup","NumberOfLikes":3,"Hashtags":["#finalyearexams","#healthoverexams","#covid19","#coronavirus","#covidinindia","#pandemic2020","#maharashtragovernment","#supremecourtofindia🇮🇳","#shivsena","#udhavthackeray","#adityathackeray","#ugc","#therealitycheckup"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The Reality Check Up on July 31, 2020.

Медики подозревают, что это может быть совершенно новый, не изученный ранее тип данного заболевания. Кроме того, они предупредили, что COVID-19 способен приводить к серьезным осложнениям только начинающегося диабета.» ⠀\n⠀\nПолученных данных о взаимоотношениях диабета и коронавируса пока не достаточно, чтобы говорить о точном влиянии этой инфекции на углеводный метаболизм. ⠀\nУчёны пока не знают, является ли это манифестацией диабета 1 и 2 типов или это диабет совершенно нового типа, пока не изученного. ⠀\n⠀\nГлавной причиной возникновения диабета при коронавирусной инфекции может быть то, что COVID-19 является системным заболеванием. ⠀\n⠀\nПо мнению ученых CoviDiab Registry, так происходит потому, что SARS-CoV-2 в организме действует на АПФ2 \u2014 рецептор, который находится в главнейших метаболических органах и тканях, включая клетки поджелудочной железы, жировую ткань, тонкую кишку и почки. Ученые предполагают, что после проникновения в них COVID провоцирует многочисленные дисфункции в механизме углеводного обмена.⠀\n⠀\nХотя, никакой связи данного рецептора с развитием СД нет. АПФ2 скорее можно связать с сердечно-сосудистыми патологиями, бронхиальной астмой, но нет никаких данных о его связи с диабетом различных типов. Опять же, любая бактериальная или вирусная инфекция может стать «пусковым фактором» диабета 1 типа, так как это аутоиммунное заболевание и для него характерен «запуск» именно за счёт внешних факторов. ⠀\n⠀\nЧто интересно, ученые предполагают, что к развитию сахарного диабета может приводить и терапия COVID-19. ⠀\n⠀\nПри заражении COVID-19 обезопасить себя от развития диабета можно, проводя регулярный контроль сахара в крови.⠀\n⠀\nБерегите себя и своих близких! 🙏🏻","NumberOfLikes":62,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Эндокринолог|Казань|Екб in Kazan, Tatarstan.

Communities across the province have mobilized new mask regulations in response, including compulsory requirements on Calgary transit and in Edmonton shopping centres. Even picturesque Banff, known for its popular ski resorts and majestic national park, is ramping up COVID-19 measures.\n\nWith travel-loving Western Canadians unable to travel far, Banff has become a magnet for local tourism. Safety ambassadors hired by the town have handed out 100,000 masks for tourists to voluntarily wear so far, but that's about to change. As of tomorrow, people in all indoor public spaces and on the town's main street will be required to wear masks or face shields. The town council has publicly emphasized the importance of social distancing and mask use amid strong tourist numbers, fearing the potential for a local outbreak.

Tidak ada yang spesial dan berbeda baginya. \n.\nBeberapa hari ini kita telah disuguhkan dengan pemandangan ibadah haji di Al Haramain. Adakah yang berbeda ? \nYa. Jumlah yang dibatasi, tawaf yang direnggangkan, jama'ah wanita dispesialkan tawaf pada posisi paling depan, dan protokol kesehatan yang berlaku disetiap memasuki pintu Al Haramain. \n.\nNamun bukan itu titik fokusnya. Adakah yang menyadari bahwa hidup ini adalah pilihanNya ? \nSetiap lika liku yang kita alami tak luput dari ketentuanNya. \n. \nDari sekian banyaknya manusia yang ingin berangkat tahun ini dengan kapasitas Masjidil Haram yang mampu menampung hingga 2jt orang. \nAllah hanya memilih beberapa dari hambaNya untuk dimampukan melaksanakannya. \n.\nDari sekian manusia yang telah berdo'a jauh-jauh hari agar Ar-Rahman memberinya kesempatan untuk menginjakkan kakinya kesana sebelum akhir kehidupannya, tapi Allah menakdirkannya gugur sebelum waktu keberangkatannya. \n. \nJama'ah haji yang berhasil berangkat tahun ini adalah orang-orang spesial dan pasti memiliki amalan yang spesial pula. Sehingga, Al-Malik memilihnya. \n.\nUntukmu yang masih ditakdirkan bernapas olehNya juga merupakan suatu ketentuanNya. \nKarena begitu mudah bagiNya, jika Al-Karim berkehendak maka semua dapat terjadi. Namun ketika ia tidak menakdirkan, bukan karena Al-Ghofur mulai bosan dan tak peduli. Tapi karena  ada rencana yang lebih indah yang telah dipersiapkan untukmu dan akan diberikannya pada waktu dan tempat yang tepat, insyaa Allah. \n. \n#happyiedmubarak #eidadhamubarak #taqabballallahuminnawaminkum #selamathariraya\n#eidadha1441h #covid19\n#pandemic2020 #newnormal  #moeslimindonesia #alhamdulillah #alhamdulillahallakullihaal","NumberOfLikes":37,"Hashtags":["#happyiedmubarak","#eidadhamubarak","#taqabballallahuminnawaminkum","#selamathariraya","#eidadha1441h","#covid19","#pandemic2020","#newnormal","#moeslimindonesia","#alhamdulillah","#alhamdulillahallakullihaal"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Siti Hardiyanti Mursalam in Masjid Agung Mamuju.

NOT A SINGLE VACCINE.\n\nWhy?? Why are the \u201Cexperts\u201D so concerned that an oral medication given mostly to adults needs to have the proper Gold Standard safety studies done before it can be approved for use in covid patients- even though multiple doctors have come forward proving they\u2019ve had 100% success rates on their patients. Yet vaccines have never had a single gold standard safety study, hundreds of thousands of parents have spoken out claiming vaccines have injured or killed their children, and governments MANDATE vaccines??\n\nVaccines generate billions of profits for big pharma. 💰💰\nHydroxychloroquine is a cheap medication which does not bring in a significant amount of revenue like vaccines do.\n\nDo you see the problem here???\u201D - Michelle McMillan, RN\n\n#FOLLOWTHEMONEY","NumberOfLikes":37,"Hashtags":["#FOLLOWTHEMONEY"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1596157643,"LocalDate":"Fri Jul 31 03:07:23 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"margethebluetick","CaptionText":"SOOO TIRED 💤 \n.\n.\n.\n\n#margethebluetick #marge #largemarge #bluetick #coonhound #hound #houndpuppy #puppy #bluetickcoonhound #puppylove #puppyface #puppiesofinsta #dog #dogsofinsta #dogcrushdaily #socalpups #happypuppy #sleepypuppy #tired #rufflife  #mygirlblue #sotired #biggirl #quarantinelife #alwaystired  #pandemic2020 #bigears #bigpaws #mygirl","NumberOfLikes":11,"Hashtags":["#margethebluetick","#marge","#largemarge","#bluetick","#coonhound","#hound","#houndpuppy","#puppy","#bluetickcoonhound","#puppylove","#puppyface","#puppiesofinsta","#dog","#dogsofinsta","#dogcrushdaily","#socalpups","#happypuppy","#sleepypuppy","#tired","#rufflife","#mygirlblue","#sotired","#biggirl","#quarantinelife","#alwaystired","#pandemic2020","#bigears","#bigpaws","#mygirl"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Marge Blue Mountain on July 30, 2020.

I was capable, intelligent, filled with creativity, but I never clicked with others my age. Growing up, I constantly struggled with my identity and tried to fit in with the crowd -- buying expensive clothes, talking like others, smoking and drinking to look cool -- but compromising who I was in the process.\n \nOne day, after smoking a lot of cannabis, I was thrown into a state of anxiety unlike anything I had ever known, which I have now learned is called \u201Cdepersonalization.\u201D It felt as if I was in a dream, and everything around me became fuzzy and blurry. It was terrifying. I thought I had broken my brain. It didn\u2019t go away, and I spent about a full year in confusion, not having any idea what was wrong with me. \n \nMy mom took me to various psychiatrists, psychotherapists, alternative doctors, and everything in between. I tried everything, including self-help courses and different forms of meditation, but although I got a little relief here and there, nothing truly fixed the problem. I felt completely disconnected from reality, disassociated from my body, numb, and unable to tell what was real and what was not. \n \nI got so desperate that I flew to the Peruvian jungles at the age of 18 to try ceremonial plant medicine.  Again it helped a little, but soon I was back to square one, more anguished than ever. \u2018What is WRONG with me??\u2019\n \nI started watching clips of different spiritual masters and eventually saw one of Sadhguru. I was absolutely captivated by his videos. Day in and day out, I was watching videos of Sadhguru until finally I registered for the Inner Engineering course in the spring of 2018. \n \nThe class was long and painful, as my body was stiff as a rock. I did not understand what I was receiving at the time, and in fact it took me a year to fully understand, but I am now clear on the fact that this has changed my life forever.

I comforted her when she needed me, and I rocked her to sleep countless nights just so I could hold her for awhile longer. I cheered her on as she took her first steps, I kissed her boo-boo\u2019s, I fulfilled her every need, and I begged her to stop growing so quickly.

I didn\u2019t realize it until I felt the enormous butterflies in my stomach and the lump in my throat as I pulled into the school parking lot today and turned to her with tears in my eyes & asked if she was ready to meet her teacher.. and without hesitation she screamed YES! \n\n  In a few years I will probably be popping the champagne on the first day of school, but right now these emotions are strong. The simple thought of dropping her off on the first day brings an instant stream of tears. \n \n  The first day of kindergarten is coming, and that I can\u2019t stop it, but let me be sad for awhile.

When a child or an adult feels like they\u2019re not being seen, or connected with, it\u2019s easy for them to act out or attention seek. This can look like something as simple as a child having a temper tantrum or as toxic as a spouse having an affair. We all need connection, and during a time when we are asked to stay home and cut ourselves off from others, it can be very easy to feel discouraged.\n\nWhat happens when we change our perspective from taking a person\u2019s actions personally (making it about ourselves) to getting curious about what is going on for the one \u201Cmisbehaving\u201D or \u201Cacting out\u201D. For example, many years ago, I worked as a tutor at a school and one day I was working with a little boy who was about 9 years old. He lied to me and I remember taking it very personally and feeling hurt. How could this little child who I thought I had a good rapport with lie to me? It was in that moment that I realized I was making a huge mistake - I was making it about me instead of getting curious about why he would feel the need to lie. At the time I did not have the tools to go beyond my curiosity, but now I realize he was feeling discouraged about the process of learning to read. He didn\u2019t want to be there, and when I made his lie about myself instead of tuning into him I did him, and myself, a disservice.\n\nWhether you have a child or not, you have an inner child that also craves connection and can be discouraged when that connection is not there. Notice how the pandemic is affecting your child or your inner child. Are you noticing feelings of discouragement? Are you, or your child, acting in ways that are surprising you?\n\nFeel free to dm me or comment below.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#curiosity #discouragedchild #positivediscipline #bahaiteachings #practicalspirituality #practical #spirituality #bahai #changemaker #motivationalspeech #therapy #coaching #lifestyle #spiritualcoaching #healing #discouragement #actingout #misbehaving #dramatherapy #therapist #spiritualpractice","NumberOfLikes":65,"Hashtags":["#curiosity","#discouragedchild","#positivediscipline","#bahaiteachings","#practicalspirituality","#practical","#spirituality","#bahai","#changemaker","#motivationalspeech","#therapy","#coaching","#lifestyle","#spiritualcoaching","#healing","#discouragement","#actingout","#misbehaving","#dramatherapy","#therapist","#spiritualpractice"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Rezal Martinez, MA, P-RDT on July 30, 2020 tagging @childathearthealing.
