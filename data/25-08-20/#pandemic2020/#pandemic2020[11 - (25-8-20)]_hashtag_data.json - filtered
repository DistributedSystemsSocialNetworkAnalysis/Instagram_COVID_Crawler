It was stunning. I ate cheeseburgers sitting on a curb downtown, watching businesses barricade their doors while tourists in little Italy snapped pictures. It was March 16th. \n\nThere is an underlying frequency lately of how we\u2019re all supposed to act the same. We\u2019re all supposed to give a fuck about the company profit margins despite tremendous fear of an invisible deadly virus, and discuss things like traffic, taxes, makeup, when we can get our nails done and when we can book a trip. It\u2019s all noise. \n\nMost of my adult life I\u2019ve had to keep my hair certain colors so I would look a certain way for a job. I\u2019ve decided to cancel that. \n\nMy hair is a mess, my life and career are not. Something shifted for me when everything shut down.

BUCKLE UP. Lol üòÜ So, back in January I quit my job as a case manager at a homeless shelter. Long story short, it was a very hard job. After my leave, the coronavirus hit and it was so hard to obtain ANY kind of employment. I was very discouraged and felt a bit hopeless. I know I needed a lot of healing from my previous position, so I praise God for allowing me to rest during this time. I\u2019m such a busy bee, so I decided to invest more on social media. I started being more active in March and BAM - 4 months later I\u2019m plugged into this community & possible a new path for my life. \n\nI am extremely grateful and love that I get to use my platform - but for those who are in a situation like me, I feel for you! I am still unemployed, I am still stressed about finances, and I am still figuring out how to cope with it. For anyone who has lost a job, has their pay cut, hours cut, or anything that has them worried about their bills - you are not alone! During this season, I\u2019ve been through a whirl of emotions - literal ups and downs... but what gets me through is knowing God has always been faithful to me and will continue to be. I don\u2019t know where you put your hopes and faith in, but I put mine in Jesus. \n\nAnyone who wants to talk, my DM\u2019s are open! I hope this encourages anyone to keep hanging on.","NumberOfLikes":424,"Hashtags":["#pinkwednesday"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by rachel | 2 live giveaways ‚ú® in Indianapolis, Indiana with @peachandlily, @clinique, @lilahbeauty, @stylekorean_global, @romwe_us, @mamonde_us, and @rachelherphotography.

I'm Amber, a clinical therapist with experience working with children and their families. @connectwithplay is a place to come for caregiver\/parent advice, support and inspiration. \n\nOur children are struggling. Play is like medicine. \n\nFree play is classified as unstructured and undirected play which is led by the child\u2019s imagination. It is an enormous force, which enhances so many facets of their development. Most importantly, free play helps to release negative energy and hard to name feelings in children, has the ability to help children to gain a sense of mastery over a problem and gives them back the power they may have lost. If I could describe it so that adults could relate, play provides children with the same feeling as an adult would have after a massage - restored, rejuvenated and calm.\n\nThe difficulty we face is this, how can we encourage it when our child is pulled in so many directions by technology, structured activities and television?\n\nChildren will only engage in free play, which can ultimately be healing and restorative, when they are not distracted and when they feel emotionally safe to do so. Hopefully you find this post helpful in promoting free play with your little. \n\nHow do you encourage free play at home?? I would love to hear from you about your experiences.\n\n#regulation #toddlerlife","NumberOfLikes":262,"Hashtags":["#regulation","#toddlerlife"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":20,"Timestamp":1596035232,"LocalDate":"Wed Jul 29 17:07:12 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"psychologistanugoel","CaptionText":"#Episode1 #mentalissues #psychologistanugoel #stress #pandemic2020 #mentalhelptips #mentalhealthmatters #mentalhealthawareness","NumberOfLikes":22,"Hashtags":["#Episode1","#mentalissues","#psychologistanugoel","#stress","#pandemic2020","#mentalhelptips","#mentalhealthmatters","#mentalhealthawareness"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1595403568,"LocalDate":"Wed Jul 22 09:39:28 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"eph5.11","CaptionText":"COVID-19 has a cure. #HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE  #Zinc #STELLAIMMANUELMD. #realscience #hydroxychloroquine #HCQ #pandemic2020 #covid19 #covid911 #falseflag #pandemic  #zinc #vitaminD #therapeutics #dr #stellaimmanuel #covid #coronavirus #god  #digitalsoldiers #citizenjournalist #curetocovid #realdoctors #deepstateexposed #thankgod #victory  #wakeuppeople","NumberOfLikes":2,"Hashtags":["#HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE","#Zinc","#STELLAIMMANUELMD.","#realscience","#hydroxychloroquine","#HCQ","#pandemic2020","#covid19","#covid911","#falseflag","#pandemic","#zinc","#vitaminD","#therapeutics","#dr","#stellaimmanuel","#covid","#coronavirus","#god","#digitalsoldiers","#citizenjournalist","#curetocovid","#realdoctors","#deepstateexposed","#thankgod","#victory","#wakeuppeople"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by EPH5:11 on July 29, 2020.

Dr Immanuel\u2019s dataset contains 350 of her patients that survived COVID while on this drug. \n.\nHer data set is already skewed by the nature of her patient population. She works at a walk-in clinic in a strip mall. Not a hospital. So she is clearly not seeing the sickest patients requiring oxygen, ventilation, or ECMO. \n.\nSecond, there is no placebo arm, which already negates her non-published  anecdotal experience as being less than level A evidence (the best evidence to prove causality with an intervention.) These are achieved by performing double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCT). The largest RCT to date on hydroxychloroquine is out of the UK where of 1542 hospitalized patients treated with hydroxychloroquine, 25.7% had died after 28 days, compared with 23.5% in a group of 3132 patients who had only received standard care. \u201CThese data convincingly rule out any meaningful mortality benefit,\u201D. \n.\nNext to the prophylactic benefits. Dr. Immanuel claims that all her staff are on hydroxychloroquine and none have contracted COVID, thereby proving its benefit. Her staff in a walk-in clinic likely caps at 10 or so people. How much are we going to hang our hat on that data? My entire block of families (30 people plus) are NOT on hydroxychloroquine and none of us have contracted COVID. We have 6 physicians on the block and none of the staff in our respective clinics have contracted COVID either. So...that claim doesn\u2019t hold water.\n.\nLastly, she claims because some in vitro (pitri dish) study back in 2005 on a DIFFERENT coronavirus showed benefit with hydroxychloroquine to kill the virus, that this somehow would translate to meaningful human data on an entirely novel coronavirus.

When 2020 is over, I want to look back and see all the reasons I should be thankful rather than only focusing on things I don\u2019t have or didn\u2019t do. I want to look back and see that I was content with where 2020 brought me. I want to trust in God\u2019s timing and not worry about my plans I create for myself.\u201D\n\nI found this little journal entry snippet yesterday and it made me laugh out loud at just how relatable it\u2019s turned out to be. I\u2019ve always been a planner, and when I laid out the year before me in my head, I certainly didn\u2019t predict the majority of what 2020 has thrown my way. I recognized early on that, while my type-A, super-planner personality has a time and a place (and I\u2019ve come to accept that this is just a part of who I am), it isn\u2019t exactly an end all, be all in every aspect of life- and 2020 didn\u2019t take long to really smack me square in the face with this hard truth. Thank goodness I made it a goal early on this year to not dwell on my own plans, but to trust in His plan- which has not always been easy.\n\nFlashback to St. Patrick\u2019s day: Derrick is temporarily laid off due to the pandemic and that same night I decided to take a pregnancy test, never believing it would be positive. Surprise!! God had a way of teaching us to trust in his divine plan, and 2020 sure has been my year to learn this lesson. \n\nWith all the challenges we\u2019ve faced, we are still so blessed to be bringing a little boy into the world this November. I\u2019ll look back on this year as the one that gave me my greatest blessing in life, rather than dwell on all the uncertainty 2020 brought with it.

After a busy day at work, both Mom and I went to the local blood drive at the YMCA to donate blood.\n~\nThere is an urgent need for blood donations. Donating blood products is essential to community health and the need for blood products is constant. Please consider joining the #LifesaversClub and be a hero to someone. Donate blood. Since whole blood donation can be split into three compartments (red blood cells, plasma, platelets), it potentially can save 3 lives with 1 donation!\n~\nFurthermore, if COVID antibodies are detected in your plasma from a past known infection or unknown exposure, it can also be transfused to a critically ill hospitalized COVID patient in need of blood products, in the hopes that additional antibodies will boost their immune system and stimulate recovery. During this crisis, if you have been diagnosed COVID positive and completely recovered, you can specifically donate your plasma with COVID antibodies, called convalescent plasma donation (takes a little bit longer than typical whole blood donation).\n~\nLook for local blood drives in your community through the American Red Cross or The Blood Connection (in partnership with MUSC). If you are a local business or church interested in hosting a blood drive, you can contact these organizations to arrange a community blood drive and make a difference.\n~\n\u201CSocial distancing does not have to mean social disengagement.

We've completely halted our in-person consultations, audio and video production, and event partnerships to do our part in social-distancing. \n\nStill... we haven't given up.

In the past, we've focused our services on traditional advertising only, but now we also offer digital marketing services to local businesses (both small and large) to help them expand their brand visibility across all of their social media platforms. \n\nOur new service includes:\n‚úÖ Social Media Management\n‚úÖ Full content creation \n‚úÖ Post scheduling & Automation \n‚úÖ Community Management & Engagement \n\nWe are excited about this change, and we also want to encourage you to think about how you can pivot as well.\n\nDo you need help shifting gears during the COVID-19 pandemic?

With the news breaking of these doctor there is an attempt to keep our nation in this state of fear and hysteria by the left for political reasons. But I prophesied that there would be an exposure and we are seeing it. Pray with me that Facebook and Twitter would not be able to silence these doctors. \n\nVision of Covid-19 Exposure \n\nWhile standing in line getting some things for the house, I saw had a vision and saw the words \u201CExposed\u201D hanging in the air. I began to ask the Lord what he meant and he began to share some things with me. First, I believe Covid-19 is a real threat and I have compassion on those that have gotten sick or even died. But there is a attempt by some of those in power to make this virus look worst than it is. One way I saw them doing this is through hospitals being told to forge numbers to make Covid outbreaks appear worst than it actually is. I saw hospital scandals in which certain hospitals get called out for not accurately reporting information. These things will be exposed before the end of year, and many will be very surprised.\n\nWhy, you might ask, would they do this? Simple! To keep the economy weakened, to push their agendas, and to make a Donald Trump look bad. To make it look like he, and others mayors and governors, are stupid for reopening the economy. This is about keeping the economy weak so Trump can\u2019t use the amazing numbers we were seeing of record employment and things like this to run on. Same principle applies to the cities that are experiencing great violence and lawlessness. These, mostly democratic, leaders won\u2019t do anything because of the election and keeping control. But that too will backfire. We will see it in the months ahead, as these things are greatly brought to light.\n\nPlease pray with me that these things are exposed and that the plans of the enemy will not prevail. #COVID19 #america #pandemic2020 #doctorcovid19","NumberOfLikes":15,"Hashtags":["#COVID19","#america","#pandemic2020","#doctorcovid19"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1595967374,"LocalDate":"Tue Jul 28 22:16:14 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"daily.redpill","CaptionText":"Doctors who cured 350 coronavirus patients with 100% success rate soeak out passionately in Washington D.C.\n.\n.\n.\n#hydroxychloroquine #hcq #hcqworks #medicine #covid19 #coronavirus #cure #health #pandemic2020 #doctor #life #bigpharma #deepstate #coverup #censorship #digitalsoldiers #thetruth #truth #censored #medical #outoftheshadows #breakingnews #news","NumberOfLikes":17,"Hashtags":["#hydroxychloroquine","#hcq","#hcqworks","#medicine","#covid19","#coronavirus","#cure","#health","#pandemic2020","#doctor","#life","#bigpharma","#deepstate","#coverup","#censorship","#digitalsoldiers","#thetruth","#truth","#censored","#medical","#outoftheshadows","#breakingnews","#news"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1595967227,"LocalDate":"Tue Jul 28 22:13:47 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"humorous.daily","CaptionText":"Manual of wear a face mask!? ü§£üòÇ\nPlease like, commend and share @humorous.daily üëèüëç\n.\n.\n.\n#memes #memesdaily #memestgram #funnymemes #funny #haha #hahaha #fun #funnymemes #funny #funnymemes #funnymemesdaily #explorepage #explore #humor #humormemes #darkhumor #darkmemes #covid19 #covid_19 #pandemic2020 #quarantinelife #wearamask #dog #dogsofinstagram #funnydogs #funnydogmemes","NumberOfLikes":17,"Hashtags":["#memes","#memesdaily","#memestgram","#funnymemes","#funny","#haha","#hahaha","#fun","#funnymemes","#funny","#funnymemes","#funnymemesdaily","#explorepage","#explore","#humor","#humormemes","#darkhumor","#darkmemes","#covid19","#covid_19","#pandemic2020","#quarantinelife","#wearamask","#dog","#dogsofinstagram","#funnydogs","#funnydogmemes"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Humorous.daily on July 28, 2020.

Hi everyone, this is just a gentle reminder that we are still facing a health pandemic. In the US, there have been over 4 million cases of Covid-19, of which, 146,546 have resulted in death to date. [CDC statistics updated today 7\/28\/20] This is very serious and utterly heartbreaking. üíîüíî\n‚ú®\n\nPlease continue practicing all safety precautions including wearing a mask or some kind of protective face covering when you go out, practice social distancing from others, wash your hands and refrain from making extraneous trips.\n‚ú®\n\nRemember that health pandemics will always hit the most marginalized the hardest. Black Americans are hospitalized with Covid-19 at higher rates than other ethnic or racial groups. [Pew Research Center] Taking safety precautions means we are also protecting the most marginalized groups.\n‚ú®\n\nSevere physical-health illnesses can be quite traumatic and so self-protection and the protection of our fellow humans is trauma-prevention, thus trauma-informed.\n‚ú®\n\nIf you\u2019ve contracted and are sick with Covid-19 I am wishing you good health and a speedy recovery.

If these needs are not met they can impact greatly on our mental and physical health.\n\nüî∏Ô∏èBASIC NEEDS\n\n* Our basic needs are all needs below self-actualisation.\n* If you're focused on meeting your basic needs, you may feel fear, anxiety and depression.\n* Maslow believed that basic human needs can be fulfilled only through other human beings. If this is the case, then these needs are not being met during the current pandemic.\n\nüîπÔ∏èPHYSIOLOGICAL NEEDS\n\n* Everyone has physiological needs. \n* We need food, air and water to survive.\n* When we need food we eat. If we do not have food, we become anxious and distressed.\n* This is very real for a lot of people right now all around the world due to job loss and panic buying.\n\nüî∏Ô∏è SAFETY NEEDS\n\n* To fulfil our most basic safety needs, we need a roof over our head, job security and family love.\n* If we do not have enough money to pay for bills and to feed our families, then our safety needs are not being met.\n* Multiple Australians and many others across the globe have lost their jobs due to COVID-19; this means there is a real possibility that many people are not having there safety needs met.\n\nüîπÔ∏è LOVE AND BELONGING NEEDS\n\n* For our love and belonging needs to be met, we need to feel love and support from our loved ones. We need to feel like we are wanted, and that we belong.\n* A lot of immediate families are together, feeling loved. However, just as many are separated from their loved ones or trapped in violent homes - deprived of any love.\n\nüî∏Ô∏èüîπÔ∏èüî∏Ô∏è IN CONTRAST\n\n* Maslow also believed it was important to deal with life's ups and downs from a growth mindset. That is, looking at stressful and challenging times as opportunities for growth, rather than feeling defeated.\n* For this reason, we need to look at this huge impacting moment in our lives as an opportunity to discover the inner strength that we never knew existed. ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§üí™üß†\n\n#mentalhealth #depression #anxiety #mentalhealthpandemic #abrahammaslow #growthmindset #pandemic2020 #covid19 #needs #family #humantouch #safety #psychologystudent #psychology #hardtimes","NumberOfLikes":9,"Hashtags":["#mentalhealth","#depression","#anxiety","#mentalhealthpandemic","#abrahammaslow","#growthmindset","#pandemic2020","#covid19","#needs","#family","#humantouch","#safety","#psychologystudent","#psychology","#hardtimes"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Eloise Meyer on July 28, 2020.

Here are some takeaways:\n\n1. BFYT in lieu of BYOB - Bag From Your Trunk instead of Bring Your Own Bag. Stores here in CA will not allow use of your reusable bags in stores but you can let them know that you have your own. They\u2019ll put your groceries back into the cart sans bags and you can bag them with your own from your trunk.\n2. Reusing to-go containers from ordering in (we definitely did this when we needed to take a break from cooking). I\u2019ve put them to good use by storing washed veggies and fruits in them. They actually have more capacity than my usual containers. I\u2019ve also used them for transferring mulch\/soil in the garden and storage for Joseph\u2019s toys since a few of his storage bags went missing.\n3. Decrease use of plastic\/extraneous packaging with online orders like Instacart and food takeout by making clear requests in the comment section like: -No plastic produce bags.\n-Use paper-bags with all groceries and consolidate please.\n-No condiments, utensils, or napkins please. \n4. Toilet paper rolls are great when cut\/shredded and put in compost bin since many have started their victory garden since the pandemic. It\u2019s also great for arts & crafts for your young ones. \n5. Reusing glass jars have been great during this hot summer for catching bugs like spiders around the house. I\u2019ve caught about 5-8 and let them free in the yard. They\u2019ve also been great vessels for DIY essential oil based products (check out my DIY EO highlight), homemade sauces\/food, and for propagating plants.\n\u2022\nThis time has also put into light the racial inequalities many people face. For many communities, there\u2019s the issue of accessibility.

Meskipun beberapa gereja sudah dibuka dan menerapkan protokol kesehatan, saya sendiri tetap menahan diri. Stres? Banget. Stres tingkat dewa.

Yeah, I'm agree!\n\nSaya mau ulas kembali selama #IbadahDirumahAja yang pada waktu itu kesulitan jaringan, sound system gk kedengaran tanpa menggunakan perangkat. Kita sudah tahu bahwa segala perayaan ibadah harus terwakilkan teknologi ditengah pandemi desease. Percikan air suci pun harus mengandalkan internet. Salam damai pun via digital, seakan-akan menghilangkan bagian terpenting Misa itu sendiri. Yah, mungkin inilah yang dimaksud dengan manfaat teknologi positif. Hikmat? TIDAK.\n\nTapi teman-teman sy tidak bisa menganggap kendala tadi semua orang mengalaminya, tapi alangkah kita berpikir didalan suatu wilayah yang terdiri dari beberapa daerah sy yakin banyak orang yang tidak ibadah selama pandemi. Misalnya dikampung sy, kemaren nelfon mama bahwa mereka tidak bisa ibadah baik digerja maupun streaming sebelum New Normal diberlakukan. Tapi kalau sekarang sudah.\n\nSy jadi teringat dengan isi buku favorit sy HOMO DEUS karya Yuval Noah Harari tentang sebuah wabah yang menyerang dalan suatu wilayah, dia mengatakan epidemi yg tidak terkendali bukan karena alasan kemarahan ilahi, itu karna manusia yg tidak kompeten. Jadi teman-teman harus tetap mematuhi peraturan protokol kesehatan yaah.. \n\nKarena Yuval juga menegaskan sangat mungkin epidemi besar akan terus membahayakan umat manusia pada masa depan hanya jika manusia sendiri yg menciptakannya, demi kepentingan ideologi yang kejam.\n\nFoto diambil sebelum pandemi.\nHastag pendukung:\n#covid19 #pandemic2020 #ibadahdirumah #ibadahdirumahaja #pandemicdesease #rindugereja #rindugerejabareng #homodeus #yuvalnoahharari","NumberOfLikes":69,"Hashtags":["#IbadahDirumahAja","#covid19","#pandemic2020","#ibadahdirumah","#ibadahdirumahaja","#pandemicdesease","#rindugereja","#rindugerejabareng","#homodeus","#yuvalnoahharari"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Tito on July 27, 2020.

Our students, teachers, and administrators face SERIOUS health risks as they return to the classroom. This is reality is only weeks away and our community is working frantically to pull together much needed resources. As the state asks our schools to reduce class sizes, increase hygiene and cleaning procedures, trace cases, closely monitor the health of students and staff, and offer more remote learning resources, they\u2019re also planning funding cuts. Arkansas faces a $354 Million funding shortfall this year, and this will be made up, in part, by a $30.8 Million cut to the Public School Fund. Low-income students face a school year fraught by loss (they\u2019re among those most likely to have lost a family member due to COVID), strained by economic hardship, and burdened by real and urgent health risks. Now is the time to step up and help our schools. It\u2019s clear that our teachers will not be receiving the support they require from our state government, and the alternative is a unified community push to support our students, teachers, and public schools.

We wanted to share with you her efforts in combating the pandemic in our community. üí™üèº\nIn June, Lori joined a national charity organization, Auntie Sewing Squad, @auntiesewing. ASS is not a business, it is a driven by your community for all communities, especially the ones who need it most where our government has failed to provide assistance. Lori became inspired by the charity\u2019s goals and values and got to work. \u201CI started sewing for all my family, neighbors, friends, high school alumni, gardeners, housekeepers, you name it. I burned through all of my own stash of fabric, my mothers stash shipped from Washington state and, finally, I made a mask out of fabric my grandmother had left. It was the last piece I had that she had touched. I shipped it free of charge to someone I have not heard from in years. Soon, I was churning out 25 masks a day once I started paying for fabric from Amazon.\u201D \nShe joined ASS because they are strong, fearless individuals not afraid to speak for the voiceless, walk with our grandchildren to protest and hold each other\u2019s hands on bad days. \u201CTruly, these are amazing humans and I am so proud to be part of this.\u201D Locally, Lori operates under Grandma Sewing Squad. \u201CI founded the Grandma Sewing Squad noticing that local needs were not being filled. I started with 2 neighbors, both in their 80s. One of them took her valances down and we made masks and mailed them anonymously to a deserving group.\u201D\nLori\u2019s squad in Jacksonville has grown since that day and their work spans beyond just masks. \n\u201CI do not know how many women sew for Grandma\u2019s here in Jacksonville. And, that\u2019s the idea. Many of them come from red hat backgrounds, some are ashamed of their previous actions, some want to make a difference but, do not know how. I show them how, I feed them fabric and supplies, I talk endlessly to them on the phone. But, mostly, I am just kind them. They make masks for children and I help get them delivered to those who need them. I protect their identities so they don\u2019t have to hear negative remarks.\u201D","NumberOfLikes":18,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1595873926,"LocalDate":"Mon Jul 27 20:18:46 CEST 2020","Location":"Shampoo Cut & Color Studio"},{"Owner":"sim.es","CaptionText":"Evenimente online cu ga»ôca noastrƒÉ! \nLa camasa, aranjat, parfumat si cu cea mai buna atitudine! @alecu.victor \n\n#atitudineaconteaza #pandemic2020 #happymoments #happycommunity","NumberOfLikes":36,"Hashtags":["#atitudineaconteaza","#pandemic2020","#happymoments","#happycommunity"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Simona Alecu on July 27, 2020.

Drive-by birthday parades are now the craze and have become a safe way to provide special birthday greetings to those we care about. We were invited to participate in a drive-by 18th birthday parade for Avery, who swims on my daughter\u2019s Special Olympics swim team. One parent organized the parade and a call out to mail birthday cards to Avery. Another parent orchestrated the installation of birthday signage in Avery\u2019s front yard. Excitement mounted as cars lined up around the corner from Avery\u2019s house last Thursday and balloons and other decorations were secured to vehicles. As the parade began and cars approached Avery\u2019s house, horns blew, people shouted greetings, and homemade signs were waved out open windows. As we approached, my eyes filled with tears as I saw Avery\u2019s radiant smile and obvious excitement. It was a poignant moment because on July 7th, the day before her 18th birthday, Avery lost her father to cancer. Avery\u2019s drive-by parade was not only a celebration of her milestone birthday but also a symbol of the power of a loving community and what transpires when people come together to support each other.\n#drivebyparade #18thbirthday #coronavirus #powerofcommunity #pandemic2020 #lifeatsixfeet","NumberOfLikes":36,"Hashtags":["#drivebyparade","#18thbirthday","#coronavirus","#powerofcommunity","#pandemic2020","#lifeatsixfeet"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1595871443,"LocalDate":"Mon Jul 27 19:37:23 CEST 2020","Location":"Brookhaven, Georgia"},{"Owner":"wholesale_market.inc","CaptionText":"ONE TIME DEALS\n\n3 LAYER MASK WITH FILTER AND NOSE PIN \n\nCOLOURS =6-7 AVAILABILIE\n\nMIN ORDER=1000 PIECES\n\n*RATE=13\/-*ü•∞\n\nBOOK FAST  WE HAVE ONLY 5000 PIECE LEFT \n\nLESS THAN 1000 NOT POSSIBLE\n\n #coronamasksale #coronamasken #coronamaskssoldout #coronamasker #maskerwajah #coronamaskonline #facemask #pandemiccooking #coronamaskchallenge #coronamask #coronavirusoutbreak #pandemicpreparedness #coronamasküò∑ #pandemic #helpme #pandemiclife #pandemic2020 #coronavirus  #coronatime #coronamasksforsale #coronapandemic #mask #help #coronaviruspandemic #pandemicovid19 #pandemicart #coronamasksewing #corona #coronamaskmaking #coronamask2020\n@coronaviruss\n@comfy_cotton_masks \n@corona_safety_items \n@corona_nurse_us_reality \n@corona \n@_designer_mask_ \n@maskkingcancun","NumberOfLikes":25,"Hashtags":["#coronamasksale","#coronamasken","#coronamaskssoldout","#coronamasker","#maskerwajah","#coronamaskonline","#facemask","#pandemiccooking","#coronamaskchallenge","#coronamask","#coronavirusoutbreak","#pandemicpreparedness","#coronamasküò∑","#pandemic","#helpme","#pandemiclife","#pandemic2020","#coronavirus","#coronatime","#coronamasksforsale","#coronapandemic","#mask","#help","#coronaviruspandemic","#pandemicovid19","#pandemicart","#coronamasksewing","#corona","#coronamaskmaking","#coronamask2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1595871417,"LocalDate":"Mon Jul 27 19:36:57 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"maskforlife__","CaptionText":"Different designs available to suit all needs.

After her selection, Saudi Health Ministry officials came to her home and tested her for the COVID-19 virus.\n\nShe was then given an electronic bracelet that monitors her movement and told to quarantine for several days at home.\n\nAfter that, Daud was moved to a hotel in Mecca, where she remains in self-isolation, still wearing the electronic wristband. A large box of food is delivered to her hotel room three times a day as she prepares to begin the hajj.\n\nIt was unbelievable. It felt surreal because I was not expecting to get it,\u201D she said of her excitement when she found out she was selected. Daud said she\u2019s praying for the end of COVID-19 and for unity among Muslims around the world.\n\nI am confident that safety measures are being taken and that the only thing that we need to do as pilgrims is follow instructions, and try our best to support each other,\u201D she said.\n\n@newsblogchannel \n#covid19outbreak #pandemic2020 #covid19pandemic #prilaga #covid19news #pandemic #saudiarabianews #hajj2020 #saudiarabia #coviÃád19  #covid19 #hajj #coronavirus","NumberOfLikes":4,"Hashtags":["#covid19outbreak","#pandemic2020","#covid19pandemic","#prilaga","#covid19news","#pandemic","#saudiarabianews","#hajj2020","#saudiarabia","#coviÃád19","#covid19","#hajj","#coronavirus"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Newsblogchannel in Hyderabad.

Our kids are learning resilience and adaptability, traits that will help them in their futures as we support them.\n3.  Everyone is doing the best they can.  Give GRACE to those around you as they navigate the new \u201Cnormal\u201D and the challenges that it represents as we all just want what is best for our families.  Listen.
