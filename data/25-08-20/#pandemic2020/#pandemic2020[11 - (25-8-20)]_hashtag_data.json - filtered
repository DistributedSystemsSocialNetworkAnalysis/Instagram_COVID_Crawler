It was stunning. I ate cheeseburgers sitting on a curb downtown, watching businesses barricade their doors while tourists in little Italy snapped pictures. It was March 16th. \n\nThere is an underlying frequency lately of how we\u2019re all supposed to act the same. We\u2019re all supposed to give a fuck about the company profit margins despite tremendous fear of an invisible deadly virus, and discuss things like traffic, taxes, makeup, when we can get our nails done and when we can book a trip. It\u2019s all noise. \n\nMost of my adult life I\u2019ve had to keep my hair certain colors so I would look a certain way for a job. I\u2019ve decided to cancel that. \n\nMy hair is a mess, my life and career are not. Something shifted for me when everything shut down. Like I need to suck it up and make my own job because any structure in place working for someone else is not safe or reliable. I\u2019ve worked too hard to heal my overall being to operate with that kind of fear and uncertainty. \n\nSo anyway.

El miedo no cabe en la libertad y solo la libertad te hará caber en todos los espacios ilimitados para crear movimiento y arte. El conocimiento NO es poder, la ACCION si. Si te quedas únicamente en el estudio de cierta información, técnica, metodología, modo o manera, el mundo rodara por encima de ti, y en situaciones como esta nueva normalidad, si no te adaptas, si no te MUEVES el mundo se adaptara sin ti. \n.\nAprende, acciona, activate y crea. 👈🏼 esta pequeña formula me ha ayudado a levantarme un sin fin de veces durante esta pandemia.

Therefore, Typically Indian has come up with some common safety tips that can safeguard you from the pandemic coronavirus disease (COVID-19). \n.\n.\n.\n▶️ One of the most effective preventive coronavirus tips can be practicing social distancing. You must maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who have issues of cough or are sneezing.\n▶️ Boosting your immune system can really help you here; with fresh food like veggies and fruits, involving oneself in indoor exercises, intake of essential nutrients like Vitamin B12 with Methylcobalamin, Magnesium, Minerals, Vitamin C, etc. For coronavirus prevention, many basic tasty drinks have immune friendly and healthy ingredients in them like turmeric, lemon, and ginger.\n▶️ Regularly cleaning and disinfecting the surfaces that are frequently touched, such as phones, tablets, remotes, fridges, etc. is an effective way for coronavirus prevention.\n▶️ You must cover your mouth or nose while sneezing or coughing using a tissue. Spread awareness among people around you to maintain respiratory hygiene. If a tissue is not available, you may sneeze or cough into your elbows and wash hands immediately.\n▶️ According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, you must wash your hands at least for 20 seconds thoroughly with any liquid hand wash or soap throughout the day in small intervals. \n\nFollowing these easy but highly effective tips, you can create a barrier between yourself and the disease.....\n#staysafe #guwahatifoodstories #staypositive #keepcalm #pandemic2020 #covid19","NumberOfLikes":7,"Hashtags":["#staysafe","#guwahatifoodstories","#staypositive","#keepcalm","#pandemic2020","#covid19"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Typically Indian on July 29, 2020 tagging @geeta_4u, @myfooddiary_guwahati, @foodieforeverandever23, @goodfoodghy, @toppings_of_love, @guwahatifoodtales, @guwahati.edibletreats, @food_around_the_world_____, @guwahati_food_blogger, @foogersguwahati, @tingleyourtastebudswith, and @food.travel.health.

I'm Amber, a clinical therapist with experience working with children and their families. @connectwithplay is a place to come for caregiver\/parent advice, support and inspiration. \n\nOur children are struggling. Play is like medicine. \n\nFree play is classified as unstructured and undirected play which is led by the child\u2019s imagination. It is an enormous force, which enhances so many facets of their development. Most importantly, free play helps to release negative energy and hard to name feelings in children, has the ability to help children to gain a sense of mastery over a problem and gives them back the power they may have lost. If I could describe it so that adults could relate, play provides children with the same feeling as an adult would have after a massage - restored, rejuvenated and calm.\n\nThe difficulty we face is this, how can we encourage it when our child is pulled in so many directions by technology, structured activities and television?\n\nChildren will only engage in free play, which can ultimately be healing and restorative, when they are not distracted and when they feel emotionally safe to do so. Hopefully you find this post helpful in promoting free play with your little. \n\nHow do you encourage free play at home??

Dr Immanuel\u2019s dataset contains 350 of her patients that survived COVID while on this drug. \n.\nHer data set is already skewed by the nature of her patient population. She works at a walk-in clinic in a strip mall. Not a hospital. So she is clearly not seeing the sickest patients requiring oxygen, ventilation, or ECMO. \n.\nSecond, there is no placebo arm, which already negates her non-published  anecdotal experience as being less than level A evidence (the best evidence to prove causality with an intervention.) These are achieved by performing double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCT). The largest RCT to date on hydroxychloroquine is out of the UK where of 1542 hospitalized patients treated with hydroxychloroquine, 25.7% had died after 28 days, compared with 23.5% in a group of 3132 patients who had only received standard care. \u201CThese data convincingly rule out any meaningful mortality benefit,\u201D. \n.\nNext to the prophylactic benefits. Dr. Immanuel claims that all her staff are on hydroxychloroquine and none have contracted COVID, thereby proving its benefit. Her staff in a walk-in clinic likely caps at 10 or so people. How much are we going to hang our hat on that data? My entire block of families (30 people plus) are NOT on hydroxychloroquine and none of us have contracted COVID. We have 6 physicians on the block and none of the staff in our respective clinics have contracted COVID either. So...that claim doesn\u2019t hold water.\n.\nLastly, she claims because some in vitro (pitri dish) study back in 2005 on a DIFFERENT coronavirus showed benefit with hydroxychloroquine to kill the virus, that this somehow would translate to meaningful human data on an entirely novel coronavirus.

When 2020 is over, I want to look back and see all the reasons I should be thankful rather than only focusing on things I don\u2019t have or didn\u2019t do. I want to look back and see that I was content with where 2020 brought me. I want to trust in God\u2019s timing and not worry about my plans I create for myself.\u201D\n\nI found this little journal entry snippet yesterday and it made me laugh out loud at just how relatable it\u2019s turned out to be. I\u2019ve always been a planner, and when I laid out the year before me in my head, I certainly didn\u2019t predict the majority of what 2020 has thrown my way. I recognized early on that, while my type-A, super-planner personality has a time and a place (and I\u2019ve come to accept that this is just a part of who I am), it isn\u2019t exactly an end all, be all in every aspect of life- and 2020 didn\u2019t take long to really smack me square in the face with this hard truth. Thank goodness I made it a goal early on this year to not dwell on my own plans, but to trust in His plan- which has not always been easy.\n\nFlashback to St. Patrick\u2019s day: Derrick is temporarily laid off due to the pandemic and that same night I decided to take a pregnancy test, never believing it would be positive. Surprise!! God had a way of teaching us to trust in his divine plan, and 2020 sure has been my year to learn this lesson. \n\nWith all the challenges we\u2019ve faced, we are still so blessed to be bringing a little boy into the world this November. I\u2019ll look back on this year as the one that gave me my greatest blessing in life, rather than dwell on all the uncertainty 2020 brought with it. I might have a lot to worry about this year, but at the end of the day, God had a plan for me and our growing family, and it\u2019s okay that it didn\u2019t perfectly line up with how I thought 2020 would go. 2020 has come with a lot of craziness, but man: it\u2019s bringing a heck of lot of joy my way too. ❤️ little man, your parents are so lucky to have you!","NumberOfLikes":23,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by MORGAN | Raising Baby Z on July 28, 2020.","NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1595994304,"LocalDate":"Wed Jul 29 05:45:04 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"lucho_audio","CaptionText":"Con @malyjorquiera \nSeguimos trabajando para usted.\n#julio2020 #chilegram #santiagodechile #instagram #pandemia2020 #tvdecalidad #sonido #shure #pic #trabajando #trabajandoparausted #late #lateshow #chile #instachile #audio #shuremicrophones #sennheiser #covid19 #pandemia #pandemic2020 #canal13 #sigamosdelargo13\nPhoto by @ordenes_sergio","NumberOfLikes":12,"Hashtags":["#julio2020","#chilegram","#santiagodechile","#instagram","#pandemia2020","#tvdecalidad","#sonido","#shure","#pic","#trabajando","#trabajandoparausted","#late","#lateshow","#chile","#instachile","#audio","#shuremicrophones","#sennheiser","#covid19","#pandemia","#pandemic2020","#canal13","#sigamosdelargo13"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Luis Rojas O. in Canal 13.

During this crisis, if you have been diagnosed COVID positive and completely recovered, you can specifically donate your plasma with COVID antibodies, called convalescent plasma donation (takes a little bit longer than typical whole blood donation).\n~\nLook for local blood drives in your community through the American Red Cross or The Blood Connection (in partnership with MUSC).

With the news breaking of these doctor there is an attempt to keep our nation in this state of fear and hysteria by the left for political reasons. But I prophesied that there would be an exposure and we are seeing it. Pray with me that Facebook and Twitter would not be able to silence these doctors. \n\nVision of Covid-19 Exposure \n\nWhile standing in line getting some things for the house, I saw had a vision and saw the words \u201CExposed\u201D hanging in the air. I began to ask the Lord what he meant and he began to share some things with me. First, I believe Covid-19 is a real threat and I have compassion on those that have gotten sick or even died. But there is a attempt by some of those in power to make this virus look worst than it is. One way I saw them doing this is through hospitals being told to forge numbers to make Covid outbreaks appear worst than it actually is. I saw hospital scandals in which certain hospitals get called out for not accurately reporting information. These things will be exposed before the end of year, and many will be very surprised.\n\nWhy, you might ask, would they do this? Simple! To keep the economy weakened, to push their agendas, and to make a Donald Trump look bad. To make it look like he, and others mayors and governors, are stupid for reopening the economy. This is about keeping the economy weak so Trump can\u2019t use the amazing numbers we were seeing of record employment and things like this to run on.

Hi everyone, this is just a gentle reminder that we are still facing a health pandemic. In the US, there have been over 4 million cases of Covid-19, of which, 146,546 have resulted in death to date. [CDC statistics updated today 7\/28\/20] This is very serious and utterly heartbreaking. 💔💔\n✨\n\nPlease continue practicing all safety precautions including wearing a mask or some kind of protective face covering when you go out, practice social distancing from others, wash your hands and refrain from making extraneous trips.\n✨\n\nRemember that health pandemics will always hit the most marginalized the hardest. Black Americans are hospitalized with Covid-19 at higher rates than other ethnic or racial groups. [Pew Research Center] Taking safety precautions means we are also protecting the most marginalized groups.\n✨\n\nSevere physical-health illnesses can be quite traumatic and so self-protection and the protection of our fellow humans is trauma-prevention, thus trauma-informed.\n✨\n\nIf you\u2019ve contracted and are sick with Covid-19 I am wishing you good health and a speedy recovery. If a loved one has contracted and is sick from Covid, I am wishing them health and a speedy recovery too.\n✨\n\nIf you\u2019re struggling with sheltering-in-place, if you feel bored, anxious, stressed, starved for human contact, depressed, angry, helpless or in despair, I see you. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this. It is completely understandable that you\u2019re feeling this way. This whole pandemic is tragic and scary, and in the US, it\u2019s also not being handled well which only adds to the stress. Sending you virtual support.\n✨\n\nPS - Please check out the \u201Chotlines\u201D highlight, contact a mental health professional or go to your nearest emergency room if you are unsafe sheltering-in-place or experiencing a mental health crisis.\n✨","NumberOfLikes":986,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Laura Mohai, teacher, advocate in Los Angeles, California.

The government has opened  a new section of the municipal cemetery expanded for graves of those suspected of dying from COVID-19.\nMany new graves have appeared there over the last several weeks.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#myqbb #quarantinebeyondborders #everydaycovid #everydayindonesia #everydayjakarta #covidphotodiaries #covidphotography #covidphoto #icpconcerned #photojournalism #photojournalist #fotoperiodismo #fotoperiodista #photojournalisme #fotoperiodisme #massisolationformat #newnormal2020 #newnormal #washyourhands #socialdistancing2020 #socialjustice #everydaysocialjustice #everydaysoutheastasia #documentaryphotography #reporter #reportagespotlight #storytellingphotography #storytellingphotographer #covidstories #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":182,"Hashtags":["#myqbb","#quarantinebeyondborders","#everydaycovid","#everydayindonesia","#everydayjakarta","#covidphotodiaries","#covidphotography","#covidphoto","#icpconcerned","#photojournalism","#photojournalist","#fotoperiodismo","#fotoperiodista","#photojournalisme","#fotoperiodisme","#massisolationformat","#newnormal2020","#newnormal","#washyourhands","#socialdistancing2020","#socialjustice","#everydaysocialjustice","#everydaysoutheastasia","#documentaryphotography","#reporter","#reportagespotlight","#storytellingphotography","#storytellingphotographer","#covidstories","#pandemic2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1595936319,"LocalDate":"Tue Jul 28 13:38:39 CEST 2020","Location":"Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"Owner":"sewnaturalks","CaptionText":"Terrific Tuesday\u2019s need early morning giggles 😆🤪 #sewnaturalks #quiltersofinstagram #quiltingismytherapy #pandemic2020 #laughteramust","NumberOfLikes":26,"Hashtags":["#sewnaturalks","#quiltersofinstagram","#quiltingismytherapy","#pandemic2020","#laughteramust"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Charlotte's Sew Natural in Charlotte's Sew Natural.

If these needs are not met they can impact greatly on our mental and physical health.\n\n🔸️BASIC NEEDS\n\n* Our basic needs are all needs below self-actualisation.\n* If you're focused on meeting your basic needs, you may feel fear, anxiety and depression.\n* Maslow believed that basic human needs can be fulfilled only through other human beings. If this is the case, then these needs are not being met during the current pandemic.\n\n🔹️PHYSIOLOGICAL NEEDS\n\n* Everyone has physiological needs. \n* We need food, air and water to survive.\n* When we need food we eat. If we do not have food, we become anxious and distressed.\n* This is very real for a lot of people right now all around the world due to job loss and panic buying.\n\n🔸️ SAFETY NEEDS\n\n* To fulfil our most basic safety needs, we need a roof over our head, job security and family love.\n* If we do not have enough money to pay for bills and to feed our families, then our safety needs are not being met.\n* Multiple Australians and many others across the globe have lost their jobs due to COVID-19; this means there is a real possibility that many people are not having there safety needs met.\n\n🔹️ LOVE AND BELONGING NEEDS\n\n* For our love and belonging needs to be met, we need to feel love and support from our loved ones. We need to feel like we are wanted, and that we belong.\n* A lot of immediate families are together, feeling loved. However, just as many are separated from their loved ones or trapped in violent homes - deprived of any love.\n\n🔸️🔹️🔸️ IN CONTRAST\n\n* Maslow also believed it was important to deal with life's ups and downs from a growth mindset. That is, looking at stressful and challenging times as opportunities for growth, rather than feeling defeated.\n* For this reason, we need to look at this huge impacting moment in our lives as an opportunity to discover the inner strength that we never knew existed. ❤❤❤💪🧠\n\n#mentalhealth #depression #anxiety #mentalhealthpandemic #abrahammaslow #growthmindset #pandemic2020 #covid19 #needs #family #humantouch #safety #psychologystudent #psychology #hardtimes","NumberOfLikes":9,"Hashtags":["#mentalhealth","#depression","#anxiety","#mentalhealthpandemic","#abrahammaslow","#growthmindset","#pandemic2020","#covid19","#needs","#family","#humantouch","#safety","#psychologystudent","#psychology","#hardtimes"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Eloise Meyer on July 28, 2020.

Here are some takeaways:\n\n1. BFYT in lieu of BYOB - Bag From Your Trunk instead of Bring Your Own Bag. Stores here in CA will not allow use of your reusable bags in stores but you can let them know that you have your own. They\u2019ll put your groceries back into the cart sans bags and you can bag them with your own from your trunk.\n2. Reusing to-go containers from ordering in (we definitely did this when we needed to take a break from cooking). I\u2019ve put them to good use by storing washed veggies and fruits in them. They actually have more capacity than my usual containers. I\u2019ve also used them for transferring mulch\/soil in the garden and storage for Joseph\u2019s toys since a few of his storage bags went missing.\n3. Decrease use of plastic\/extraneous packaging with online orders like Instacart and food takeout by making clear requests in the comment section like: -No plastic produce bags.\n-Use paper-bags with all groceries and consolidate please.\n-No condiments, utensils, or napkins please. \n4. Toilet paper rolls are great when cut\/shredded and put in compost bin since many have started their victory garden since the pandemic. It\u2019s also great for arts & crafts for your young ones. \n5. Reusing glass jars have been great during this hot summer for catching bugs like spiders around the house. I\u2019ve caught about 5-8 and let them free in the yard. They\u2019ve also been great vessels for DIY essential oil based products (check out my DIY EO highlight), homemade sauces\/food, and for propagating plants.\n\u2022\nThis time has also put into light the racial inequalities many people face. For many communities, there\u2019s the issue of accessibility. Many people live in food deserts where fresh whole food is lacking and tree deserts where there\u2019s more concrete than there are trees to shade them and help clean the air....(continued in comments)","NumberOfLikes":43,"Hashtags":["#plasticfreejuly"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by K A R R E N on July 27, 2020.","NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1595915407,"LocalDate":"Tue Jul 28 07:50:07 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"scoopwhoopunscripted","CaptionText":"\"If you have to survive in the pandemic, you need to have connections with a specific class.

Meskipun beberapa gereja sudah dibuka dan menerapkan protokol kesehatan, saya sendiri tetap menahan diri. Stres? Banget. Stres tingkat dewa. Karena orang bilang, stres itu bukan disebabkan kurang piknik tapi kurang ibadaha. Yeah, I'm agree!\n\nSaya mau ulas kembali selama #IbadahDirumahAja yang pada waktu itu kesulitan jaringan, sound system gk kedengaran tanpa menggunakan perangkat. Kita sudah tahu bahwa segala perayaan ibadah harus terwakilkan teknologi ditengah pandemi desease. Percikan air suci pun harus mengandalkan internet. Salam damai pun via digital, seakan-akan menghilangkan bagian terpenting Misa itu sendiri. Yah, mungkin inilah yang dimaksud dengan manfaat teknologi positif. Hikmat? TIDAK.\n\nTapi teman-teman sy tidak bisa menganggap kendala tadi semua orang mengalaminya, tapi alangkah kita berpikir didalan suatu wilayah yang terdiri dari beberapa daerah sy yakin banyak orang yang tidak ibadah selama pandemi. Misalnya dikampung sy, kemaren nelfon mama bahwa mereka tidak bisa ibadah baik digerja maupun streaming sebelum New Normal diberlakukan. Tapi kalau sekarang sudah.\n\nSy jadi teringat dengan isi buku favorit sy HOMO DEUS karya Yuval Noah Harari tentang sebuah wabah yang menyerang dalan suatu wilayah, dia mengatakan epidemi yg tidak terkendali bukan karena alasan kemarahan ilahi, itu karna manusia yg tidak kompeten. Jadi teman-teman harus tetap mematuhi peraturan protokol kesehatan yaah.. \n\nKarena Yuval juga menegaskan sangat mungkin epidemi besar akan terus membahayakan umat manusia pada masa depan hanya jika manusia sendiri yg menciptakannya, demi kepentingan ideologi yang kejam.\n\nFoto diambil sebelum pandemi.\nHastag pendukung:\n#covid19 #pandemic2020 #ibadahdirumah #ibadahdirumahaja #pandemicdesease #rindugereja #rindugerejabareng #homodeus #yuvalnoahharari","NumberOfLikes":69,"Hashtags":["#IbadahDirumahAja","#covid19","#pandemic2020","#ibadahdirumah","#ibadahdirumahaja","#pandemicdesease","#rindugereja","#rindugerejabareng","#homodeus","#yuvalnoahharari"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Tito on July 27, 2020.

Bavithra, was seconded to the Covid team at the hospital. Bavithra was born in Sri Lanka and relocated to the UK with her parents when she was two. \u201CWe were determined to keep delivering the core services at The Wolverton- throughout the pandemic, we had a duty of care to the most vulnerable people to make sure they could still access services. As a leader it was important to check in on the team whilst also making sure I could support the Covid team; it was a hard time for all of us. I'm so proud of our team at The Wolverton. They worked so hard and I'm in awe of my colleagues on the Covid team; it will be a time in my life that I'll never forget.\" I was so impressed by Bavithra. Honestly, she's one hard working woman. A mother to three girls, the lead consultant at an incredibly busy clinic and also in the process of studying for a Masters. I came away from the shoot inspired. She's truly focussed on realising her potential, all whilst simultaneously ensuring the standard of care her and her team offer is the best it can be. \n\n#inkingston #portrait #london #photography  #portraitphotography #socialdocumentary #documentaryphotography #femalephotographer #cameramama #coronavirus #thelifestylecollective #londonphotographer #naturallightportrait #surreyphotographer #richmonduponthames #femaledoctor #pandemic2020 #nhs #nhsheroes @nhs #surrey #kingstonuponthames  #pandemicportraits #documentaryphotography @newjournalistmagazine #massisolationformat #wearedistanttogether #joybehindthesquares @essentialsurrey #doctorsofinstagram #doctor #fortheloveofthephotograph #dearphotographer #phlocklive","NumberOfLikes":65,"Hashtags":["#inkingston","#portrait","#london","#photography","#portraitphotography","#socialdocumentary","#documentaryphotography","#femalephotographer","#cameramama","#coronavirus","#thelifestylecollective","#londonphotographer","#naturallightportrait","#surreyphotographer","#richmonduponthames","#femaledoctor","#pandemic2020","#nhs","#nhsheroes","#surrey","#kingstonuponthames","#pandemicportraits","#documentaryphotography","#massisolationformat","#wearedistanttogether","#joybehindthesquares","#doctorsofinstagram","#doctor","#fortheloveofthephotograph","#dearphotographer","#phlocklive"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":6,"Timestamp":1595913540,"LocalDate":"Tue Jul 28 07:19:00 CEST 2020","Location":"Kingston upon Thames"},{"Owner":"swan_kwee","CaptionText":"Spain has been declared safe for tourists by Foreign Minister Arancha González Laya.

Our students, teachers, and administrators face SERIOUS health risks as they return to the classroom. This is reality is only weeks away and our community is working frantically to pull together much needed resources. As the state asks our schools to reduce class sizes, increase hygiene and cleaning procedures, trace cases, closely monitor the health of students and staff, and offer more remote learning resources, they\u2019re also planning funding cuts. Arkansas faces a $354 Million funding shortfall this year, and this will be made up, in part, by a $30.8 Million cut to the Public School Fund. Low-income students face a school year fraught by loss (they\u2019re among those most likely to have lost a family member due to COVID), strained by economic hardship, and burdened by real and urgent health risks. Now is the time to step up and help our schools. It\u2019s clear that our teachers will not be receiving the support they require from our state government, and the alternative is a unified community push to support our students, teachers, and public schools. Help a teacher friend by asking what supplies they need and making those available.

We wanted to share with you her efforts in combating the pandemic in our community. 💪🏼\nIn June, Lori joined a national charity organization, Auntie Sewing Squad, @auntiesewing. ASS is not a business, it is a driven by your community for all communities, especially the ones who need it most where our government has failed to provide assistance. Lori became inspired by the charity\u2019s goals and values and got to work. \u201CI started sewing for all my family, neighbors, friends, high school alumni, gardeners, housekeepers, you name it. I burned through all of my own stash of fabric, my mothers stash shipped from Washington state and, finally, I made a mask out of fabric my grandmother had left. It was the last piece I had that she had touched. I shipped it free of charge to someone I have not heard from in years. Soon, I was churning out 25 masks a day once I started paying for fabric from Amazon.\u201D \nShe joined ASS because they are strong, fearless individuals not afraid to speak for the voiceless, walk with our grandchildren to protest and hold each other\u2019s hands on bad days. \u201CTruly, these are amazing humans and I am so proud to be part of this.\u201D Locally, Lori operates under Grandma Sewing Squad. \u201CI founded the Grandma Sewing Squad noticing that local needs were not being filled. I started with 2 neighbors, both in their 80s. One of them took her valances down and we made masks and mailed them anonymously to a deserving group.\u201D\nLori\u2019s squad in Jacksonville has grown since that day and their work spans beyond just masks. \n\u201CI do not know how many women sew for Grandma\u2019s here in Jacksonville. And, that\u2019s the idea. Many of them come from red hat backgrounds, some are ashamed of their previous actions, some want to make a difference but, do not know how. I show them how, I feed them fabric and supplies, I talk endlessly to them on the phone. But, mostly, I am just kind them. They make masks for children and I help get them delivered to those who need them.

But this is the deal and I will say it louder for the people in the back!\n\n👉🏻It\u2019s not about \u201Ctime management\u201D it\u2019s about managing ourselves.\n\nThe key is to be proactive and to prioritize because life is always gonna get messy!\n\nWhat\u2019s the alternative? \n\nTo stay angry, beaten down and unfulfilled? NOT A CHANCE\n\nIf I am going to go through life\u2019s stressors then I want to be the healthiest version of me. That means finding balance in life and having goals. The results are priceless❤️\n\n#fitness\n#goals\n#fitmomma\n#pandemic2020\n#yougotthis\n#fitover40\n#igotyourback\n#coaching\n#personaltrainerwinstonsalem","NumberOfLikes":26,"Hashtags":["#fitness","#goals","#fitmomma","#pandemic2020","#yougotthis","#fitover40","#igotyourback","#coaching","#personaltrainerwinstonsalem"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Christina Barrett on July 27, 2020.

Drive-by birthday parades are now the craze and have become a safe way to provide special birthday greetings to those we care about. We were invited to participate in a drive-by 18th birthday parade for Avery, who swims on my daughter\u2019s Special Olympics swim team. One parent organized the parade and a call out to mail birthday cards to Avery. Another parent orchestrated the installation of birthday signage in Avery\u2019s front yard. Excitement mounted as cars lined up around the corner from Avery\u2019s house last Thursday and balloons and other decorations were secured to vehicles. As the parade began and cars approached Avery\u2019s house, horns blew, people shouted greetings, and homemade signs were waved out open windows. As we approached, my eyes filled with tears as I saw Avery\u2019s radiant smile and obvious excitement. It was a poignant moment because on July 7th, the day before her 18th birthday, Avery lost her father to cancer. Avery\u2019s drive-by parade was not only a celebration of her milestone birthday but also a symbol of the power of a loving community and what transpires when people come together to support each other.\n#drivebyparade #18thbirthday #coronavirus #powerofcommunity #pandemic2020 #lifeatsixfeet","NumberOfLikes":36,"Hashtags":["#drivebyparade","#18thbirthday","#coronavirus","#powerofcommunity","#pandemic2020","#lifeatsixfeet"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1595871443,"LocalDate":"Mon Jul 27 19:37:23 CEST 2020","Location":"Brookhaven, Georgia"},{"Owner":"wholesale_market.inc","CaptionText":"ONE TIME DEALS\n\n3 LAYER MASK WITH FILTER AND NOSE PIN \n\nCOLOURS =6-7 AVAILABILIE\n\nMIN ORDER=1000 PIECES\n\n*RATE=13\/-*🥰\n\nBOOK FAST  WE HAVE ONLY 5000 PIECE LEFT \n\nLESS THAN 1000 NOT POSSIBLE\n\n #coronamasksale #coronamasken #coronamaskssoldout #coronamasker #maskerwajah #coronamaskonline #facemask #pandemiccooking #coronamaskchallenge #coronamask #coronavirusoutbreak #pandemicpreparedness #coronamask😷 #pandemic #helpme #pandemiclife #pandemic2020 #coronavirus  #coronatime #coronamasksforsale #coronapandemic #mask #help #coronaviruspandemic #pandemicovid19 #pandemicart #coronamasksewing #corona #coronamaskmaking #coronamask2020\n@coronaviruss\n@comfy_cotton_masks \n@corona_safety_items \n@corona_nurse_us_reality \n@corona \n@_designer_mask_ \n@maskkingcancun","NumberOfLikes":25,"Hashtags":["#coronamasksale","#coronamasken","#coronamaskssoldout","#coronamasker","#maskerwajah","#coronamaskonline","#facemask","#pandemiccooking","#coronamaskchallenge","#coronamask","#coronavirusoutbreak","#pandemicpreparedness","#coronamask😷","#pandemic","#helpme","#pandemiclife","#pandemic2020","#coronavirus","#coronatime","#coronamasksforsale","#coronapandemic","#mask","#help","#coronaviruspandemic","#pandemicovid19","#pandemicart","#coronamasksewing","#corona","#coronamaskmaking","#coronamask2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1595871417,"LocalDate":"Mon Jul 27 19:36:57 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"maskforlife__","CaptionText":"Different designs available to suit all needs.

Wyjazd ten generalnie był bardzo spontaniczny - od pomysłu do realizacji minęło mniej niż 3 tygodnie, a pojawił się on w momencie, kiedy byłam w drodze w Bieszczady na niesamowite wesele wspaniałych osób. 💒 \nSzczerze mówiąc, przez chwilę obawiałam się jak to się potoczy z obroną - napisałam w sprawie zmiany terminu, lecz harmonogram był już przygotowany, a ja stwierdziłam, że nie będę więcej mieszać i jest to po prostu kolejne wyzwanie, któremu muszę podołać. I nie myliłam się - egzamin oraz praca dyplomowa na 5, co w połączeniu ze średnią z całego toku studiów wynoszącą 4.76 zaskutkowało wystąpieniem przez komisję z wnioskiem o przyznanie wyróżnienia. ✨🏆 \nMiałam wiele chwil zwątpienia podczas ostatniego semestru, który był dla mnie niesamowicie trudny do przejścia chociażby z uwagi na zdalne nauczanie i destabilizację codzienności, jednak warto było zacisnąć zęby - po burzy jest tęcza. 😉🌈 #kozminskiuni #kupride #bachelorthesis #finance #banking #graduate  #success #warsaw #alk #pandemic2020 #nevergiveup @kozminskiuniversity","NumberOfLikes":140,"Hashtags":["#kozminskiuni","#kupride","#bachelorthesis","#finance","#banking","#graduate","#success","#warsaw","#alk","#pandemic2020","#nevergiveup"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":18,"Timestamp":1595869894,"LocalDate":"Mon Jul 27 19:11:34 CEST 2020","Location":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego - Kozminski University"},{"Owner":"covenant.farm","CaptionText":".\nWe keep waiting for life to slip back to that normal place.\nWhen it all breaks loose and going to the store, running in the post office, grabbing a meal out as a family aren\u2019t stressful, confrontational experiences.\n.\nWe keep waiting.\n.\nAnd waiting can bring so much stress.\nAre you feeling it?\nThat build up in your chest?\nThe tension around your head?\n.\nHow are you dealing with it?\n.\nIt takes choices.\nSmall ones, backed by HOPE.\nChoices to breathe deeply.\nRelax every muscle of your face.\nWhisper Truths and Promises that never fade.\nPress into the One who never fails.\n.\nIt takes choices.\nAll day.\nOver and over.\n.\nHow are you doing, friend?","NumberOfLikes":68,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Jen VanderStoep + Family on July 27, 2020.

After her selection, Saudi Health Ministry officials came to her home and tested her for the COVID-19 virus.\n\nShe was then given an electronic bracelet that monitors her movement and told to quarantine for several days at home.\n\nAfter that, Daud was moved to a hotel in Mecca, where she remains in self-isolation, still wearing the electronic wristband. A large box of food is delivered to her hotel room three times a day as she prepares to begin the hajj.\n\nIt was unbelievable. It felt surreal because I was not expecting to get it,\u201D she said of her excitement when she found out she was selected. Daud said she\u2019s praying for the end of COVID-19 and for unity among Muslims around the world.\n\nI am confident that safety measures are being taken and that the only thing that we need to do as pilgrims is follow instructions, and try our best to support each other,\u201D she said.\n\n@newsblogchannel \n#covid19outbreak #pandemic2020 #covid19pandemic #prilaga #covid19news #pandemic #saudiarabianews #hajj2020 #saudiarabia #covi̇d19  #covid19 #hajj #coronavirus","NumberOfLikes":4,"Hashtags":["#covid19outbreak","#pandemic2020","#covid19pandemic","#prilaga","#covid19news","#pandemic","#saudiarabianews","#hajj2020","#saudiarabia","#covi̇d19","#covid19","#hajj","#coronavirus"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Newsblogchannel in Hyderabad.

She sent her son to the bar to formally complain and had him walk me outside when my service was done to ensure my safety. Even though the men were gone it was very thoughtful and compassionate of her. I hugged her and left. She's experienced racism in different environments as well and in this moment what I already knew replayed in my head. It's us against racist. PERIOD! No way around it. All people of color out here catching hell for centuries but sadly we've never stuck together. \u2063\n\u2063\nIn these moments ignorant bigots want a reaction. They're self hating and need that little dick energy to go somewhere. Black women do not engage if you have a choice. U are not a man. Unless u have a weapon to defend your self successfully from an attack do not engage. Call your husbands, boyfriends, brothers, uncles, male cousins, homeboy, ect. It does not make u weak to not react. It makes u smart. The average racist is a coward and cannot handle an even playing field. Shit is real out here and you have to stay ready. Swallow ur pride and put safety first. This was hard for me. Damn near impossible. But I did. If he were in my face directly addressing me I wouldn't have had the wherewithal to not react. \u2063\n\u2063\nI have my concealed carry and have for years. I was unarmed this day. I don't look it but I'm tiny. No match for 3 grown men. \u2063\n\u2063\nI can say my city keeps us pretty insulated from the majority of what I see on TV. I live far from our major city.

Our kids are learning resilience and adaptability, traits that will help them in their futures as we support them.\n3.  Everyone is doing the best they can.
