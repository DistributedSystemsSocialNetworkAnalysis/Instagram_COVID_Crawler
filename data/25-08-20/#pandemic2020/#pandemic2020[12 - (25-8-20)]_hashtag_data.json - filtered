That\u2019s what life is like in Texas.\nIn the midst of this misery, let\u2019s talk about something positive. Let\u2019s talk about masks.\nI love masks. Right now they feel like are like our magic protectors, like holding garlic up in front of Dracula, or wearing a special amulet that keeps the evil eye away.\nOr maybe like wearing a condom and not getting syphilis.\nWhy are masks particularly important with Covid?\nWell, as with Everything Covid, \u201Cwe are building the plane while we fly it.\u201D We are accumulating data as fast as we can and some trends look promising. While some of this may change over time, for now this is what we know.\nFirst off, it appears, unbelievably, that the rate of people who are infected but have no symptoms is around 40% (...)","NumberOfLikes":77,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ✨Seyyide Sultan✨ on July 27, 2020.

We\u2019ve all dealt with Covid-19 in our own ways, no matter where we\u2019ve been in the world. Fears that we were not aware of, situations we were never prepared for, dealing with a threat that was invisible and silent. The fragility of life just became more frail. Not only for me, but for everyone. And in these times, Dettol was a name that was part of my life and my home. The reassurance that these products provided safety for me and my family when used with proper practice, took me a long way. I received this Eid hamper just yesterday and these past 4 months flashed before my eyes. The loss of family members due to the virus, hearing first hand experiences from loved ones, struggling with the ever building anxiety and panic levels, the helplessness... nevertheless, it also took me back to the times of hope, of health, of repeated positive affirmations, of the capabilities we never knew we had to help us fight and get past the craziest of times.

After starting of the new year with a stomach bug on top of pregnancy nausea (thanks to my toddler for that gem), COVID hit and turned the world upside down. \n.\n.\nFor those of us who have been pregnant lately, that\u2019s meant tackling a lot of this pregnancy stuff alone. My husband couldn\u2019t come to the 20 week ultrasound and didn\u2019t even hear the baby\u2019s heartbeat until 31 weeks. My son hasn\u2019t been allowed to a single appointment and won\u2019t be able to visit at the hospital when his sister is born. \n.\n.\nFor me personally, it\u2019s meant being diagnosed with melanoma (yes, as in skin cancer) in the 2nd trimester and being alone while having to get a procedure to remove it- since it was during a time when we were fully quarantining and my husband had to stay home with our son. (Thankfully, it was caught early and the cancer is gone!) It also meant losing a grandparent in the 3rd trimester and not being able to go to the funeral or be with my family because of the number of people that would be there without masks on (on top of the travel to get there.)\n.\n.\nNow, while COVID cases are spiking in our area, my pregnancy is high risk, which means I\u2019m at the doctors and hospital 3x a week for tests and weekly ultrasounds. And I\u2019m terrified of getting COVID prior to getting tested for delivery. \n.\n.\nI share all of this not for sympathy but in case there are others going through similarly weird and challenging things during this pandemic- you\u2019re not alone! ALSO, if I can manage tons of doctor and hospital visits with a mask on- all while having trouble breathing at times because of an excess amount of fluid putting pressure on my lungs- you can wear a mask to buy your groceries without complaining.

Some are struggling to cope, while others want to calm down and get back to business as usual. So, as companies navigate a slow return to ordinary life and work routines, leaders must understand that employees will need varying kinds of support. This is not a time to robotically \u201Ccopy all\u201D with messages about thoughts and prayers, but a time to help each individual with their unique grief. Most of all, it\u2019s important to provide the space for healing by allowing people to feel what they\u2019re going through.\r\n\r\nHere are two approaches to consider when helping employees emerge from the crisis:\r\n\r\nFind the right interventions. Avoid blanket policies; not all employees need the same support. Some may be grieving the loss of normalcy or dealing with anxiety about the future; for them, working might help them balance out their thoughts. Others, like those who have been sick or have cared for sick family members or friends, have gone through a traumatic experience and may need validation or even counseling. Thinking about the different possibilities can help you tailor support to each person\u2019s needs.\r\n\r\nSupport the search for meaning. People may struggle to move on from their grief if they\u2019re having a hard time seeing the purpose behind their pain. But finding meaning doesn\u2019t always happen during a crisis. It could happen in the aftermath and it could come in many forms. For example, remembering the joy that came with something or someone before it was lost could bring meaning. Some may take comfort in expressing gratitude or finding small moments that heal. \r\n\r\nBecause we\u2019re all going through this pandemic together, it\u2019s possible that we may find meaning and heal sooner than we would from most losses. But healing doesn\u2019t mean that the pandemic was worth it or that we\u2019ll forget the damages done \u2014 it means that the damages no longer control our outlook on life.\r\n\u2014\n#pandemic #covid_19#coronavirus\n#eraofpandemic#pandemic2020\n#indiafightscoronavirus#unprecedented\n#crisis#economycrisis#health\n#healthemergency#worldwide#business\n#lifestyle#life#company#job#service","NumberOfLikes":14,"Hashtags":["#Repost","#pandemic","#covid_1","#coronavirus","#eraofpandemi","#pandemic2020","#indiafightscoronaviru","#unprecedented","#crisi","#economycrisi","#health","#healthemergenc","#worldwid","#business","#lifestyl","#lif","#compan","#jo","#service"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Vijay Singh Spartan in Stay Home.
