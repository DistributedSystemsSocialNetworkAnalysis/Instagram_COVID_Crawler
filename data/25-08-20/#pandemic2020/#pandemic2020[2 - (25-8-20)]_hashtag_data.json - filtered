Man...what a city and people #cuscoperú is. I flew into Cusco on March 9th for what was supposed  to be a simple 9 day exploration through Lima, Cusco and Machu Picchu with the lady. The pandemic hit Peru March 17.  That 9 day trek has now turned into 164 days and counting. Quarantined in Cusco for 3.5 months of it under martial law. What a freakin  experience and wild ride this has been. Nothing could have prepared me for it! But...it hasn't come without its sacrifices, however. To get where you want to go and preserve your personal integrity and accountability along the way sometimes sacrifices need to be made. Chances need to be taken, and sometimes decisions might not be in your own best interest and that's okay, because that's part of adulting. Putting people ahead of yourself feels good. It's not always about you. Because sometimes being able to sleep at night and being happy when you wake up knowing you made the right decision outweighs everything anyone could ever want when it comes to finding internal peace and happiness. The more you put people ahead of yourself, the more you'll know and feel your self worth.

I haven\u2019t been consistent because somebody or some animal is usually in need of ALL OF my time. \nI had to make a sacrifice somewhere because I crave working out. It gives me that wonderful release of endorphins. It makes me feel accomplished. It makes me feel strong and healthy and happy. I\u2019ve been ignoring my body\u2019s unhappiness in order to give to others. \n\nMy back has been sore from being unprotected from my weak core muscles, working nights and lifting patients. There is more to me that touches uncomfortably and gets in the way of other things. My body wants to run, wants to move. Wants to feel exerted. \nFarm work and riding and a leisurely bike ride aren\u2019t enough for me, I need that strenuous physical activity. \n\nSo last night instead of cooking a meal from scratch, I let the kids have Mr Noodles. And it\u2019s totally ok. ONCE IN AWHILE. \nEven with that, I didn\u2019t have time to change into workout clothes, put a bra on, warm up or cool down.

Those morning or evening walks which didn\u2019t need a workout playlist. The silence from having less people on the road, the birds chirping, the leaves rustling, became all the music we would ever need. \n\n4.

The way we flaunted our cooking skills when we \u2018managed\u2019 to make Dosa. Or chappathi? And we hated all those who replied with a photo and an annoying caption- \u201CChicken Pot Biryani: made by me.\u201D\n\n7.

Like I said, finally!\n\n8. The clear starry sky which freed itself from volumes of pollution and became the best piece of art to be created. \n\n9.

Try to limit screen time at night.\n\n🔹Follow 20-20-20 rule: For every 20 minutes spent using a screen, you should try to look away at something that is 20 feet away from you for a total of 20 seconds.\n\n🔹Nourish them with right nutrition: All the above tips will work only if you eat foods that help in better vision which includes: \n\n🌽🥕🥬Green leafy, yellow, red and orange color fruits and vegetables which are rich in beta carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin\n\n🍓🍊Berries and Citrus fruits which are packed with vit C\n\n🥜Nuts like almonds which will provide zinc and vit E\n\n🍣Salmon and other fatty fishes for Omega -3 fatty acids \n\nMost of the mentioned nutrients like vit A, vit C,  vit E act as antioxidants. Zinc is a \"helper molecule that plays a vital role in bringing vitamin A from the liver to the retina in order to produce melanin, a protective pigment in the eyes.  Lutein and zeaxanthin are the only carotenoids found in the eye that protect against the potential damage caused by light striking this portion of the retina.. Omega-3 fatty acids are important for proper visual development and retinal function.\n\n#health #healthconscious #healthylifestyle #healthyliving #heal #nutrition #nutritionaltherapy #lifestylemodification #technology #pandemic2020 #eyes #eyehealth #bluelight #bluecutlenses #protectyoureyes #202020rule #nourish #preventativehealth #believerofprevention #splendournutrikingdom","NumberOfLikes":19,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Splendour Nutrikingdom on August 20, 2020.

Sure I was a comedian for most of my adult life but that is just part of my human experience. At this moment in time I find very little humor in the destruction of the American Dream.  You are now experiencing the nightmare that has drugged us up in an attempt to silence reality.  So when people say Kirk why is your stuff so dark?

Show is pretty much straight very honest to the situation of pandemic. Narrative part is so gripping that for a moment everything looks highly relatable. Writing was captivating & writers have used the lockdown period & it's effects at its best. Whole premises set around COVID 19 doesn't look like a gimmick at all. It's looks very authentic till the end. Screenplay was full of heart thumping scenes. You can easily see depth in character because of the outstanding writing. \n\nShow is packed with hell lot of twists & at the end you will crave for more. This series is written, shot in lockdown, so you can clearly see there's no combined scenes of characters & thanks to razor sharp editing to make things very crispy. Show direction in online investigation scenes was clap worthy. In this show you can easily see that social media & internet can do anything. The use of social media has its own different merits & demerits. Events are neat & nothing looks unreal at all.\n\n@battatawada I'm speechless. I have reviewed your every show & film. Shweta performance in investigation scenes was gripping. @sanjaykapoor2500 intensity was sweaty in dramatic scenes. @shriya.pilgaonkar was convincing as suhani. @arjun__mathur you are everywhere on OTT, man I loved your act in last episode. Excited to see you in S2. @dibyenduofficial cameo was good. @indraneilsengupta @rukhsarrehman was also good.\n\nPlot around sahil's covid 19 was looking very rushed & few things were immersive.\n\nShow BGM gave me thrilling experience. The gone game has almost everything which shows us that a good story don't need high budget, big sets or normal surroundings. A good story can be narrate very easily with the help of excellent team & big courage. This series is simply a groundbreaking thing on OTT, sets an example for all new age filmmakers.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS:-\n\n1. TWISTS\n\n2. SCREENPLAY\n\n3. DIRECTION\n\n4. EDITING\n\n5. PERFORMANCES\n\n6.

We can choose to respond with courage and with kindness, and not let fear dictate how we live our lives. \n\nWe can learn to grow through what we go through and use everything that happens, even crisis, as the catalyst for waking up. \n\nHolding prayers for so many people evacuating from the fires in California and the countless millions of people who are trying to survive and adjust to a new reality amidst and post pandemic. \n\nLet\u2019s continue to choose love, to chose courage and kindness. \n\nLD","NumberOfLikes":65,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Plant Medicine Change Makers in Planet Earth.

Jury\u2019s still out on this school year but I\u2019m not optimistic! *Link in Bio*\n\n\u201COver the summer my son began saying, \u201CI\u2019m not good at writing.\u201D This presses a tender spot in me. The last time he told me he wasn\u2019t good at writing, I told him I was terrible at writing as a kid too. \u201CReally?\u201D he asked with a surprised look on his face. I told him I kept at it and eventually it got less hard. It would happen for him too, I told him. \u201CWow,\u201D he said almost to himself. \u201CI can\u2019t believe you were bad at writing.\u201D\n\nTruth is I was always good at writing. I\u2019ve been afraid his whole life that he\u2019ll internalize a false story that he is not good because he has a harder time learning certain things or because he operates a bit differently than other kids. The stories we tell ourselves are important, and I don\u2019t want my son stuck inside the lie that he\u2019s not good at something just because he\u2019s not being given the help he needs.\u201D\n.\n#iep #distancelearning #pandemic2020 #pandemicparenting @romper","NumberOfLikes":65,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Minna Dubin on August 20, 2020.

I couldn't just pack my bags and leave without putting thought to it. There was a lot of planning involved just to take this day trip a mere 150km away.\n\nI wanted to make sure that I absolutely don't come in contact with the locals there. Although I haven't shown symptoms of the disease, I could be a carrier and infect those who might not have the same infrastructure to deal with it like I do.\n\nSo here's a small list of ways to ensure you're travelling responsibly during the pandemic.\n\n-  Check your privilege. Remember that to be able to travel means you have a certain privilege that others lack and you must be responsible with it.\n\n- Choose offbeat locations where tourists\/ locals don't frequent often.\n\n- Roadtrips are the way to go. Public transport including trains, buses and flights should be avoided.\n\n- Pack your food. Don't rely on dhabas\/ restaurants for food. Pack easy to carry and eat food like fruits and sandwiches as well as some packaged snacks from your own home.\n\n- Carry as much water as possible to avoid buying from shops. We carried 6 litres of water in 4 bottles for this trip.\n\n- Ensure hygiene. If you absolutely do have to come in contact with locals, wear a mask, sanitize your hands before and after the meeting.\n\nTravel is inevitable and the coronavirus seems to be here to stay. It's important that all of us do our bit in doing everything we can to ensure the safety of those who's homes become tourist places for us.\n\nHappy travel, everybody ✌🏼 .\n\n#GoProLiveIt #GoProIn @goproindia","NumberOfLikes":330,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Avantika | Travel Blogger 🇮🇳 in Haryana with @cntravellerindia, @travelandleisureindia, @natgeotravellerindia, @lonelyplanetmagazineindia, @globetrottinggirlsindia, @goproindia, @indiangirlstravel, @indiangirlswander, and @girlswhotravelindia.

SPEND MORE TIME OUTSIDE AND CONNECTING WITH MOTHER NATURE. \n 🌲 🦢 🌳 🚶\u200D♀️ ⛅️ \n\n\u201CBeing in nature, or even viewing scenes of nature, reduces anger, fear, and stress and increases pleasant feelings. Exposure to nature not only makes you feel better emotionally, it contributes to your physical wellbeing, reducing blood pressure, heart rate, muscle tension, and the production of stress hormones.\u201D\n\n2. KNOW...THIS CANNOT AND WILL NOT LAST FOREVER. 🛑 ✋ \n\nNothing lasts forever. \n\nGood guys n gals always win 🦸\u200D♂️ 🦸\u200D♀️ \n\n3. BE KIND TO ONE ANOTHER! ❤️💝 ❤️ \n\nWe\u2019re all in this together & the world needs a lot more love, especially now. \n\nBe the change you wish to see in the world.\n\nAlso, \u201CWhen we help others and do kind acts, it causes our brain to release endorphins, the chemicals that give us feelings of fervor and high spirits - similar to a \"runner's high.\" Doing something nice for someone also gives the brain a serotonin boost, the chemical that gives us that feeling of satisfaction and well-being.\u201D\n\n4. TAKE A BREAK FROM SOCIAL MEDIA & THE NEWS. 💤 \n\nFrom the moment we hope onto these platforms there\u2019s constant flow of information pushed into our minds and faces.\n\nThere is a lot of great things on these platforms but also a lot of negative that will drain your day.\n\nIf you notice seeing those negative things don\u2019t  improve your day and have a negative influence and impact....Remove it, take a break to recoup, or minimize using them to a healthy level. \n\n5. KNOWING YOU, YES YOU, ARE STRONG, WORTHY, AND ABLE TO GET THROUGH THIS! 💪 \n\nWe often look towards other people to fill something we are feeling we are lacking.\nFor example, say I am so fricken sad, and I want jesse my boyfriend to cheer me up to feel better. Sometimes that works but we forget we have the power to do that for ourselves.\n\nJust like all of this going on. We all have the power to get ourselves through this. Mentally and physically. \n\nRemember your strength, power, and worth you can do gr8 things!","NumberOfLikes":13,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597897032,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 20 06:17:12 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Bath time with mama tonight!!
