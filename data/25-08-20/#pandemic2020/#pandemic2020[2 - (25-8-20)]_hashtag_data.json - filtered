The pandemic hit Peru March 17.  That 9 day trek has now turned into 164 days and counting. Quarantined in Cusco for 3.5 months of it under martial law. What a freakin  experience and wild ride this has been. Nothing could have prepared me for it! But...it hasn't come without its sacrifices, however. To get where you want to go and preserve your personal integrity and accountability along the way sometimes sacrifices need to be made. Chances need to be taken, and sometimes decisions might not be in your own best interest and that's okay, because that's part of adulting. Putting people ahead of yourself feels good. It's not always about you. Because sometimes being able to sleep at night and being happy when you wake up knowing you made the right decision outweighs everything anyone could ever want when it comes to finding internal peace and happiness. The more you put people ahead of yourself, the more you'll know and feel your self worth.

Menstruation is one of the topics but we need to consider also pregnant ladies, babies, singles ladies with kids and elder people. \n\nMenstruation is a Sacred Right needs more donations to continue to buy menstrual pads. And hopefully inspire more people to take action to help others. Due the uncertain visa situation, our aim is to continue until we can, and hopefully evolve in the future soon.\n\nIn Koh Phangan we have around 600 people who came from Myanmar looking for job and better conditions in these touristic island. Since the lockdown many burmese and locals lost their job and source of income.  Less and less people on the island, and more people are in need.\n\nOnly in Haad Rin area we have around 150 menstruating ladies, 25 babies and 6 pregnant. 11 babies under Naan Formula (very expensive product), and a new born baby with mother not healthy due lack of food.  Next month we have a new baby arriving, and if the mother needs any kind of assistance, there's no free health service available for non thai people. \n\nThis is the situation only one area of Koh Phangan. Not all the burmeses people were counted and we should also include in those numbers all the thai people which are also suffering with this pandemic situation.

Pertemuan yg bikin deg deg an sih, ada kalanya muncul was2 adakah corona di antara kita? Wajar sih ya. \n\nUntuk memastikan sama2 aman, sblm bertemu suami saya pun rapid test. Suami juga tentunya krn syarat untuk naik pesawat harus rapid test. \n\nDemi kepentingan bersama ketemu suami kali harus mau ribet mengikuti skenario protokol kesehatan. Sblm masuk mobil, saya semprot disinfectan sekujur tubuhnya, persetan sama orang2 yg pada nglihatin. Sampai rumah, sepatu, tas, baju saya semprot semua. \n\nWaktu jalan2 pun, sengaja memilih tempat2 dengan ruang terbuka yang luas. \n\nBegitu selesai liburan, sblm balik kerja lagi suami juga melakukan swab. Memastikan bahwa semuanya aman. Alhamdulillah hasilnya baik2 saja. \n\nSebagai orang yg dewasa, di masa pandemi ini, kita memang harus sadar konsekuensi ketika melakukan perjalanan luar daerah. Harus rela menjalani serangkain tes untuk memastikan aman. Apapun keribetannya tetap harus disyukuri, akhirnya bisa ketemu suami juga. \n\nSemoga pandemi ini segera berlalu, agar kita semua bisa bertemu siapa saja tanpa perasaan was2 dan curiga. \n#weekendsnote\n#pandemic2020\n#travelinpandemic\n#wanderlust\n#worlderlust \n#worlderlusters","NumberOfLikes":125,"Hashtags":["#weekendsnote","#pandemic2020","#travelinpandemic","#wanderlust","#worlderlust","#worlderlusters"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":8,"Timestamp":1597996896,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 10:01:36 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"‚ö†Ô∏èOur GoFundMe has come so far but we need to keep going!‚ö†Ô∏è\nWith your help can we support Child Literacy and Mental Health by sending \u2018Covid Monster\u2019s Visit\u2019 to those most affected by these unprecedented times, there is no such thing as donating too little, every little helps, every cent counts!üí™üèº\nIf you haven\u2019t already and you'd like to help, donate at the link in bio and don\u2019t forget to share!‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nSwipe to see where our donations are goingüëâüèºüëâüèºüëâüèº\nWe\u2019re hoping to reach and support as many children as we can with the help of @worldliteracy_foundation, @22starsfoundation  and @svpwordpower !üåç‚ú®üìö\n\n#CovidMonster #donate #donation #gofundme #gofundmedonation #crowdfunding #fundraising #covid #covid19 #pandemic #childrensbooks #childliteracy #books #mentalhealth #childrensmentalhealth #bookstagram #pandemic #pandemic2020 #childrensliterature #booksforthepandemic #worldliteracyfoundation #22starsfoundation #svp #svpwordpower #supportchildren #booklover #booksaddict #bookworm #booksofinstagram \n\n@rtenews  @rteone  @rteradio1  @bookshowrte  @instatubridy  @rternag  @rte_culture  @bbcnews  @bbcradio1  @bbcscotnews  @bbcbreakfast  @gofundme  @independent.ie  @discoverireland_  @ladbibleireland  @galwaybayfm  @bookfairiesworldwide  @abcnews  @cbsnews  @skynews  @channel4news  @cuirtfestival  @bolognachildrensbookfair  @radiomidwest  @radioleary  @eoghanmcdermott  @yvonnetiernanthecouch","NumberOfLikes":21,"Hashtags":["#CovidMonster","#donate","#donation","#gofundme","#gofundmedonation","#crowdfunding","#fundraising","#covid","#covid19","#pandemic","#childrensbooks","#childliteracy","#books","#mentalhealth","#childrensmentalhealth","#bookstagram","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#childrensliterature","#booksforthepandemic","#worldliteracyfoundation","#22starsfoundation","#svp","#svpwordpower","#supportchildren","#booklover","#booksaddict","#bookworm","#booksofinstagram"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597996857,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 10:00:57 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"In a world where we have to practice social distancing and wear a mask to protect ourselves and others we feel we might as well colour it up and wear beautiful arty masks!

The no-alarm mornings. Those days when we didn\u2019t have to hit the snooze or the off button and slept for as long as we liked.\n\n2. When shows on Netflix and Prime were mostly binged on during the day while the late night hours were exclusively allocated to video calls, chats, and Ludo King.\n\n3. Those morning or evening walks which didn\u2019t need a workout playlist. The silence from having less people on the road, the birds chirping, the leaves rustling, became all the music we would ever need. \n\n4. Movie Sessions with the whole family when Mom would see the rating of the movie on Netflix and immediately say, \u201CThat movie has s... search for another one.\u201D No amount of whining and the assurance to forward \u2018those\u2019 scenes would change her mind. \n\n5. When everyone at home took turns to beat the brains out of coffee, sugar, and water for the perfect Dalgona coffee. \n\n6. The way we flaunted our cooking skills when we \u2018managed\u2019 to make Dosa. Or chappathi? And we hated all those who replied with a photo and an annoying caption- \u201CChicken Pot Biryani: made by me.\u201D\n\n7. When most of us finally got the time to pick up that pen and write down that poem, or to pick up that guitar and sing that song, pick up that book and finish reading it, or just pick up nothing and enjoy being ourselves. Like I said, finally!\n\n8. The clear starry sky which freed itself from volumes of pollution and became the best piece of art to be created. \n\n9. The phone calls we could make after years, the conversations we could complete, the people to whom we could tell how much we love them after much procrastination.\n\n10. The friendships we found in unexpected places, in unexpected people and in unexpected ways which we strongly hope would remain with us forever.\n@sharylss \n.‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nPC: @noone.su \nSHARE YOUR FAVOURITE LOCKDOWN MEMORIES IN THE COMMENTS SECTION. \n.\n#writersofinstagram #writingcommunity #writing #writings #write #writer #writerscommunity #writersofig #writeaway #writersblock #writersnetwork #writeaway #writerssociety #writersuniverse #writersporn #lockdown2020 #lockdown #lockdownlife #covid19 #covid_19 #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife","NumberOfLikes":34,"Hashtags":["#writersofinstagram","#writingcommunity","#writing","#writings","#write","#writer","#writerscommunity","#writersofig","#writeaway","#writersblock","#writersnetwork","#writeaway","#writerssociety","#writersuniverse","#writersporn","#lockdown2020","#lockdown","#lockdownlife","#covid19","#covid_19","#pandemic2020","#pandemiclife"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Sharyl Sodadasi in Listicle.

Each of these buildings had a sick room, as pictured above. The \u201Csick room\u201D provided a place to quarantine the ill. \n\u2063\nIn 1818 a traveler, staying in the Tavern, broke out with smallpox. A meeting of community leaders ensued. \u201CThe house-fathers and masters met to consider what steps should be taken in regard to the smallpox.\u201D The solution was to move him out of town to the farm of a Moravian brother nearby. \u2063\n\u2063\nA smallpox epidemic began in Salem in 1866. The following is recorded in the Salem Diary: \u201C..as a sad consequence, the neighbors avoided as much as possible coming to town.\u201D Red flags were placed at the residences and businesses of those infected. \u2063\n\u2063\n1918 saw the influenza epidemic come to Winston-Salem. One quarter of the residents experienced the flu and some 300 died.\u2063\n\u2063\nIt is interesting that though the 18th century Moravians did not fully understand what we do about the spread of sickness they fought it the same way - quarantine.","NumberOfLikes":35,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @deanlobs1 on August 20, 2020.

I told him I kept at it and eventually it got less hard.

I\u2019ve been afraid his whole life that he\u2019ll internalize a false story that he is not good because he has a harder time learning certain things or because he operates a bit differently than other kids. The stories we tell ourselves are important, and I don\u2019t want my son stuck inside the lie that he\u2019s not good at something just because he\u2019s not being given the help he needs.\u201D\n.\n#iep #distancelearning #pandemic2020 #pandemicparenting @romper","NumberOfLikes":65,"Hashtags":["#iep","#distancelearning","#pandemic2020","#pandemicparenting"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Minna Dubin on August 20, 2020.

I couldn't just pack my bags and leave without putting thought to it. There was a lot of planning involved just to take this day trip a mere 150km away.\n\nI wanted to make sure that I absolutely don't come in contact with the locals there. Although I haven't shown symptoms of the disease, I could be a carrier and infect those who might not have the same infrastructure to deal with it like I do.\n\nSo here's a small list of ways to ensure you're travelling responsibly during the pandemic.\n\n-  Check your privilege. Remember that to be able to travel means you have a certain privilege that others lack and you must be responsible with it.\n\n- Choose offbeat locations where tourists\/ locals don't frequent often.\n\n- Roadtrips are the way to go. Public transport including trains, buses and flights should be avoided.\n\n- Pack your food. Don't rely on dhabas\/ restaurants for food. Pack easy to carry and eat food like fruits and sandwiches as well as some packaged snacks from your own home.\n\n- Carry as much water as possible to avoid buying from shops. We carried 6 litres of water in 4 bottles for this trip.\n\n- Ensure hygiene. If you absolutely do have to come in contact with locals, wear a mask, sanitize your hands before and after the meeting.\n\nTravel is inevitable and the coronavirus seems to be here to stay. It's important that all of us do our bit in doing everything we can to ensure the safety of those who's homes become tourist places for us.\n\nHappy travel, everybody ‚úåüèº .\n\n#GoProLiveIt #GoProIn @goproindia","NumberOfLikes":330,"Hashtags":["#GoProLiveIt","#GoProIn"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Avantika | Travel Blogger üáÆüá≥ in Haryana with @cntravellerindia, @travelandleisureindia, @natgeotravellerindia, @lonelyplanetmagazineindia, @globetrottinggirlsindia, @goproindia, @indiangirlstravel, @indiangirlswander, and @girlswhotravelindia.

KNOW...THIS CANNOT AND WILL NOT LAST FOREVER. üõë ‚úã \n\nNothing lasts forever. \n\nGood guys n gals always win ü¶∏\u200D‚ôÇÔ∏è ü¶∏\u200D‚ôÄÔ∏è \n\n3. BE KIND TO ONE ANOTHER! ‚ù§Ô∏èüíù ‚ù§Ô∏è \n\nWe\u2019re all in this together & the world needs a lot more love, especially now. \n\nBe the change you wish to see in the world.\n\nAlso, \u201CWhen we help others and do kind acts, it causes our brain to release endorphins, the chemicals that give us feelings of fervor and high spirits - similar to a \"runner's high.\" Doing something nice for someone also gives the brain a serotonin boost, the chemical that gives us that feeling of satisfaction and well-being.\u201D\n\n4. TAKE A BREAK FROM SOCIAL MEDIA & THE NEWS. üí§ \n\nFrom the moment we hope onto these platforms there\u2019s constant flow of information pushed into our minds and faces.\n\nThere is a lot of great things on these platforms but also a lot of negative that will drain your day.\n\nIf you notice seeing those negative things don\u2019t  improve your day and have a negative influence and impact....Remove it, take a break to recoup, or minimize using them to a healthy level. \n\n5. KNOWING YOU, YES YOU, ARE STRONG, WORTHY, AND ABLE TO GET THROUGH THIS! üí™ \n\nWe often look towards other people to fill something we are feeling we are lacking.\nFor example, say I am so fricken sad, and I want jesse my boyfriend to cheer me up to feel better. Sometimes that works but we forget we have the power to do that for ourselves.\n\nJust like all of this going on. We all have the power to get ourselves through this. Mentally and physically. \n\nRemember your strength, power, and worth you can do gr8 things!","NumberOfLikes":13,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597897032,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 20 06:17:12 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Bath time with mama tonight!!
