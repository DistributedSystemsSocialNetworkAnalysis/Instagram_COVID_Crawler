Malzemelerimi önceden dograyip deepfreezede kutularda sakladigimdan yemek isini çabuk hallettim. Bol sogani ve 2-3 diş sarimsaği soteleyerek başladim.. arpa şehriye ilave edip biraz kavurdum.. tukaş paprikayi ilave ettim... sonra kirmizi ve yeşil biberleri kattim... biraz çevirdim. Sonra da onceden ufak dogradiğim domatesleri ilave ettim. Maydonoz da doğradım. Domates suyunu çekmeye başlayınca spatulayla malzemeyi wok tavanin tabanina yaydim. Uzerine 1.5 cay fincanı kırmızı mercimeği koyup onun da üzerini bastırdım. Ve yanlardan usulca sıcak su ilave ettim. Su mercimeklerin biraz üstüne çıkınca, biraz aralik birakarak kapak kapattım. Hic karistirmadim. Suyunu çektikçe yanlardan azar azar su ilave ettim. Pişmesine yakın üzerine biraz daha maydonoz ilave ettim. Veee soğumaya bıraktım. Pancarlı, kirmizi lahanali, soganli, yoğurtlu patlıcan salatasi da yaptim. Afiyetle yedim. Hem hafif yemek, hem lezzetli, hem de doyurucu👍 yaninda bol limon dilimli su😊 haaa bi de puding yaptım. Içine  ceviz taneleri, minik doğradiğim 3-4 kuru kayisi ve 3 tane de pötibör bisküviyi kırıp hepsini piserken karistirdim. Çikolatalı çakiltaşlariyla da süsledim.

I\u2019ve been put through the motha fuckin RINGER and if I didn\u2019t have this mentality I totally would have crumbled by now. I\u2019ve been thinking about this quote a lot the last few days. If you watch my stories than you know that I am in a terrible situation when it comes to housing right now. Due to the pandemic we have to move like immediately, we didn\u2019t get approved for the loan to buy the house since the landlord wants to sell, and the rental market is terrible. I had a mini breakdown yesterday. I started thinking about how I ALWAYS do everything by the book and things just don\u2019t work out for me. When you are trying to break cycles of poverty, addiction, homelessness, it\u2019s not as easy as \u201Cwork hard and you will succeed\u201D. I\u2019ve spent my entire life working as hard as I can, getting all straight a\u2019s, working multiple jobs, and still I always fall short because of something from my past. Both of my parents have passed away, so I don\u2019t have anyone to help me co-sign for loans, or lend me a few dollars if I need it, or teach me how to build credit or apply for a mortgage. My mom let her addiction get the best of her and she started me off with terrible credit when I turned 18 by using my SSN to sign up for cards, gas and electric.. the list goes on. I\u2019ve been trying to work off the disadvantages growing up in extreme poverty with addict parents my entire life.. and it\u2019s fucking hard. My life has been full of struggles, unbelievable stories, things you only see in the movies.. and I could have let it ruin me. But I just let it fuel my fire. Some days I just want to throw in the towel, but then I think about what I\u2019ve already been able to survive. You can get through ANYTHING with hope. It\u2019s not as easy as \u201Cworking hard\u201D, and it won\u2019t always be a straight path, but if you never give up on yourself, I promise you it will just make you more and more unbreakable every single time.

So lets have a look at why we are having such a reaction & what we can do to limit some of the damage!\n ✨\nThe biggest issue with face masks is the condensation from our breath. This condensation creates a warm & moist environment; leading to blocked pores, bacteria growth and irritation. Inflammatory conditions such as Dermatitis, Psoriasis, Acne & Rosacea are irritated & flare ups are common. The tightness of the face coverings also create friction, rashes & in some instances, hives. One of the biggest issues of this new micro-climate is that it causes the skin to sweat more, whilst the masks simultaneously absorb the skins natural oils. Thus leaving our skin dry, producing excess sebum & sore\/flaky.\n ✨\nIf you are not a frontline (Healthcare) worker, then always use face coverings made from a breathable fabric (stay far away from synthetics), wash it regularly & try to limit any make up worn. TLC is paramount, so make sure you are supplying adequate hydration & then locking this in with an emollient \u2013 reapplication may be required multiple times throughout the day. The right facial oil may also be beneficial at this time to sooth certain conditions, keep the skin flexible & limit irritation. Also try to limit known skin irritants if you will be wearing a mask directly afterwards eg, acids, retinol, fragrance, tea tree\/witch hazel.\n✨\n#pandemic2020 #pandemic #facemasks #facemaskselfie #skinproblems #skinproblemsolution #healthcareworkers #healthcareheroes #ppe #skin #skincare #skincaretips #skinspecialist #acne #acnetreatment #dermatitis #eczema #sensitiveskin #cheltenham #cheltenhamlife #cheltenhamwomeninbusiness #cotswolds #cotswold #cotswoldlife #gloucestershire","NumberOfLikes":28,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Advanced Skin Cheltenham in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.

Drone inspections are more thorough- with a drone we can observe all those difficult-to-access places. The roof of the home can have a plethora of nooks and crannies, and without a drone it\u2019s hard to see some of the finer details. \n\n2. Drone inspections are more efficient- the drones ability to fly allows it to cover a broader area more quickly than a person with a ladder navigating steep slopes. \n\n3. Drones can provide an aerial overview of the property- this can come in handy for properties that come with a vast amount of acres and out buildings. This way you can see the condition of the buildings from above, the landscape features, placement of trees and shrubs and neighbors. \n\nNeed an inspection on a roof our ladders can\u2019t reach?

Most people infected will experience a mild to moderate respiratory illness, whilst others will show no symptoms at all. However for some the effects are severe and longer lasting.\n\nOur aim in this yoga programme is to play some role in aiding the process of recovery. By only requiring the use of mostly basic props and furniture, we have tried to make the poses as accessible as possible for everyone.\n\nThe programme was compiled thanks to advice and guidance from Abhijata Iyengar, Lois Steinberg, Gulnaaz Dashti, Stephanie Quirk, the IY(UK) Therapy Committee, IY(UK) teachers who have experienced the virus themselves, and decades of work by BKS Iyengar and Dr Geeta S.

For a lot of us that means having a STABLE job. \n\nJOB security- implies that your job is safe for the foreseeable future and hopefully till retirement. It can provide a lot of benefits. It provides you with a steady income as long as your job is secure. Most people seek security because it is a simple way to earn a living, your employer has your job and income covered. The sad truth about this NO job is really safe anymore. \n\nINCOME security- can mean your income never comes from one single source, if one source fails you have other sources to tap into, and eventually replace the failed sources with new ones. You create  and are maintaining a portfolio of income streams. \n\nWith the economy and employment conditions we are facing today i think its important to create income security. \n\nThere are various ways to create income security, one of them is self employment, I myself chose to start a business so i could create that income security. With the pandemic going on and many people being laid off, myself included, i reevaluated my relationship with my job and decided it was time to make a change and fight for that income security and be apart of something that is recession proof. My favourite thing is being in control of my income, and the fact that its more secure then any other jobs i have had, i rather have all the power and my personal freedom instead. #income #streamsofincome #helpingothers #freedom #job #security #career #opportunity #security #stability #pandemic2020 #incomestreams #incomeopportunities #calgary #jobloss #searchforbetter","NumberOfLikes":18,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Chealsey Lewis in Calgary, Alberta.

So proud to be part of this important project. \n\nReposting @iyengaryoga_uk:⠀\n\n\"The IY(UK) Therapy Committee has created a video and compiled a booklet with a suggested yoga programme to support recovery from Covid-19. ⠀\n⠀\nAs we know, Covid-19 is a highly infectious disease caused by the coronavirus. Most people infected will experience a mild to moderate respiratory illness, whilst others will show no symptoms at all. However for some the effects are severe and longer lasting.⠀\n⠀\nOur aim in this yoga programme is to play some role in aiding the process of recovery. By only requiring the use of mostly basic props and furniture, we have tried to make the poses as accessible as possible for everyone.⠀\n⠀\nThe programme was compiled thanks to advice and guidance from Abhijata Iyengar, Lois Steinberg, Gulnaaz Dashti, Stephanie Quirk, the IY(UK) Therapy Committee, IY(UK) teachers who have experienced the virus themselves, and decades of work by BKS Iyengar and Dr Geeta S. Iyengar in medical classes at RIMYI in Pune.⠀\n⠀\nSee the link in our bio to access the video and booklet, which are both freely available. Please consider donating a contribution towards this and future Iyengar yoga therapy resources 🙏⠀\n⠀\nThanks to all involved in creating the programme and to @adrienne_karmaspaceyoga for designing the e-book⠀\n⠀\n#iyengaryoga #yogatherapy #covid19 #covid_19 #coronavirus #recovery #covidhelp #yogaforhealing #yoga #pandemic #pandemic2020 #virus #postcovid #yogapractice #loveyoga #yogateachers  #iyengarmethod #yogadaily #practiceyoga #yogisofinstagram #yogajourney\" #iyengarmethod #iyengarprops #iyengaryogateacher #iyengaryogamethod #bksiyengar #bksiyengaryoga #yogatherapist #yogatherapist #therapeutic #recovery #hatha #yogateacher","NumberOfLikes":35,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by KarmaspaceYoga Adrienne on August 18, 2020.

I took both of my parents at Dhaka Medical Hospital and admitted them in the Covid isolation unit. \nFrom the beginning of quarantine I was having difficulty with my father, couldn\u2019t make him properly follow the rules. He used to go outside almost everyday, would mingle with mass people, wouldn\u2019t sanitise himself properly after coming back from outside and so on. \nSo during the time of Eid-ul-fitr Abba went to Sonargaon (our village home) stayed there for a couple of days and roamed around the whole village, without any mask or any form of protection. He came back home after 4 days, and the worst happened, which was inevitable. Both of my parents my sister got sick within the span of three days. My father refused to take the RT-PCR test. We often live in a state of denial, which eventually makes us pay a high amount. In this case my father's denials like not wanting to take Covid test, not wanting to get admitted in the hospital when situation seemed to be under control made us pay a lot. \nSo eventually their situation deteriorated and on day 14th of their being sick both of them started having severe breathing difficulty. I only had one oxygen cylinder rented at home. I started giving them oxygen turn by turn but that was not enough at all. As situation already was out of control and I saw that both of my parents might die at any moment, I forced them to get admitted at hospital. \nI never thought I would have to take such responsibility at such a short notice. I lived through my worst nightmare. I wanted to write about this experience but couldn\u2019t make myself doing so. Cause writing about this would make me relive those days again. And even after 2 months of these events I still have nightmares I still find it difficult to fall asleep. \nTo be continued (maybe)\n.\n.\n#inthetimeofcorona #coviddays #covidstories #corona #pandemic #covid19  #coronavirus #pandemiclife #stayathome #staysafe #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife #life #hope","NumberOfLikes":66,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Sumyea Sinha on August 18, 2020.

Let me explain the picture on this post. For the moment I live in South Korea (no Im not Korean) , this picture was taken at my local gym on August 19th. On the left side of the pic we have a column that depicts a person that is infected with Covid-19. On the right side we have a peson that is not infected with Covid-19. Now according to this propaganda piece of laminated paper, if you and the infected person are wearing a mask the possibility of infection is 1.5%. If the infected and the none infected are not wearing a mask then the possibility of infection is 100%. Now I dont know if any of you remember this but around 5 months ago the WHO was against wearing a mask and even said that wearing a mask doesn't protect you from the virus. They were right but as soon as Trump dropped financial aid support for the WHO , they sided with communist China and changed their mindset regarding the mask. The mask doesn't protect you from shit, that is the point of this posting. It only slowly poisons your lungs by breathing your own C02. The mask is only a symbol of communist compliance to the government, that is the only purpose for it. \n\nNow for my fellow Koreans, please wake up! Stop believing the mainstream news, stop watching your apps about infected people, those numbers are fake most of the time. Even if you die from a heart attack some hospitals are labeling the cause of death as Covid-19 in order to get funding. Stop trusting your government, they are best friends with communist China and have no interest in fixing this situation at all other than continuing on inposing this stupid rules. Yeah Korea is safe from the chaos in the West, but nothing last forever and soon Korea will fall into civil unrest...people can only take so much before they explode and decide that enough is fucking enough!! The mask is a symbol of communism plain and simple. That is all.\n\n#control #covid19sucks #billgatescoronavirus #billgates #drfauci #drfauciisafraud #pandemic2020 #covid_19 #fake #bullshit #hiddenagenda #science #commonsense #stop #mask #fuckmask #lies #2020corruption #hydroxychloroquine #doctorsfortruth #cure #vaccine #endtimes #Zionist","NumberOfLikes":12,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The Collector ☠ in Seoul, Korea.

The production team copied the interior of the house, including the spiral staircase, almost exactly on a soundstage at Paramount.\n\nPlease note that this is a private residence so if you visit please do not trespass or disturb the people that live there.\n\nConsidered to be one of the greatest movies of all time, the film stars Fred MacMurray as an insurance salesman, Barbara Stanwyck as a provocative housewife who wishes her husband were dead, and Edward G. Robinson as a claims adjuster whose job is to find phony claims. The term \"double indemnity\" refers to a clause in certain life insurance policies that doubles the payout in rare cases when the death is accidental, such as falling off a train.\n\nPraised by many critics when first released, \u201CDouble Indemnity\u201D was nominated for seven Academy Awards but did not win any. Widely regarded as a classic, it often is cited as having set the standard for film noir.\n\nFun facts - The blonde wig that Barbara Stanwyck is wearing throughout the movie was the idea of Billy Wilder. A month into shooting Wilder suddenly realized how bad it looked, but by then it was too late to re-shoot the earlier scenes. To rationalize this mistake, in later interviews Wilder claimed that the bad-looking wig was intentional.\n\nBilly Wilder and Raymond Chandler did not get along whilst writing the script, a process that was apparently filled with  on-stop arguments. #filminglocation #doubleindemnity #beachwoodcanyon #hollywoodtour #pandemic2020 #socialdistancing #wearamask #tonymiros","NumberOfLikes":73,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":40,"Timestamp":1597772813,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 18 19:46:53 CEST 2020","Location":"Beachwood Canyon, Los Angeles"},{"CaptionText":"One leg at a time . . . \n.\n.\n.\nIt\u2019s easy to get off track at these times.

There are plenty of hurdles before any new invention can hit the market, but the team seems quite gung-ho about their prospects.\n\n#masks #facemasks #covid #covid19awareness #nanomaterial #sarscov2 #sars #covid19 #N95masks #microorganisms #virus #pandemic2020 #epidemic #pharmacist #pharmafacts #factspharma #factsonly #didyouknowfact #pharmfacts","NumberOfLikes":13,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by PharmaClass on August 18, 2020.

This isn't necessarily a bad thing because you know the response for actually danger..

I know my panic attacks can either come on  sudden or I could feel them brewing days before.. than BAM! it would hit me. \n.\nThe thing is, in the moment you feel like shit but, just as it comes, it will also go.

The trail meanders through woods and around two small lakes which were teeming with turtles and birds. Great egrets were in abundance. The most interesting aspect of the park is the Doll's Head Trail which is an outdoor gallery of sorts. The art is created from the trash that has been found in the park after the South River floods. Doll's heads are incorporated into many of the installations which resemble the work of Howard Finster. I found the doll's heads creepy, especially during this pandemic which is why I avoided sharing those with you.

Health experts say two days or less is optimal for returning test results to make them useful for stopping transmission. If test results take more than three days, people are unlikely to self-quarantine and getting in touch with the people they interact with during that time, potentially spreading the virus, can be difficult. \u2060\n\u2060\nThe survey results varied state by state. Some, like Massachusetts and South Dakota, had average turnaround times of just over two days. Others, like Arizona and West Virginia, were closer to four and a half days, on average.

Ilhan Omar while visiting Minnesota, her home state. During his campaign speech, he accused her of fraud and claimed she cheated into winning the Democratic primary.\n__________________________________________________ \nEarlier today, Trump exclaimed in front of his supporters in Mankato that Omar possibly cheated after she won the Democratic primaries last week. He said, \u201CI mean I hear the boos. How the hell did she win the primary?,\u201D he asked the crowd. \u201CHow the hell did she win? This woman is crazy. She\u2019s a horrible woman who hates our country.\u201D\n__________________________________________________ \nAfterward, Trump joked about checking the mail-in votes but continued to rant about Omar \u201Chating the country.\u201D \u201CNo seriously. How does a woman who hates our country, who says nothing but bad things about our country and Israel and other of our allies? How does this woman win?

Taking a mental health day to take care of yourself is definitely needed. Thanks to the universe and all the positive forces I was able to get 3 days off.

I was lucky to attend the Jazz Women Summit by @jazzgirlstx where I left inspired, determined and glad to have met a wonder group of women. Through that summit I was introduced to @keyofshejazz, where I indulged in a week full of learning, had a master class with the lovely @roxycoss and met another batch of amazing girls that do and like what I do. Last but certainly not least I was honored to take classes with the @jazzdotorg orchestra members in the Summer Jazz Academy online, something I probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to do in person. Probably if all these programs hadn\u2019t gone online, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to participate. I am eternally grateful. I didn\u2019t get a tan this summer, I got so much more.

How are you and your children feeling about going back?\u2060\n.\u2060\nWhen I sent Little Man back to nursery in July I was so worried. Was it safe? Would the changes they'd made freak him out? Would he be happy? How would he adapt after so long at home? Would he get upset going back? Was I being selfish sending him back so I could work? Should I just keep him at home with me? So many questions running through my mind, and so much time spent weighing up the pros and cons. So I understand how it must feel (for both you and your children) now you're preparing to send your children back to school after 5 months at home under such weird circumstances. \u2060\n.\u2060\nThat's why I'm offering 10% off my entire hug range from now until the end of the month, including these squishy hug buttons. Hug Buttons were invented by a mum as a way of comforting her child who was anxious about starting school. She drew a heart on her hand, and a heart on the hand of her son and if he felt lonely or sad whilst at school he could 'press' the button which would then send a hug! These squishy hugs offer a physical form of comfort for children who may be missing a loved one whilst at school, nursery or while their loved one is at work. To take advantage of the offer simply head to my Etsy shop (the link is in my bio). You don't need any codes, the discount is applied automatically. \u2060\n. \u2060\nOh and Little Man absolutely loved being back at nursery. He's completely flourished since he's been back and comes home every day he's there full of everything he's done and who he's played with. I think the transition back was harder for me than him! \u2060\n.\u2060\n#backtoschool #backtoschool2020 #schoolsreopening #endoflockdown #lockdown2020 #socialdistancing #transitionphase #backtonormality #thenewnormal #pandemic2020 #hugbuttons #handmadehugs #backtoschooloffer #handmadecomforts #snugglehugs #hugbuddy #cuddlytoy #pockethug #parentingthroughapandemic #thisisparenthood #shopsmall #shoplocal #summerholidays #schoolprep #etsyuk #etsyseller #etsyshop #discount #salenowon #shopnow\u2060","NumberOfLikes":18,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Handmade Unique Toys in Newcastle upon Tyne.

Thankfully the building, and the \"Alto Nido\" sign out front that is glimpsed briefly in the film, are still there! Yay! \n\nLocated at \u202A1851 North Ivar Street\u202C in Hollywood, the Spanish-Colonial style building, with its red tile roof and wrought-iron balconies, was built in 1930 and was first used as a hotel. Around the late 1940s it was converted into an apartment home and became a residence for aspiring actors, screenwriters, and dreamers hoping to make a name for themselves in tinsel-town. \n\nPlease note that this is a private residence so if you visit please do not trespass or disturb the people that live there.\n\nDirected and co-written by Billy Wilder, \u201CSunset Blvd\u201D also stars Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond, a former silent-film star who draws Joe into her demented fantasy world, where she dreams of making a triumphant return to the screen. Erich von Stroheim plays Max von Mayerling, her devoted butler, and Nancy Olson as the fresh faced ingenue who falls for Joe. \n\nFun facts - According to The Movieland Directory, a few of the recognizable names that took up residence in Alto Nido during the golden age of Hollywood were Roscoe \u201CFatty\u201D Arbuckle, Claudette Colbert, Pat O\u2019Brien, George Cukor, and Al \u201CGrandpa Munster\u201D Lewis. \n\nThis historic apartment building is also supposedly one of the places Elizabeth Short, \u201CThe Black Dahlia\", lived before her brutal murder. Hence, it was used in the 2006 movie, \u201CThe Black Dahlia\u201D\n\n\u201CSunset Boulevard\u201D was nominated for 11 Academy Awards(including nominations in all four acting categories) and won three. It is often ranked among the greatest movies ever made. #filminglocation #altonidoapartments #joegillis #sunsetboulevardmovie #hollywoodtour #pandemic2020 #socialdistancing #wearamask #tonymiros","NumberOfLikes":44,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1597687523,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 20:05:23 CEST 2020","Location":"Alto Nido"},{"CaptionText":"Man it\u2019s been a 💩 storm around here the last month or so.

It\u2019s celebrating alone when your child hits their first home run or rides their bike for the first time.\n\nWhile these things are small in the grand scheme of life, it doesn\u2019t make them any less heartbreaking at the time. After all life is made up of small things. There are moments that are a slap in the face reminder of the circumstances your in, but there is also unbelievable joy to be found.\n\nI am very fortunate to have an amazing support system that help me when possible. They provide encouragement, babysit and ensure that he has a wonderful Christian education at a private school. All those mean so much but the encouragement means the most. It keeps me going on dark days when I feel like I am failing at it all.\n\nSo, take a moment now and then to say an encouraging word to those in your life, and most importantly yourself.\n\n**i did not create the pic, unknown who created.\n**follow @single_momma_chaos","NumberOfLikes":4,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @single_momma_chaos on August 17, 2020.

No asthma. No nothing. His pediatrician said put him in! @cchidest \n-He\u2019s young for his age in his grade. He just turned 8 a few months ago. Usually due to this, developmentally, he does well in a structured setting esp. the start of the school year. \n-He is very obedient under the supervision of anyone but his parents. ;) I know he will make sure to follow and practice all of the rules of social distancing!!\n-He has a history of separation anxiety & social anxiety. He does much better being around kids to overcome these genetic nuisances he inherited from both sides of his family. This was the biggest reason we felt that this kiddo had to go back to school. After two months of being homeschooled & away from his peers this spring, he hid behind me when he saw his cousin & was anxious. That was the red flag that caused me to think, this is NOT a good situation!!\n\nPrayers to all on the decisions you have made for your children. God only knows we are trying to do what\u2019s best! Unfortunately, no decision is a perfect one in the setting of a pandemic. \n\nSchool may end up being completely virtual anyway at the end of the day, but at least we can say we tried! \n\n#mentalhealthmatters #benefitsvsrisks #prayingforthebest❤️ #dolphin4life #dogwood #dogwoodelementaryschool #thirdgradeherewecome #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":45,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":14,"Timestamp":1597686125,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 19:42:05 CEST 2020","Location":"Germantown, Tennessee"},{"CaptionText":"Restaurant: Sushi Samba 🍣 \nTaking advantage of the eat out to help out scheme and getting some sushi in 😋 Great excuse to use my own chopsticks that I got for my birthday 🎁 \nLoved their lobster taquito and Neo Tokyo samba rolls 🤤 What\u2019s your favourite dish there? 😁\n\n| #sushisamba  #sushi  #japanesefood  #eatouttohelpout  #instafood  #Japanese  #summer2020  #foodporn  #food  #foodphotography  #lobster  #taquito  #seafood  #chopsticks  #foodie  #foods  #mussels  #foodstagram  #foodlover  #foodblogger  #foodies  #pandemic2020  #foodheaven  #foodbeast  #foodstyling  #foodblogfeed |#foodoftheday  #cookingdiaries  #docscooking","NumberOfLikes":72,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597685781,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 19:36:21 CEST 2020","Location":"SUSHISAMBA"},{"CaptionText":"#stayhome #staysafe #stayhealthy #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":6,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Chè on August 17, 2020.
