There was little reason to go, most places were closed, my school, ICP, moved from 43rd Street and 6th Avenue, to the Lower East Side and has been closed ever since, and I\u2019ve been reluctant to travel by subway. But my Leica M-4 needed repair, and the shop that I\u2019ve used for years, Nippon Camera Repair (the best in the city), is located just west of 5th Avenue on West 39th Street. So, I took two slow moving buses from the Upper West Side to the shop. Midtown is strange and eerie, if not a bit scary, even midday. Many many stores are still closed, some are boarded up. There are more mannequins in store windows then people on the streets. Emptiness prevails. Bryant Park is relatively peopleless. The few beings around are mostly wearing masks, some are in dark face shields. Traffic is very light, you can jaywalk at will. All this still, five months after the virus struck New York City devastatingly hard. New York is handling the pandemic, as we handle most things. With time, we will survive, but life should be about more than surviving. #icpconcerned #covidstoriesnyc #coronadays #coronadiaries #socialdistancing #coronavirus #wsp_covid19 #socialdistancing #covid_19photography #thenewnormal #alonetogether #coronavirusnyc #faceshield #pandemic2020 #massisolationaus #massisolationformat #fifthavenuenyc #sixfeetapart #burnmagazine #capturedmoments #eyeshotmag #etczine #nytimes #huffingtonpost #streetwalking #streetphotography #streetphotomag #streets-storytelling #storyofthestreets #instagramhub ¬©Harvey Stein 2020","NumberOfLikes":131,"Hashtags":["#icpconcerned","#covidstoriesnyc","#coronadays","#coronadiaries","#socialdistancing","#coronavirus","#wsp_covid19","#socialdistancing","#covid_19photography","#thenewnormal","#alonetogether","#coronavirusnyc","#faceshield","#pandemic2020","#massisolationaus","#massisolationformat","#fifthavenuenyc","#sixfeetapart","#burnmagazine","#capturedmoments","#eyeshotmag","#etczine","#nytimes","#huffingtonpost","#streetwalking","#streetphotography","#streetphotomag","#streets-storytelling","#storyofthestreets","#instagramhub"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Harvey Stein in Fifth Avenue NYC.

Generational conditioning (probably not the correct term, but my brain fogged brain is saying we're using it) is a large part of how old ways of thinking are able to survive the years. Which can be okay when you're talking about things that help us keep a civilized society, but can be really bad when bias and hate are also thrown in there under the guise of \"it's how things are,\" or other \"lessons\" that teach good things but then have that undercurrent of bad. I mean, at one point, and maybe it's even still being taught somewhere, white people taught their children that enslaving black people was okay. We know it's not, now- but it does show how something so wrong can be accepted because \"It's how things are,\" or \"it's tradition.\" The same can happen with politics. Some families are very political and teach their children that the only correct side is whichever party they are in. Then they grow up not really knowing anything else, and their perspective is so limited, they are incapable of seeing when things aren't right in their own party. They are conditioned to believe the government works perfectly and grow up to not question it, as long as the right party is in power. We have to break this conditioning if we don't want this country to crumble. This same thing can happen with relationships and all kinds of other things. People often repeat the behaviors of their parents unless they can break the cycle. Search for these things within yourself and work on them.

We have managed to squeeze a classroom into our home with the help of all of you.  As you know we spent a hot summer day suffocating in our masks only to find a bare warehouse at IKEA.  Not one desk left.  So I left with 12 plastic beach shovels with no beach in site.  We did finally  manage to find a talented artist on Facebook that handcrafted 4 beautiful matching  desks that I pray none of you carve before the weeks end. \nWe are going to do things a-little different this year. I\u2019m really pushing leadership skills & a strong science curriculum ( that\u2019s why you have a duo scope ) \nTherefore when one of you learns a concept your ability to teach it to your sibling classmates will be your test to move forward.  Making sure that your 4th 5th & 8th grade fellow students understand it clears the path for you to move onto your next assignment.  You may find yourself moving up or down in levels but that\u2019s ok.  Your grades are counting on this. \nMy main focus as the administrator  will be  Pre School thru first grade.  I\u2019ve managed to find a program that guarantees reading in 30 days or a money back guarantee.  Same with writing.  I purchased 5 different programs through Instagram so we are bound to have a 1st grade reader and writer  by October 1st.  If not we use that refund to buy Xbox live cards for the top student leaders and add a 1st grader to the concept learning.  It\u2019s going to take patience & a smidgeon more time but think of all the gaming you\u2019ll be able to do on a school night when she rattles her first sight words ...bacteria... germs...viral load.... contamination. \nI promise you there is no school or district that can maintain the level of safety care & education that Rona has  forced me to  provide but because we are considered a micro school by size continuing  social distancing will be required  throughout the school year so please keep that in mind.  Studies show 6 feet is not enough so double that please. Im available through email  a text but if it\u2019s an  immediate concern message me through Facebook. \n\nLet\u2019s make this our best year yet üôåüò∑ü¶†\nMom #parenting10 #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":41,"Hashtags":["#parenting10","#pandemic2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Aimee Hairr on August 16, 2020.

While short termism punishes the environment around us for monetary gain, we lose out in the end.\n\nIt seems like covid fell out of the blue, but a pandemic like this (or worse) has been on the cards for a while. Governments have been warned by scientists and international bodies that industrial farming and our rates of deforestation put us at a high risk of disease.\n\nThe good news is that those same scientists and international bodies have made a plan to avoid future pandemics. It takes the form of #onehealth. This has been around for a while, thanks to the @who and the @fao, and is an infinitely sensible guide for governments to follow. It is based on common sense: a healthy planet means healthy people. This is quite a revolution to our society, I'm sure you'd agree. But we know it to be true.\n\nEach of these suggestions can be acted upon on an individual level as well as a policy level. We can support local farmers and boycott supermarket meat and dairy. We can fight to save the forests near our homes. We can foster a relationship with and love of the natural world in ourselves and our children.\n\nWe don't know how bad this or the next pandemic will be, but we know what needs to happen to stop them. And luckily this plan makes life better for us in the process.\n\n#permacultureillustrator #coronakindness #pandemic2020 #nomorecovid19","NumberOfLikes":1083,"Hashtags":["#onehealth.","#permacultureillustrator","#coronakindness","#pandemic2020","#nomorecovid19"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Brenna Quinlan on August 16, 2020.","NumberOfComments":28,"Timestamp":1597617646,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 00:40:46 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"I\u2019m guarding my mom\u2019s üò∑ \u2063\n.\u2063\n.\u2063\n.\u2063\n.\u2063\n.\u2063\n#popular #cute #happy #adorable #dog #doggy #dogsofinsta #dogsofinstagram #instadog #dogstagram #puppy #pupstagram #instapup #chihuahua #chihuahuasofinstagram #chihuahualove #chihuahualife #chihuahuafanatics #masks #staysafe #covid19 #pandemic2020 #lifewillneverbethesame","NumberOfLikes":29,"Hashtags":["#popular","#cute","#happy","#adorable","#dog","#doggy","#dogsofinsta","#dogsofinstagram","#instadog","#dogstagram","#puppy","#pupstagram","#instapup","#chihuahua","#chihuahuasofinstagram","#chihuahualove","#chihuahualife","#chihuahuafanatics","#masks","#staysafe","#covid19","#pandemic2020","#lifewillneverbethesame"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Zak in Montreal, Quebec.

Built in 1953, the green, retro, Art Deco building looks much the same as it did onscreen. It\u2019s located at \u202A1830 Winona Boulevard\u202C in the Los Feliz area of Los Angeles. Please note that this is a private residence so if you visit please do not trespass or disturb the people that live there.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t seen this popular series yet, it basically gives viewers an insight into the mind of Joe, who is stalking the women he loves. Based on a series of novels, the second season is loosely based on the novel \u201CHidden Bodies\u201D by Caroline Kepnes - which picks up with Joe where the first season left off. That\u2019s all I\u2019ll say. I don\u2019t want to give any spoilers for those if you who haven\u2019t seen the series yet. \n\nGood news for fans of the show...an official return date hasn't been announced just yet, but Netflix has renewed the series for a third season!\n\nFun facts - It's hard to imagine anyone else playing Joe, but Penn Badgley was unsure about taking the role at first. ¬†In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said he was \"conflicted\" about the part, largely because the show is framed as a love story. \"If this is a love story, what is it saying?\" he said. Ultimately, discussions with showrunners convinced him to take the part. \n\nDue to the fact that most of Joe\u2019s lines are actually voiceover, Penn said that most days he wouldn't have much dialogue to actually memorize. In fact, Penn\u2019s first acting jobs were doing voiceovers for a radio station and Nintendo 64 video games when he was only 10 years old.  #filminglocation #losfeliz #younetflix #pennbadgley #hollywoodtour #pandemic2020 #socialdistancing #wearamask #tonymiros @younetflix","NumberOfLikes":46,"Hashtags":["#filminglocation","#losfeliz","#younetflix","#pennbadgley","#hollywoodtour","#pandemic2020","#socialdistancing","#wearamask","#tonymiros"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1597598564,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 16 19:22:44 CEST 2020","Location":"Los Feliz\/ Hollywood Hills"},{"CaptionText":"Umm can we talk about that freak thunderstorm we just had!!?!

If the virus had been genetically engineered in a lab there would be signs of manipulation in the genome data.\n\nThis would include evidence of an existing viral sequence as the backbone for the new virus, and obvious, targeted inserted (or deleted) genetic elements.\nBut no such evidence exists. It is very unlikely that any techniques used to genetically engineer the virus would not leave a genetic signature, like specific identifiable pieces of DNA code.\n\nThe genome of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of other bat coronaviruses, as well as those of pangolins, all of which have a similar overall genomic architecture. Differences between the genomes of these coronaviruses show natural patterns typical of coronavirus evolution. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 evolved from a previous wild coronavirus.\n\n Some scientists have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may have come from another known bat virus (RaTG13) found by researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The genomes of these two viruses are 96% similar to one another.\n\nThis might sound very close but in evolutionary terms this actually makes them significantly different and the two have been shown to share a common ancestor. This shows that RaGT13 is not the ancestor of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nIn fact, SARS-CoV-2 most likely evolved from a viral variant that couldn't survive for a long period of time or that persists at low levels in bats.\n\n#bats #batvirus #pandemic #pandemic2020 #virus2020 #virus #covid #covid19 #scientist #sci #pharmsci #pharmacyblog #pharmacyawarness #pharmacist #pharmaclass #sarscov2 #sars #epidemic","NumberOfLikes":16,"Hashtags":["#bats","#batvirus","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#virus2020","#virus","#covid","#covid19","#scientist","#sci","#pharmsci","#pharmacyblog","#pharmacyawarness","#pharmacist","#pharmaclass","#sarscov2","#sars","#epidemic"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597591789,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 16 17:29:49 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Pandemic day154: Mini cheddar bay biscuits #cheddarbaybiscuits #biscuits #alexcooksyum #pandemicbaking #pandemic2020 #breadtime","NumberOfLikes":14,"Hashtags":["#cheddarbaybiscuits","#biscuits","#alexcooksyum","#pandemicbaking","#pandemic2020","#breadtime"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Alexandra Burke on August 16, 2020.

Scientists suspect that they contracted the virus by eating or touching an animal who was infected.\n_\nThis is yet another reason why we should all be #vegan.\n_\nIt's bad enough that the consumption of #meat and other animal-based foods contributes to #heartdisease, #diabetes and #cancer, and that harmful bacteria found in the intestines and faeces of #animals, including salmonella and E coli, often cause outbreaks of food poisoning. Do we really want to add more deadly animal-borne diseases into the mix?\n_\nMany devastating disease outbreaks come about because humans house animals in filthy, severely crowded farms and markets \u2013 breeding grounds for pathogens \u2013 in order to satisfy their meat habits.\n_\nIt's not at all unusual for viruses and other pathogens to jump from animals into the human population. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 75% of emerging infectious diseases originate in animals. Kevin Olival, a disease ecologist and conservationist at EcoHealth Alliance, says, \"When you bring animals together in \u2026 unnatural situations, you have the risk of human diseases emerging.\" In other words, many devastating disease outbreaks come about because humans house animals in filthy, severely crowded farms and markets \u2013 breeding grounds for pathogens \u2013 in order to satisfy their meat habit.\n_\n#rethink #govegan #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife #pandemic #covid19 #govegan #veganism #tryit #animallover #dogs #cats #puppy #kitten #veganfortheanimals\n#vegan #veganactivism #truth #backtoschool","NumberOfLikes":30,"Hashtags":["#COVID-19","#vegan.","#meat","#heartdisease,","#diabetes","#cancer,","#animals,","#rethink","#govegan","#pandemic2020","#pandemiclife","#pandemic","#covid19","#govegan","#veganism","#tryit","#animallover","#dogs","#cats","#puppy","#kitten","#veganfortheanimals","#vegan","#veganactivism","#truth","#backtoschool"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":21,"Timestamp":1597537817,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 16 02:30:17 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#SocialDistancing Level 153: Negan.","NumberOfLikes":19,"Hashtags":["#SocialDistancing"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Eric \"Buzz\" Kovac in The Compound with @thewalkingdead, @hardwick, @amcthewalkingdead, @amctalkingdead, @amc_tv, and @jeffreydeanmorgan.

The pandemic has certainly changed things, it\u2019s not what it used to be and the show I worked last night wasn\u2019t even the usual company I work for! \n\nIt\u2019s been a couple years since I worked for @cwe.canada and it\u2019s an environment I truly missed. Every locker room has similarities and every one of them has differences. The difference I enjoy with CWE is actually change, the roster always can change and you can work with a multitude of peers that you haven\u2019t before from other provinces and promotions. A few of my favourite moments were filming promos with people I\u2019ve known for years but never worked with like @lumberjack_larrywoods and @the_cheetahbear . \n\nBeing a travelling roadshow of a promotion CWE isn\u2019t without a heathy dose of new experiences and learning opportunities as well, like trying to amass a float for the door at 6pm on a Friday night when banks are closed because a truck broke down and the float would be late to putting together a newly built ring for the first time. But no matter those hurdles or any other the company always persevered and puts on a great show from bell to bell  that engages and entertains the fans.\nI can say without any embellishment that I really missed working with CWE.\n\nCovid 19 has changed the world in so many ways, it could be another 6 months or more before I work another show, but I\u2019m glad I had the opportunity to get out there with my peers and in front of a crowd again. The tight suit also reminded me its time to drop a few lbs.

My daughter developed concerning symptoms on Friday night and we were directed to wait until our PCP opened the next morning. The waiting was awful. üò∞ All the unknowns came flooding in. When the office finally opened we were directed to a virtual visit because she had symptoms. The option to possibly come in for lab draws\/tests if needed was on the table. Well apparently weekend COVID-19 testing wasn\u2019t accessible to our PCP. üòß But they were happy to prophylactically treat her strep! Wait hold on a minute. We don\u2019t know if she has strep or a cold or a virus or COVID-19, but let\u2019s fill her with an antibiotic and make her wait for a COVID-19 test. Seems like a great plan. ü§® However waiting for the test not only affected our family, but puts all the staff, children and parents of our daycare and anyone else she\u2019s been around at risk which I was so uncomfortable with. And not knowing if she has strep affects our son. He\u2019s at risk for a rheumatic fever flare up if he\u2019s exposed. We didn\u2019t want to put him through a strep test if we don\u2019t even know whether or not our daughter has strep. He was more then welcome to come in and get a strep test, but not the child who has symptoms. Does that seem right? \n\nI get that precautions have to be in place but this whole situation just doesn\u2019t sit well. Thankfully we have a wonderful children\u2019s hospital in our town who was more then happy to see her, evaluate her and test her for both strep and COVID-19 today!  The rapid strep test was negative! ü•≥ No antibiotic for her and no unnecessary testing for our son. üôåüèº We still don\u2019t have access to rapid COVID-19 testing so we\u2019re hoping for the 24hr timeframe turnaround vs the 72hr time frame. ü§ûüèºAnd lastly thank you to everyone who has reached out and supported us during these unwavering hours. Our neighbors for bringing snacks and sending love messages to our daughter so she can look out the window and smile. And our family for just being there! üíú","NumberOfLikes":21,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Heather Feingold on August 15, 2020.

Never in a million years did I think getting a mask üò∑, and checking daily temp would be part of the back to school list. This year has left me scratching my head on many occasions. The school Bailey goes to handled it very well. There was so much excitement on property! The teachers were genuinely excited to see all the kids. They made it a very special time for kids and parents. They helped lighten the load of the \u201Cshock factor\u201D of showing up to school with everyone in masks and all the different precautions in place. I am grateful that they chose to open her school. \n\nI also continue to be amazed watching my friends who are homeschooling their children. Talk about rising to the occasion and making the best of it. I have seen makeshift home classrooms(super cool by the way), activity centers, daily schedules, and most of all I\u2019ve seen parents connecting with other parents. I know these parents are being hard on themselves and going a little crazy, but please know you are doing AMAZING!! I have so much respect and admiration for you. \n\nOn a side note my heart is full seeing just how capable each of us are. It amazes me to see how we can adapt in hopes of making a better future for our children. While we may not agree with everything, for me personally I don\u2019t agree with a lot, but it\u2019s important that we continue to do and be our best for our kids and our future. Even if there are things that seem out of our control, what we choose to do within our own home could be what makes a lasting difference. There are so many of you that I\u2019ve connected with during this crazy time. I am so grateful for the connection and friendships that have come from this. I hope y\u2019all have a great weekend! \n\n#blogger #nashvilleblogger #vlogger #nashvillevlogger #backtoschool #backtoschool2020 #homeschool #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife #riseuptogether #riseabove #future #school #saturdaymood #family #friends #familyofinstagram #2020","NumberOfLikes":310,"Hashtags":["#blogger","#nashvilleblogger","#vlogger","#nashvillevlogger","#backtoschool","#backtoschool2020","#homeschool","#pandemic2020","#pandemiclife","#riseuptogether","#riseabove","#future","#school","#saturdaymood","#family","#friends","#familyofinstagram","#2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":13,"Timestamp":1597501463,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 16:24:23 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Different sizes dispensers available..\n\n1 246 831 1061 or 1 246 546 4707 \n\n#pandemic2020 #covid19 #sanitizer #clean","NumberOfLikes":1,"Hashtags":["#pandemic2020","#covid19","#sanitizer","#clean"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597501440,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 16:24:00 CEST 2020","Location":"Christ Church, Barbados"},{"CaptionText":"A message from @ankitadave_1 üòáüáÆüá≥\n.\n.\n.\nFollow @xappie.bollywood \n\n#AnkitaDave #bollywood #actress #happyindependenceday #covid19 #staysafe #stayhygiene #pandemic2020 #hindiactress #bollywoodindustry #hindifilms #actresslife #messagetoall #independence2020 #hindifilmindustry #xappiebollywood","NumberOfLikes":8,"Hashtags":["#AnkitaDave","#bollywood","#actress","#happyindependenceday","#covid19","#staysafe","#stayhygiene","#pandemic2020","#hindiactress","#bollywoodindustry","#hindifilms","#actresslife","#messagetoall","#independence2020","#hindifilmindustry","#xappiebollywood"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Xappie on August 15, 2020 tagging @ankitadave_1.

But I push myself, I even saw someone laugh at me because I always get off the bike when the big vehicles passing by. I was always talking to myself that , \" Don't be afraid, you can do it. Trust God\". \n\nAfter all those things I finally found myself arriving to my destination.  I was catching my breath and trembling. I was soo happy. I can't explain what I feel. I even cried a little because I can't believe  that I went that far.

Previously I read an anthology of poetry and loved it. This is an anthology of letters and I knew I had to make it mine as soon as I lay eyes on it. It's beautiful to say the least.\n\n#bookreviewüëá\n\n\"You never came to stay; you never left to return. I never loved to un-love you, and that is the tragedy of my ordinary life.\"\n\n'With Love' is a collection of letters, each very deep and special in its own way. There's a longing for lost love and friendship. There are letters that talk of estranged relationships, and others which speak of people who you felt the closest to not having enough time for you. And then, there are letters which are ambiguous and reading through them you can't figure out who's written them to whom unless you reach the very end. These letters make you raise some very important questions, questions which you try answering but can't. \n\nThere were letters which made me smile, others which made me cry, a few which reminded me of people who have been a part of my life in the past and others that I have loved. There were a few that made me keep the book down and made me sympathise with people who have lived through tragedies. There are letters that talk about ends and others about beginnings. Some about heartbreaks, others about hope. Some about love and others about fear. \n\nA letter made me raise a very important question which was- How do you decide it's time to leave a friendship, a relationship, even a marriage?\nThere was one letter in particular which made me realise how we often contemplate things and don't do them and regret it later. And one made me think how we feel stupid for our actions when in reality all they are is cute. \n\nAll in all this anthology of letters was full of realisations for me. It evoked feelings that I didn't know existed within me. It brought about a flurry of emotions and I was forced to sit back and reflect and give myself closure on things that lie there hanging. It was a book which proved helpful to me in a way no one ever has.\n\nRead it to feel things. Read it to reminisce a beautiful past and be assured that a great future lies ahead.","NumberOfLikes":332,"Hashtags":["#qotd-","#bookreviewüëá"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by JAPNEET\u2022BOOKSTAGRAM\u2022IN üáÆüá≥ in Delhi, India with @booknerdparadise, @booksparks, @penguinindia, @ttt_official, @penguinbooks, @flatlay_gallery, @flatlay, @theb00kstagram, @flatlayindia, @ig.reads, @igreadsindia, @mybookfeatures, @midlandbooksofficial, @bookishladiesclub, @flatlaysquad, @bookishfeatures_, @perksofbookstagram, @bookreviewfeatures, and @flatlayphotographers.","NumberOfComments":57,"Timestamp":1597491616,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 13:40:16 CEST 2020","Location":"Delhi, India"},{"CaptionText":"Help, I got \"Pussy Monster\" by Lil Wayne stuck in my head and it won't go away ü•¥ #ButFirstASelfie #SelfiesForSelfLove #SelfieNation #SelfieGram #PhotoOfTheDay #Quarantine #Pandemic #Pandemic2020 #Coronavirus #Covid #Covid19 #Kawaii #KawaiiGirl #KawaiiGoth #BubbleGoth #PastelGoth #PastelGrunge #AltGirl #AltGirls #AlternativeGirl #AlternativeGirls #Thicc #ThickChick #NewHair #DyedHair","NumberOfLikes":18,"Hashtags":["#ButFirstASelfie","#SelfiesForSelfLove","#SelfieNation","#SelfieGram","#PhotoOfTheDay","#Quarantine","#Pandemic","#Pandemic2020","#Coronavirus","#Covid","#Covid19","#Kawaii","#KawaiiGirl","#KawaiiGoth","#BubbleGoth","#PastelGoth","#PastelGrunge","#AltGirl","#AltGirls","#AlternativeGirl","#AlternativeGirls","#Thicc","#ThickChick","#NewHair","#DyedHair"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by üç≠ü¶Ñ UnicornPlushy ü¶Ñüç≠ on August 15, 2020.

They were providing pedicure\/manicure outdoors on their side walk, guys how genius is that, huh? I then just flipped my car around and drove back to check it out. I had to sign a waiver to have a pedicure which I did. They did not have a massage chair available so I just had a pedicure Brazilian style with a container wrapped in a plastic cover and filled with water. There was a glass separating the pedicure lady and I. Everyone was wearing masks, gloves, they had some sort of tents put in place to try to minimize the high heat. The lady told me it was their first day having customers in that setting outdoors. My feet were a walking disaster. I felt such relief and excitement to know I could have my needs met. On the other hand as I started talking to the pedicure lady she told me she was from Anaheim (3 hours away with traffic from my city) and that she had a son who just started having distance learning). I could not help thinking to myself: \u201Cwho is taking care of her family needs?\u201D We are dealing with a horrible pandemic where so many people are struggling to make ends meet. Some of us are in a position of privilege with access to a stable income, we have our bills paid, food in our fridges but how about everyone else? It just broke my heart to realize this strong lady came from far away to work under the heat to make sure her family needs were at least partially met. I left the outside tent sweating and those hard workers were probably going to stay there all day long. I gave her a bigger tip in cash, got her card. I wished her the best of luck and told her to stay safe and be strong! Her name was Regina and she is one in a million of workers out there in the trenches who desperately need and want to work but due to the circumstances are laid off or fired. Unemployment is skyrocketing. Please let\u2019s keep in mind our fellow brothers and sisters who need our support right now. Any act of kindness would make a huge difference in their lives. We need to reach out to others right now more than ever. Could I count on you? Let\u2019s do it!","NumberOfLikes":16,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":9,"Timestamp":1597470552,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 07:49:12 CEST 2020","Location":"Oceanside, California"},{"CaptionText":"To all my fellow brow stylists and lash technicians\n who are finally opening after 5 months closing .... good luck to you all go out there and smash it  you got this üòçü•∞üòòüòò.\n\n-\n-\n-\n#hdbrowstylists #hdbrowstylist #hdbrowsofficial #brows #nouveaulashesuk #lvllashtechnician #goodluck #reopening #pandemic2020 #covid19 #bestwishes #bestwishesforyou","NumberOfLikes":11,"Hashtags":["#hdbrowstylists","#hdbrowstylist","#hdbrowsofficial","#brows","#nouveaulashesuk","#lvllashtechnician","#goodluck","#reopening","#pandemic2020","#covid19","#bestwishes","#bestwishesforyou"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ùòº ùôèùô§ùô™ùôòùôù ùô§ùôõ ùòΩùôöùôñùô™ùô©ùôÆ üíã in Manchester, United Kingdom with @hdbrowsofficial, @nouveaulashesuk, and @abtinsurance.
