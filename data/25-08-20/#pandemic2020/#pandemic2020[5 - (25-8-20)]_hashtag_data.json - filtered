As we are all struggling to keep our heads above water it\u2019s more important than ever to celebrate each other in all our accomplishments, small and large. Inspiration is everywhere, believe it or not! \n\nToday, let\u2019s salute this gorgeous, go-getter Mama! Mom to two beautiful \u2013 7 and almost 1 year-old boys - Nosa Adetiba has spent the last 13 years doing her part to make the world a better place as a professional fundraiser and marketer for various national non-profit organizations.\n\nAfter many years as a member of the DMFA (Direct Marketing Fundraisers Association) -  attending luncheons, webinars, learning and networking \u2013 her experience and passion awarded her a seat at the big table. Nosa was recently appointed to join the DMFA board of directors - a huge accomplishment worthy of celebration! Women, especially women of color, are severely underrepresented on boards across the country, so every seat is a win and a step in the right direction.\n\nIn addition, Nosa also sits on the board of She Builds Lives, a non-profit focused on educating economically disadvantaged children in her native Nigeria. How does she find the time to balance two kids, a non-profit career, and two board of director appointments while navigating a pandemic? This Mama\u2019s got Mojo, that\u2019s how!\n\n\u201CJuggling career and motherhood isn\u2019t always easy, especially during a pandemic, but I\u2019m doing my best to keep things as \u2018normal\u2019 and fun as possible for my sons, especially my 7 year old.

This is primarily because we shutdown schools during the spring and went into summer break. Most kids have been home for months. As you make these decisions for your family, I recommend that you listen to your state\u2019s chief epidemiologist. I urge you to look at numbers not only in your state but also in your county.For instance, CA is going to look very different from UT and SLC county may look different from Utah County.\n\nSusceptibility and Transmission:ü¶†ü§íüò∑\nSwipe üëâüèΩ to see the CDC chart on transmission by age. We see 4x lower COVID19 cases in kids and 9X lower rates of death due to COVID19.Talk to your school about all the precautions they are taking to keep their caregivers and kids safe.¬†\n\nYou also have to consider the testing rates in kids. This is an invasive nasopherangeal swab. Therefore, if most kids are asymptomatic or have very minor systems, parents are not running to get their kids tested.\n\nImmune system response in kids üë∂üèΩ üß´ü¶† \nKids have fewer or less mature ACE2 receptors on their lung surface. The SARS-CoV-2 virus binds to the ACE2 protein in order to enter the cell.Of course getting tissue samples from children can be very challenging.¬†\n\nHowever, in one study, researchers examined the expression of ACE2 in nasal epithelium in 305 patients with 4 cohorts.They found that the expression of ACE2 was lowest in the youngest cohort (ages 4-9).¬†\n\nThere are also some studies to understand if kids have trained immunity and a higher¬†constitutional lymphocyte count. This may be due to the exposure of other coronaviruses in daycare settings.¬†¬†\n\nContinued on stories...\n\n#covid19 #pandemic2020 #covid19facts #sciencefacts #scienceisreal #backtoschool2020 #covid19kids #workingmomkind #lunchideasforkids #kidsimmunity #immunesystem #scientistlife #scientistsofinstagram #vegeterianlife #knowyourfacts #coronavirususa #cdcguidelines #dataanalytics #datascience #womeninscience #womeninstem #womenscientists #momsofinstagram #toddlermealideas","NumberOfLikes":47,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":26,"Timestamp":1597437765,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 14 22:42:45 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"üòÇKIZLAR ACELE EDƒ∞N FARMASƒ∞DEN KARGO KAMPANYASI GELDƒ∞ ü§£üëèüëèüëèüíïüíï\n.\n.\n.\nSƒ∞PARƒ∞≈ûLER ƒ∞√áƒ∞N DM L√úTFEN üíïüíïüì©üì©üíãüòÇ\n#farmasicim #farmasiruj #farmasiparf√ºm #farmasiofficial #farmasit√ºrkiye #farmasikozmetik #farmasioje #aras #pttkargo #yurti√ßikargo #t√ºrkiye#pandemic2020 #korona #saƒülƒ±k","NumberOfLikes":3,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ‚ú®üí´kozmetikmarketimmüí´‚ú® on August 14, 2020.

As schools get ready to re-open in September after a long quarantine break, this has been a very difficult time and a confusing decision to make for parents. \n\nI met my neighbor yesterday and she asked me what I was planning to do. When I told her, she felt so re-assured that she had someone who had decided the same as her. \n\nI think in these confusing times, every parent wants that support and re-assurance about the decision that they have made. But everyone cannot have the same decision. Everyone has different age kids, different work circumstances and different set of issues leading upto that decision. While, it\u2019s an ongoing decision about what\u2019s the right thing to do, I don\u2019t think there is one right answer for anyone and I want to tell all parents that whatever decision you have taken today, it\u2019s the right one for you and your family and you have done the right thing for your kids and they will be okay as long as you support them throughout this phase whether they are at home or at school üòä\n\nAs for me, my kids will be going back to school in September and the most important part in this decision was taking the kids opinions in consideration and they both are very comfortable with the idea of going back to school üíñ\n\nIf anyone is having a hard time thinking about this confusion situation you can always dm me.

[This pic taken by their little\u2019s] This couple deserve a parents of the year award for making a move during a pandemic! .\n. \n. \nHere\u2019s the brief synopsis: 9 years ago we helped Josh and Victoria when they were newlyweds buy their first home. In the meantime, their family grew. They had 3 kids and decided to make a move to a larger more spacious home in 2020. Their careers were expanding and all was looking bright. .\n. \n. \nWe were delighted at the beginning of this year to hear from them asking for our help again! We were happy to give them staging advice and set them on the path to sell and buy. We had gotten partial photos of the house as the house preparations were underway. We were getting them ready to list and to home shop. Then, BAM! A pandemic hit... A quarantine happened. .\n. \n. \nWhat a roller coaster ride to get from point A to point B. Listing virtually. Showing virtually. Home shopping virtually. What a stressful experience for the kids. .\n. \n. \nEven once everything was under contract, then getting it closed safely and smoothly was not easy. We are grateful everything came together. And this beautiful family is now happily settled into their new home! .\n. \n. \nPlease take a moment to help me congratulate them! They deserve a medal!

In addition, I have a fulfilling marriage and a fulfilling job, coaching, great friends and family.\nü¶ã\nTo let the emotions flow freely is the key to flourish and prosper in chaos. \nü¶ã\nIt's not that every day is great.That's perfectly normal.There are days, just recently again, when I feel my emotions very strongly, both positive and negative. That day, on a scale of 0-10, I was feeling on an 8 with feeling strong negative emotions. With one of my tools, I recovered quickly and returned to zero in a neutral state. \nüíß\nAre you feeling your emotions, naming them or running away from them?\nüíß\nI learned how to live powerfully with strong, deep emotions, to express them and not to fight against them anymore. Emotions are energy in flow. It is so important that they flow freely in you and your body. They are great messengers. Emotions are there to be felt and want to be felt and expressed. Our analytical mind cannot do this. \n\nNegative feelings are not bad, because they wake you up. But it is important not to dwell in them for too long, because as soon as we feel negative feelings, we make room for negative thoughts at the same time and this can harm us and others.\n\nTo feel, a strong anger in my stomach or I feel very sad or the fear flows through me, is okay. \nüíß\nIf emotions do not flow freely, this often show up in physical symptoms such as tension headaches, back pain or shallow breathing...Why? Because you hold the emotion in your body, in your tissues and do not let go.\n‚¨áÔ∏è\nMy motto: Feel deeply, live powerfully!\nüëáüèª\nShare with us in the comments how you deal with your strong feelings?\n\n~~~\n#HSP#highlysensitivepeople#highlysensitiveperson #highsensitivity#sensitive#empaths#nature #ayurveda#yoga#coachingonline#meditation#newworld#pandemic2020#sacredpath#entrepreneurs #emotions#wellbeing #womenshealth#health#womenempowerment#emotionalhealth#womenleaders#positivepsychology #positivepsychologycoaching #emotionalintelligence#entrepreneurlife #personalgrowth #stressrelief#findyourpeace#stressless","NumberOfLikes":31,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Wholistic & MindsetCoach on August 14, 2020.

What is freedom? Who can have freedom? Where is it found? It\u2019s a hot topic I know.\n.\nMy app says, \u201Cexemption from external control, interference, regulation, etc.\u201D hmmm...is anyone truly free? If this year has taught us anything, it\u2019s that we are definitely not exempt from external control, interference and regulation. This #pandemic2020 has certainly done that.\n.\nWe are all bound by restrictions of and in life. Yet there is hope! There is a freedom we can all have. The secret is in written in the words of this pic. Read it. The first, most important thing to realize is in the last sentence. There will be a day when we all bow to the Lord Jesus, whether we are alive or not, willingly or not so willingly. Your choice. Choose wisely friend. \n.\nSecondly, even Jesus, who is God himself, became as a slave and submitted to his Father\u2019s will. He gave up his freedom in heaven and became human like us. Crazy, huh? Who would do that?! Only one who wanted our freedom to be found so much, that he gave up his momentarily. What a savior! Let him be your Lord! He won\u2019t ever let you down. \n.\nLastly, is the key for us. We should have the same attitude or mind as Him. We should humble ourselves, not demand our own way, but rather be humble in this life. That is where true freedom is. That\u2019s the only #truefreedom to be found.\n.\nHave a blessed day! #freedomfriday #findingfreedom","NumberOfLikes":9,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Tricia Downard on August 14, 2020.","NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1597423415,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 14 18:43:35 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"An author's gotta eat!\nCopycat Chipottle green tomatilla salsa.\n\nI had no idea how easy some of these recipes are. #IsolationTheSeries #pandemiclife #STAYingHOME #pandemic2020 #learningathome #cooking #pandemiccooking #chipotle #copycat #copycatrecipe #greenchile #getinmybelly #pandemictimes #covid19 #staywoke #stayinside #cookingideas #cookingauthor #barbacoatacos #barbacoa","NumberOfLikes":14,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Tammy Bird, author on August 14, 2020.

The idea is to NOTICE, to OBSERVE, to CONNECT to yourself. \n\nTHAT is the gift of slowing down. It gives us space to know what\u2019s going inside so we can become more aware. In turn, our increased awareness can help us make choices that align with how we want to feel and live. It\u2019s how we take responsibility for our lives. It\u2019s how we can create a life that feels good inside and out. \n\nSo, although many challenges have risen, which we are still are facing, I hope we, as an entire nation, continue to see the value in slowing down! May we continue to be creative and find ways to do so even after this crisis is over. Like any experience, feel what needs to be felt, release what no longer serves you and bring with you the lessons to move forward mindfully. \n\nHow does that sound? I\u2019d love your thoughts on the impacts of the pandemic in your life. \n\nMuch love ü§ç \n\n#slowliving #slowdown #mindfulness #mindfulliving #pandemic2020 #covid19 #inspiritation #connecttosource #connecttoself #onelove #notice #beanobserver #selfawareness #awareness #mindset #mindsetcoach #mindfulnesscoaching #yoga #meditation #practicepracticepractice #journaling #naturelover #breathe #motivationblogger #insights #coachingtips","NumberOfLikes":15,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Connie Maluorni on August 14, 2020.

Not that anyone needs to give a reason as to why they choose to do something, but it is 100% the right choice for our family at this point. \u2063\n\u2063\nThis is what a typical conversation sounds like lately.\u2063\n\u2063\nQ: Why do you want to send them back to school?\u2063\n\u2063\nA: They need to be at school. We struggled a lot with online learning in the spring and know that Isla will do much better and thrive in a school environment again. Nash too is also so excited to start JK and we want him to experience it no matter what it looks like.\u2063\n\u2063\nQ: Are you not worried about the long term affects and what they will feel seeing everyone in masks and gloves all the time?\u2063\n\u2063\nA: No. I am worried about the long term affects of NOT going back to school. As for masks, in 10 years from now we will talk and my kids will say \u201Cremember that time we had to go back to school and wear masks? That was crazy eh?\u201D I don\u2019t feel like having to wear masks and seeing people wear masks will cause them future struggles, IMO.\n\u2063\nQ: Are you not scared of everything that could happen?\u2063\n\u2063\nA: When the whole pandemic started, I chose not to live in fear. Fear gets you nowhere, fast. We respect what\u2019s happening, take the proper precautions and have instilled all of those things with our kids including the importance of hand washing, distancing and masks. I have to be confident that other people will be doing the same and that the schools have everyones safety as their first priority.\u2063\n\u2063\nAll of this being said, if things take a drastic turn, or the school year starts and I am less than impressed about how things are going down, we may change how we are doing things. But, for now, the kids will be getting on that school bus with their labelled matching masks in September. \u2063\n\u2063\nWhatever you are choosing to do this school year, you have made the right choice for you and your family.

Now, a team from the University of California (UC), Riverside, is joining the effort of many other academic and industry researchers to identify new drug candidates. They have developed a machine learning drug discovery pipeline to identify hundreds of new potential drugs that could help treat COVID-19.\n\nThe drug discovery pipeline is a type of computational strategy linked to artificial intelligence\u2014a computer algorithm that learns to predict activity through trial and error, improving over time.\n\nResearchers used small numbers of previously known ligands¬†for 65 human proteins that are known to interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins, including the ACE2 receptor.\n\nNext, they trained machine learning models to predict inhibitory activity and use them to screen FDA registered chemicals and approved drugs (~100,000) and ~14 million purchasable chemicals.\nThus they were able to create a database of chemicals whose structures were predicted as interactors of the 65 protein targets. They also evaluated the chemicals for safety.\nTaking it a step further, they identified compounds among the hits that are already FDA approved, such as drugs and compounds used in food. They also used the machine learning models to compute toxicity, which helped them reject potentially toxic candidates. This helped them prioritize the chemicals that were predicted to interact with SARS-CoV-2 targets. Their method allowed them to not only identify the highest scoring candidates with significant activity against a single human protein target, but also find a few chemicals that were predicted to inhibit two or more human protein targets.\n\n#artificialintelligence #ai #pharmacyfacts #pharmacyawarness #pharmacystudent #pharmacyblog #pharmablog #covid #covid19awareness #covƒ±d19 #sarscov2 #sars #pandemic #pandemic2020 #epidemic #fda #drugs","NumberOfLikes":17,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by PharmaClass on August 14, 2020.

It was during the crisis, however, that I finally found one. Or should I say created one?\u2063\n\u2063\nLast March, I started offering custom portraits on Instagram. To my surprise, it was a success! At first, I did it to keep myself busy during Corona time and to make some extra cash. But then it became a lifestyle. \u2063\n\u2063\nFor some people, the pandemic meant loss or disadvantage; for others, like me, it represented opportunity.\u2063\n\u2063\nNot only did I find a job, but I also found a niche. If you\u2019ve been following my creative journey, you have probably seen my art style evolve. I\u2019ve come to realize that I love painting people. It helps me connect with my fellow humans and look at their souls in a way I feel I would otherwise be unable to. ‚ú®\u2063\n\u2063\nI wrote a blog post sharing my story of how I was able to create opportunity during the Pandemic and the way I think about day jobs. The link to the post is in my bio. ‚ò∫Ô∏è \u2063\n\u2063\nI hope this post encourages you to take a leap of faith and go down a new path if you\u2019re feeling called to do so. And if you, like me, saw the light of a new career or opportunity during this crazy time, share your experience in the comments. \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#faceyourart #newblogpost #imwriting #writersofinstagram #freelanceillustrator #freelancewriter #freelancelife #pandemic #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife #pandemia #pandemia2020 #corona #coronatime #thriving #customportraits #familyportraits #commissionartist #commissionedart #mixedmediaart #mixedmediaartist #coloredpencilart #coloredpencilartist #groningen #groningencity #manifestmoney #creativelife #creativelifehappylife #illustratedportrait #illustration","NumberOfLikes":53,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Jessica Araus on August 14, 2020.

Rates of suicide, domestic violence and all forms of abuse have risen astronomically. If you\u2019re blessed to have a job, security and happiness at this time - remember that the majority, are not as fortunate as you. \n\nI count my blessings, I practise gratitude - but I\u2019m prone to triggers. Lockdown makes me feel trapped and isolated, which evokes sadness & anxieties. Outdoor walks are helping me get through the days and I need only reach out - to realise, I am not alone.\n\nWe are truly in this together, I frequently FaceTime my family in the UK, my sis-in-law my girlfriends and my Uni mates, and we\u2019re all over it & feeling the same... There are common emotions & triggers we are all experiencing.\n\nI\u2019ve been so happy to notice alot of people creating music, painting & channeling their inner child whilst all this is going on. I think it\u2019s really beautiful & therapeutic - in a way, we are healing. This is a time of self-reflection and as I say often, healing often means falling first to learn later.\n\nBe kind, to yourself & those around you, try not to do things that harm you. Be accountable, open up to those you trust, splurge on things that are good for you. Before you fire up, attempt to understand where your fear is coming from. Communicate honestly, choose vulnerability instead... you\u2019d be surprised how many people can relate.\n\nRegardless of your view on the situation. Don\u2019t cut yourself off, If you\u2019re feeling depression, anxiety, fear or anger; know that you\u2019re not alone. Reach out to your tribe, it\u2019s more important than ever, that we\u2019re here to support one another. ‚ô•Ô∏è\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#lockdown  #covid19 #saveourchildren  #corona #pandemic2020  #viclockdown  #domesticviolence  #abuse #healing  #therapy  #heal  #pandemic  #covid  #bloggers  #photography  #typography  #wordsmith  #middleeasternmusic  #shortpoetry #thelatestquote  #goodvibes  #lifequotes  #love  #poetrycommunity  #poem  #poet  #poems  #quotes  #writer","NumberOfLikes":41,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ·àçÍ™ë\u200BÍ´Ä\u200BÍ´Ä\u200Bùò≥\u200BÍ™ñ üá¶üá∫üá¨üáßüáÆüá™üá¶üá™ in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

Evening walk along the Thames. Absolutely love London,  but what\u2019s happening here? It feels way off from being back to normal with many businesses, restaurants, shops, hotels etc still closed and certain socialising restrictions still in place. When we arrived via the channel tunnel and stopped at a filling station only half the people wore a mask and there was this polite sign saying \u201CThanks for wearing a mask\u201D whereas in Germany the sign said \u201Cmask mandatory, do not enter without one\u201D. You get fined EUR 150 without a mask over there whereas here the shopkeeper still smiles at you. No Corona test necessary when you return from a high risk country, only a request that you self isolate for 10 days. In Germany the fine is EUR 25.000 for not doing the test and it turns out that 20% of all new Corona cases are imported cases which shows how important mandatory tests are. I don\u2019t get the Laisser-faire attitude of our government.

Both are true at the same time.\u2063\n\u2063\nFor those that are parents, the difficult job of parenting is further complicated this year due to the pandemic, no matter what your individual situation.\u2063\n\u2063\nDr. Kristin Neff writes about Self-Compassion, and it is one of the most grounding things I believe we can apply to parenting.\u2063\n\u2063\nShe describes self-compassion like this:\u2063\n\"Instead of mercilessly judging and criticizing yourself for various inadequacies or shortcomings, self-compassion means you are kind and understanding when confronted with personal failings \u2013 after all, who ever said you were supposed to be perfect?\"\u2063\n\u2063\nThe 3 ingredients necessary (according to Neff, summarized by me) for self-compassion are:\u2063\n\u2063\n1. Self-kindness vs. Self-judgment:\u2063\nWe are warm and understanding to ourselves when we suffer, fail or feel inadequate, instead of beating ourselves up internally.\u2063\n\u2063\n2. Common humanity vs. Isolation:\u2063\nKnowing you are not the only one...recognizing that suffering and personal inadequacy are a part of all of our human experience.\u2063\n\u2063\n3. Mindfulness vs. Over-identification:\u2063\nThe balance of naming how you feel with compassion, without stuffing it, or without being swept away by it. \u2063\n\u2063\nThese 3 ingredients applied to parenting could look like:\u2063\nI am not parenting my child today in the way that I want to. I am having a hard time being as present or as patient as I want to be today. I notice that I am so tired. And I know I am not the only parent struggling with this right now. Even though I want to do better, beating myself up about it will not help. I need some tenderness, some rest, and the understanding that I can start over at any moment, even now.\u2063\n\u2063\nCheering on all parents today‚ù§Ô∏è.","NumberOfLikes":108,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Monica DiCristina, LPC on August 13, 2020.

We live too far from each other to go out and drink a ChaiÃà latte. üôä Instead we love to spend time talking on the phone sharing our thoughts about life and discussing society. How we as humans act and behave, and how magical the universe actually is. I met so many \npeople on my journey, but never someone like him. He is a beautiful rare soul with a very unique vision on the world. üåçüíô It\u2019s no coincidence that I asked him for an interview about love.

For me love is dissolving yourself with everything surrounding you. Being able to experience no sense of separation creates an ultimate feeling of freedom which is an essential element in love. When you emerge with everything you feel a deeper connection with so many things like food, music, nature, even the stars and the moon. ‚ú®üåñ\nWhat will make you more grounded and at ease. This form of connection and freedom will make it possible for you to trust the process of life. üôåüèª\n\nOff course self love is a fundamental key is we speak about love. You need to experience it first. How can you explain to someone how sugar tastes if you never tried it? How can you write a poem or a song about love if you were never able to feel loved? How can you share love if you don\u2019t have a clue what it means and if you\u2019re not capable of giving it to yourself first? ü§∑üèª\u200D‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\n... to be continued on my site\n \n¬©Ô∏è @subtle_balance","NumberOfLikes":44,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by \u2022 ùïäùï¶ùïìùï•ùïùùïñ ùîπùïíùïùùïíùïüùïîùïñ \u2022 in Somewhere in the Universe. with @bhavnath.

Alka Joshi is the latest addition to the list.\n\n#bookreviewüëá\n\n\"That was what I wanted: a life that could fulfill me in a way that children wouldn't.\"\n\nAlka Joshi's first novel is nothing short of a masterpiece. The book is filled with beautiful metaphors, woven with intricacies, is rich with colour and textures and takes you back to the India of the 1950s. The story is set in Rajasthan and takes the reader into a romantic setting, a setting which is so potently visual that I could actually picturise the scenes. \n\n'The Henna Artist' is the story of Lakshmi and of all those women who choose to stand up for themselves. Of women who are ambitious and who will take anything in their stride. Known for her herbal Henna and unmatched and unique Henna designs and her way around herbs and how they can be used to cure many ailments. Lakshmi Shastri sets out to make a good life for herself, escaping her abusive marriage from a small, unknown village to the Pink City- Jaipur and when she's close to having it all she is confronted with her past and her dreams are threatened once again. But her 'never give up' attitude makes her persevere. Will her rational and pragmatic approach to life make her succeed? Well, there's only one way to find out. By reading the book!\n\nThe author picks up many issues and deals with each one of them wonderfully. At no point does anything seem forced or unnecessary and that is one of the feats of the novel. I absolutely loved the nuanced plot and how the author so cleverly drops in the details which never seem extra. The idea of 'Karma' is never mentioned but is definitely played upon. The book comes full circle and the ending is just perfect and leaves you wanting for more.\n\nThis book is a rare gem. Treasure it. Read it.\n\nRead it for the #diasporauthoreadathon by me, @preadsbooks and @justanotherbibliomaniac and #womenauthorsforthewin by @whosaysnotobooks.","NumberOfLikes":571,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by JAPNEET\u2022BOOKSTAGRAM\u2022IN üáÆüá≥ in Delhi, India with @harlequinbooks, @booknerdparadise, @booksparks, @harpercollins, @harpercollinsin, @reesesbookclub, @theb00kstagram, @bookstafeatures, @ig.reads, @igreadsindia, @buzzfeedbooks, @thealkajoshi, @harlequin.art.dept, @bookishladiesclub, @perksofbookstagram, @shethepeoplebookclub, and @exploreindianliterature.

If you haven\u2019t been keeping up with my situation here in New York City, then let me briefly tell you. So, back in march I lost my job because of the pandemic. That was really tough because I was self-employed. I spent two months trying to get my PUA (pandemic unemployment benefits) while temporarily on SNAP (welfare) because I lost my job. That was a pain, but I finally got my PUA, thank God. After that I researched and applied to a bunch of companies online. Many declined me and only two accepted my application. I chose to go with the company that I liked better. So then I got my first interview. The first interview was by phone. After that, I was asked to get interviewed again but face-to-face in a virtual setting. I did that and was told that I\u2019ll get feedback in a day or two. When I didn\u2019t hear back from my recruiter after two days, I sent her a follow up email asking about the postion. Later the next day she got back to me, said sorry for the delay and was waiting for more information from the hiring team. She then said that she\u2019d call me later on today. So, I waited and waited while praying to God that I get the job, because I really like it and need it! Then around 3:30PM my recruiter called me and said I\u2019ve got the job!!! SubhanAllah! Glory be to God! Alhamdulillah! I thanked God and then told my recruiter how happy I was to have been hired!!! So, after many months of worrying about how I was going to provide for my family and I, and after a lot of prayers and trust in the Creator, He has made a way for me. Alhamdulillah, praise be to God. \nFor those of you who have been with me through this crazy time, thank you. I really appreciate your kind words, encouragement and support. If you haven\u2019t followed me on my account @lionbeardkhannyc then I invite you to do so. I\u2019m still doing NYC walking videos, showing you around New York City. I still plan on writing\/journaling what\u2019s going on here and with my situation. The only addition is that I post videos and goofy things here and there, and share with you more about myself. Again, thank you and thank you for reading!... A new chapter awaits and the journey continues. üï∂ - Khan","NumberOfLikes":5,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Lion Beard Khan | NYC in New York City, N.Y..

Trauma can be a ruthless thief, entering quickly and violently, taking whatever it desires.

Located just up the hill from the \u201CSnow White Cottages\u201D in Los Feliz - on Lyric Avenue - you\u2019ll find the identical homes of Walt & Roy Disney! \n\nFollowing the success of their first cartoon character \u201COswald the Lucky Rabbit\u201D in 1926, Walt and Roy bought an empty lot on Lyric Avenue in Los Feliz (not far from their new Disney Hyperion Studios) and built matching homes next door to each other! \n\nAfter construction was completed, Walt and Lillian moved into their home at 2495 Lyric Avenue and Roy and Edna moved in next door at 2491 Lyric Avenue - luckily both homes still stand today! Please note that these are private residences so if you visit please do not trespass or disturb the people that live there.\n\nLittle did Walt know that his distributor, Charles Mintz, owned the rights to Oswald\u2019s cartoons. Disney wouldn\u2019t let the threat of losing Oswald get him down, as he had something bigger in the works. It was in the garage of this house that Walt, Roy, and his chief animator Ub Iwerks secretly worked on Mickey Mouse cartoons while they were still under contract with Universal Studios for Oswald. In the end, Universal ended up with the rights to Oswald, and Disney sketched a character that would eclipse Oswald in popularity: Mickey Mouse! \n\nAfter the success of Mickey Mouse and the studio\u2019s first Oscar (Silly Symphonies Flowers and Treeswon the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, the first time an award in this category was given out) the Disney\u2019s moved to Woking Way in 1932.\n\nFun fact - Walt Disney didn\u2019t draw Mickey Mouse. He did at first, but it didn\u2019t last long\u2014after 1928, Walt was no longer animating, focusing instead on story development and direction. He relied on Iwerks and other artists to do the drawing dirty work. Walt Disney did voice Mickey Mouse. From 1928 to 1947, Walt was the man behind the mouse\u2014literally. #waltdisney #lyricavenue #hollywoodhistory #mickeymouse #losfeliz #hollywoodtour #pandemic2020 #socialdistancing #wearamasküò∑ #tonymiros","NumberOfLikes":50,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1597253800,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 12 19:36:40 CEST 2020","Location":"Los Feliz"},{"CaptionText":"Don\u2019t break yourself during a pandemic.

Fun fact: Betty White is also a HUGE dog lover and VEGAN, so the name really aligned with the theme of our van life journey. And S.S.... because boat (or so Liam keeps saying ü§∑üèª\u200D‚ôÄÔ∏è).

Duke University recently published a study on August 7, 2020 which focused on which type of mask is more effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19. \u2063\n\u2063\nOne of the authors and Associate Professor of Medicine at Duke University, Dr. Eric Westman, says the study is one of the first that focuses on masks made for community use, such as cotton masks or bandanas. \u2063\n\u2063\nResearchers tested 14 different types of commonly used masks that they have seen used in communities. They wanted to figure out which masks are good and which are bad. The study used a laser, camera, and black box to visualize the respiratory droplet particles that we don\u2019t readily see. A subject would then say, \u201Cstay healthy people\u201D five times, and the number of particles dispersed would be reviewed. \u2063\n\u2063\nWhat did they find? The well-fitted N95 masks without valves and three-layer surgical masks are the safest option. However, these masks should still be reserved for health care workers who directly care for patients in the hospitals and\/or clinics with COVID-19. A cotton cloth mask with 2 or more layers is the next most reliable option. \u2063\n\u2063\nSurprisingly, the bandanas, neck fleece or gaiters didn\u2019t work well at all. These mask types did not stop the spread of particles. Instead, they were found to break down large droplets into smaller droplets that can linger in the air and spread more easily. \u2063\n\u2063\nThey also reported that N95 masks with valves may also spread the virus to others especially if the person is an asymptomatic carrier or has COVID-19.  The valve in front of the mask closes during inspiration.  But it opens during expiration allows the person to exhale infected respiratory droplets.  These masks protect the user but they definitely don\u2019t protect others nearby.\u2063\n \u2063\nWhat\u2019s the take home message? When going out, wear a mask that works. Your best option is a well-fitted cotton mask with 2 or more layers. \u2063\n\u2063\nAny questions? \u2063\n\u2063\n#wearamask #maskup\u2063","NumberOfLikes":232,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":89,"Timestamp":1597250225,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 12 18:37:05 CEST 2020","Location":"San Francisco, California"},{"CaptionText":"Team Sambal invited 10 identified households to one of its volunteer's house to handover the ration and basic hygiene kit. \nRation kit contains:\n\n10 Kgs of rice\n1.5 Kgs of pulses\n1 Kg salt\n1 L edible oil\n2 Kgs potatoes\n100g turmeric powder\n\nBasic hygiene kit contains:\n\n1 packet of detergent powder,¬†\n1 bar of bathing soap and¬†\n1 packet of sanitary napkins (wherever required)\n\nThank you ALL for the love and support.\n\nTogether we can feed more and do more for the people.\n\nDonate via this link - https:\/\/ketto.org\/s?id=FK9QXH39R (in bio)\n\nPaytm: +91-8486717282\n\nGoogle Pay: sujitmuktan.sm@okhdfcbank \/ +91-8486717282\n\n#pandemic #pandemic2020 #socialdistancing #life #covid19 #2020 #struggle #story #india #rural #village #community #survival #change #development #social #fundraiser #reachout #newnormal #poor #relief #work #workfromhome #jobs #igers #instagram #instadaily #instastory #instashare #distribution","NumberOfLikes":9,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§¨‡§≤ (Sambal) in Moran, Dibrugarh.
