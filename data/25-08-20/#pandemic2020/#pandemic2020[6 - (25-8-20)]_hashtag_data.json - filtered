Phase 4: outdoor arts and entertainment, media production, pro sports, and higher education. Check.\n\nBut there is a phase nobody is talking about. It will affect all of us, and we need a plan for it: a national plan for mourning.\n\nListen when someone wants to reminisce about their deceased; sit with them in sadness. During this pandemic we all have been confronted with bitter disappointments and shattered expectations. Loss of jobs, school disruptions, cancellations of life cycle events like graduations and weddings. Our streets look war-torn; favorite local businesses shut down permanently, unable to survive. These losses require mourning too.  \nSadness isn\u2019t reserved solely for the dearly departed. Grief is for everything we lose.\nOur country is already boiling over with rage, and now we must steel ourselves for the stages of grief \u2014 denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Its treacherous reality is that it is not a linear, logical path. In order to grieve collectively, we\u2019ll need a source of empathy that we simply do not have right now. We are all in our bunkers, scared and angry.\n\nWhen we emerge, it will be difficult to pause to grieve, given that we all need to get back on our feet. As a country, we can\u2019t force ourselves to move on too fast as if nothing happened, or act like getting back to normal is some perverted idea of closure. We have spent so much time trying to stay safe, keeping a distance, that it won\u2019t feel natural, at first, to go toward each other. We will need to strip away our fear of one another if we are going to help each other.\u201D\n\nOriginally published on Advocate.com\n\u2014 Published on August 2, 2020\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#pandemic2020 #covidanxiety #emotionaltrauma #collectivegrief #mourning #mourninginamerica #griefandloss #griefsupport #griefawareness #mentalhealthmatters #mentalwellbeing #emotionalwellbeing #mentalhealth #sadness #sorrow #grief #nami","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#pandemic2020","#covidanxiety","#emotionaltrauma","#collectivegrief","#mourning","#mourninginamerica","#griefandloss","#griefsupport","#griefawareness","#mentalhealthmatters","#mentalwellbeing","#emotionalwellbeing","#mentalhealth","#sadness","#sorrow","#grief","#nami"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Jessica Morgan MD, CIHC, CINHC in Seattle, Washington.

When they are about to cross the Red Sea and the Israelites can see Pharaoh\u2019s army coming for them and they are filled with fear. \u201CBut Moses told the people, \u201CDon\u2019t be afraid. Just stand still and watch the Lord rescue you today...The Lord himself will fight for you. Just stay calm.\u201D\u2014Exodus 14:13-14\n✨\nAs we go through the rollercoaster that is 2020 these words feel as relevant today as they were thousands of years ago when Moses spoke them. The Lord WILL fight for you. He IS fighting for you already. All we have to do is ask.\n✨\nI read an article this week about a survey recently conducted by the Pew Research Center that shows that 89% of Americans have turned to TV or movies to cope during the pandemic but only 3 out of every 10 US adults are reading the Bible at least weekly. More people are zoning out in front of the TV rather than turning to the Lord for help. So, I would like to encourage you to read your Bibles and spend time getting to know the Lord! Talk to him and ask for what you need! Even if you\u2019ve never prayed before, just start. If you have questions, ask Him. Allow Him to rescue you. We have access to the same God that parted the Red Sea and brought the Israelites out of slavery and into the Promised Land. Turning to Him should be our first reaction, not our last resort. ❤️\n\u201CAsk, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.\u201D\u2014Matthew 7:7","NumberOfLikes":12,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Maggie Rhodes on August 12, 2020.","NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1597237881,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 12 15:11:21 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"alinelruth","CaptionText":"É com muito orgulho que apresento pra vcs o Project Héroe.\nEsse time com a mais absoluta certeza, são os verdadeiros heróis.\nEspero que esse projeto ajude o nosso mundo a se recuperar mais rápido evitando tantas vidas perdidas como tivemos e ainda vamos ter por causa do Covid-19.\nPara quem quiser conhecer esse projeto maravilhoso, tem um pouquinho nos meus destaques e uma entrevista completa com o Arquiteto idealizador do projeto, David Swartz, na minha bio.\nThank you David, for let me be part of your dream team, forever grateful. \nThis is a dream for me and I\u2019m very proud of this project.

Isso significa que você estará capacitado a desenvolver um trabalho técnico e bem remunerado em apenas 2 anos!\n⠀\n2️\u20E3 EMPREGABILIDADE: Os técnicos têm vaga garantida no mercado de trabalho! Atualmente, a demanda por profissionais com capacidades técnicas tem aumentado muito. Durante o curso é possível ingressar em um estágio e construir sua carreira a partir de então.\n⠀\n3️\u20E3 CUSTO X BENEFÍCIO: É só comparar! O custo total de uma formação técnica é significativamente mais baixo que o de uma graduação. Isso certamente não impede que você faça uma graduação posteriormente, mas te proporciona retorno sobre o seu investimento de maneira mais rápida.\n⠀\n💥 Agora só falta escolher qual curso você vai fazer aqui no Colégio de Itajubá! 📚\n.\n.\n.\n#cursoonline #cursotecnico #desenvolvimentoprofissional #pandemic2020 #escolas #mercadodetrabalho #segurancadotrabalho #mecatronica #contabilidade #administração #trabalho #profissionalismo #jovens #alunos #tecnic #tecnico #empresarial #faculdades #matrículasabertas #matriculas #aulasonline #aulaonline #professores #futuros #profissao #aprendiz #estudando #estudante #itajuba #minasgerais🔺","NumberOfLikes":12,"Hashtags":["#cursoonline","#cursotecnico","#desenvolvimentoprofissional","#pandemic2020","#escolas","#mercadodetrabalho","#segurancadotrabalho","#mecatronica","#contabilidade","#administração","#trabalho","#profissionalismo","#jovens","#alunos","#tecnic","#tecnico","#empresarial","#faculdades","#matrículasabertas","#matriculas","#aulasonline","#aulaonline","#professores","#futuros","#profissao","#aprendiz","#estudando","#estudante","#itajuba","#minasgerais🔺"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Colégio de Itajubá on August 11, 2020.

Only people who have gone through this last year will know what actually happened lol. My shirt is another one of those statements that most can say \u201Ctotally relatable\u201D hahaha. Since we are on the topic I went ahead and linked some really funny shirts and items I\u2019m sure will be relatable for you;) This week is back to school week for us and many others. Whether it be in person or online. I know some have already been back in school for a week or so now. My theory is that when life has you down, make a shirt about it. Wear that shirt instead of letting it wear you. When life throws you lemons make some Damn good lemonade.\nSometimes it will be bitter but if you add some sugar it will make it sweeter.\nThis past year is a prime example of life giving us lemons. Some have chosen to make super bitter lemonade while others have chosen to add sweetener. For us it\u2019s been one of the most challenging years yet. It\u2019s also been one of the best years yet. We have grown in ways I didn\u2019t even know was possible. While I know we all joke about wanting it to stop and asked ourselves \u201Cwhat in the actual hell is going on?\u201D Have you asked yourself what was good about this year? Just for the record in this situation \u201Cgood\u201D doesn\u2019t mean things went great, it means what great things came from the \u201Cbad.\u201D This is a question that goes through my head a lot. While I know it\u2019s challenging to see the light at the end of the tunnel, it\u2019s important to see the glimmers of hope.\nLet\u2019s be real, if we only see darkness and don\u2019t allow ourselves to see the little bit of light, we will never find our way out. So ask yourself today...\u201DWhat did I get from 2020 that was a blessing in disguise?\u201D Have a great day! \nY\u2019all have to go check out the shirts I linked. They are good lol!

This is a community that is invested heavily in the tourism trade, despite its relatively remote location. Like other tourist destinations, Victoria reacted swiftly during the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic, recognizing the economic threat that loomed on the horizon. Gone are its massive cruise ships and international passengers; instead, the city is catering to local and regional Canadians seeking a homegrown experience rather than travelling abroad. \n\nTo improve social distancing, Government Street in Victoria's Old Town district has been closed to vehicle traffic, creating a new pedestrian mall that has seen cafés and restaurants spill into the street for safer al fresco dining. Tourist shops have devoted space to selling groceries and everyday essentials for locals and visitors, reducing the need to travel to larger supermarkets. The end result is a walkable, community-focused city that has some local officials pondering which changes can be made permanent beyond 2020. Although British Columbia was an early COVID-19 hotspot in Canada, diligent social distancing measures, hand washing and frequent mask usage have led to a dramatic drop in new cases - promising a swifter return to normalcy for this idyllic province.\n\nThis is the final part of our series that features Canadian communities from coast-to-coast-to-coast, highlighting their unique pandemic experiences.\n\nPhoto: Victoria, British Columbia\nCredit: Jasper Garratt\n\n#covid19 #covid #coronavirus #virus #pandemic #quarantine #quarantinelife #canada #transcanada #pandemic2020 #2020 #bc #britishcolumbia #victoria #victoriabc #yyj #vancouverisland #chinatown #urbanphotography #urban #oldtown #alley #canadian #street #streetphotography #citylife #cityphotography #cityscape #city #tourism","NumberOfLikes":19,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#covid","#coronavirus","#virus","#pandemic","#quarantine","#quarantinelife","#canada","#transcanada","#pandemic2020","#2020","#bc","#britishcolumbia","#victoria","#victoriabc","#yyj","#vancouverisland","#chinatown","#urbanphotography","#urban","#oldtown","#alley","#canadian","#street","#streetphotography","#citylife","#cityphotography","#cityscape","#city","#tourism"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Respondkits on August 10, 2020.

With the exception of moving Ben and attending his socially distanced graduation, we have been at home or Allen\u2019s office. I used have to go somewhere every few months to stay sane. However, I have found peace in being at home since March. I have been writing daily, getting outside every day walking for at least an hour (sometimes more than 1 walk a day), I have been able to give my time from home to causes that are important to me, I have let go and danced with abandon on our sunporch, I have cooked more meals in 5 months than I have in 32 years of marriage, we have had sit down family meals, I have planted and harvested beautiful flowers, I have been able to take care of my family, our clients, and my friends because I have taken the time to stop and have phone conversations about what is going on in their lives. This pandemic has given me a license to slow down and live a purposeful life with peace. I do look forward to visiting Camille soon in Washington, but will continue to stay safe and stay home when possible. Maybe a little road trip here or there.

Twenty weeks ago I initiated my nightly pandemic sign off to lift the spirits of my world wide friends during this pandemic. From the  personal messages I receive I know that my chaplaincy backstories as well as my tips for creating positive health changes have inspired people. Many of the individuals I hear from erroneously assume that writing is a large part of my career. They\u2019re surprised to hear that my writing has only recently blossomed through the magic of Instagram & Facebook. \n\nI grew up as an avid reader & though I\u2019ve always thoroughly enjoyed literature my career has been heavily weighted in the helping professions: public health educator, licensed clinical social worker, & interfaith minister. While in high school I thought of going into the medical field but was concerned about the stress of dealing with medical tragedies. The irony is not lost on me that in my role as a minister & chaplain a large part of my work revolves around death & dying. \n\nThirty-six months ago due to the nerve pain of CRPS I couldn\u2019t type or hold a pen. Though voice recognition has improved over the years my speaking style frequently resulted in an inaccurate transcription of my words which frustrated me to no end. The world of social media opened up for me once I could  handle typing on my phone. Each evening I take great care in writing my special essay & as I finish typing it I feel a sense of joy. I hope my writing touches your heart & you know that I care about you.🙏🙏🏿🙏🏾😷🌎🌏🌍#shelteringinplace #covid19 #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife #pandemic #masks #socialdistancing2020 #washyourhands #sanitizer #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealth #emotionalsupport #reachingout #buildingcommunity #instagram #facebook #socialmedia #chaplain #socialworker #healtheducator #minister #storyteller #reachingforthestars #chronicpain #helpingothers #compassionateliving #spoonie #chronicillness #crps #trysomethingnew","NumberOfLikes":35,"Hashtags":["#shelteringinplace","#covid19","#pandemic2020","#pandemiclife","#pandemic","#masks","#socialdistancing2020","#washyourhands","#sanitizer","#mentalhealthawareness","#mentalhealth","#emotionalsupport","#reachingout","#buildingcommunity","#instagram","#facebook","#socialmedia","#chaplain","#socialworker","#healtheducator","#minister","#storyteller","#reachingforthestars","#chronicpain","#helpingothers","#compassionateliving","#spoonie","#chronicillness","#crps","#trysomethingnew"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Bonnie Sluser Lester in Dublin, California.","NumberOfComments":6,"Timestamp":1597113771,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 11 04:42:51 CEST 2020","Location":"Dublin, California"},{"Owner":"_studentactivist_","CaptionText":"Hate is a virus.

It allows me to connect with the sorrow I feel for both personal and collective losses, to feel the pain without drowning in it, to make a mark on the canvas to commemorate the loss, and to reconnect with life, all while creating something meaningful. This week, I'm making marks for the Beirut explosion, the loss of the Arctic shelf in Canada, the French aid workers killed in Niger, my Eve wound, and my pandemic related losses.\u2009\n\u2009\nWhen I created my grief alchemy course, Return to Joy, I knew I wanted to include painting as a resource and I knew I wanted to share different perspectives on grief because, although loss is a universal experience, every person's journey through loss -- the void, the anger, the tears, the brokenness, the acceptance, the new self-identity, the reconciliation -- is unique.\u2009\n\u2009\nSince I'm not officially trained in Intentional Creativity, the painting practice I use, I invited Dr. Havi Mandell to share her wisdom on tending to grief through paint. She created an amazing offering. She started with a black canvas and slowly added layers that resulted in the beautiful image attached to this post, each layer representing a different aspect of the grief journey. \u2009\n\u2009\nThe magic with this painting process is that anyone can do it, whether you think of yourself as an artist or a non-creative. All you need is a canvas, paint, paintbrushes, and your willingness to be moved.\u2009\n\u2009\u2009\nFeeling brave? Sign up for Return to Joy today. The course started on Aug. 3 and runs through Sept. 20. Link to register in my bio. Cart closes on Aug 14.

We came back together in the Adirondacks and spent the day together exploring lower Saranac Lake, fishing, swimming and exploring one island after another.

The longer you allow fear to control you the bleaker life becomes. \nWhat can you do if falling into the pattern of fear, anxiety or depression.\n1- Do your best to stop fear from guiding your decisions and actions.\n2- Find something that calms you when you find yourself slipping into the grip of fear. (Prayer, meditation, music, exercise, read positive & uplifting stories).\n3- Remind yourself, all the worry in the world will never change the out come so concentrate on the things you can change and can do not what\u2019s out of your control. \n4- 2 Corinthians says to take every thought captive. That means that You have the ability  to do something about all thoughts that are not well-pleasing to God, before they enter your heart and become a part of fear, negative thinking and apart of you. \n5. Proverbs 23:7 says, As a man thinks, so is he.  What we think about is crucial to who we are, our thoughts (which are thousands a day) shape us. \n6. Our thoughts can be a battle in our own mind and we can\u2019t give into the negative thoughts, the thoughts that create fear, depression and anxiety.  Gods word is full of scripture, weapons of warfare that we can use to take every negative thought captive. \n7. Remind your self to look for the positives.

It has been very painful at times, as I realized that this business was not only my baby but it was the only place in the world that I truly felt I belonged. Thanks to the sacred pause from covid I was able to hear my Soul\u2019s longing to remember that I belong here whether or not I have this business.\n\u2009\nThis has led me to a deep state of surrender where I allowed myself to totally collapse. For the first time since I started my business 11 years ago I let go completely. I couldn\u2019t make a public announcement for 3 months - unable to come forth clearly while navigating the complex logistics led me to sit in stillness and to access that level of Truth which can only be heard in silence. Being quarantined in Panama granted me a inpouring of messages from my ancestors\/Spirit\/nature in her many forms. Strongest of all, the ocean - who\u2019s ever changing tides carry so much wisdom. \u2009\n\u2009\nSo, while this is not the way I ever thought this would happen I close the doors to this space with deep gratitude. I release control and trust life is leading me to to knowing and loving myself beyond this role I\u2019ve had the privilege to play. I\u2019ll continue to share healing, facilitate community, and create sacred space. The energy we created in this place will continue on in me and in those it touched. \u2009\n\u2009\nI have so much more to share - but for now check out the farewell video that includes my message to the community and words from 11 of the staff from over the years - 1 for every year we were in business, on the @peaceofmindsacredwellness page. \u2009\n\u2009\nAnd yes, I\u2019m gonna come back to say goodbye to you Colorado - in Sept. Come bid me farewell as I leap into the unknown. It took a leap of faith to start this business when I was 22 and it\u2019s taking a leap of faith now to close it.

A comunidade cientifica ainda não confirmou que casos de reinfecção possam acontecer nessas situação. Porém, ainda devido a falta de conhecimento sobre alguns aspectos da doença, infectologistas afirmam que é preciso estar atento para avaliar essa possivel reinfecção.\n\nHá centenas de casos de reinfecção confirmados pelas autoridades de saúde da Coreia do Sul, em abril, mas, após cuidadosa avaliação, concluíram que esses casos de reinfecção seria provavelmente resultado de fragmentos inativos do vírus, ainda presente nos pacientes.\n\nCasos isolados de possível reinfecção que aparecem no território brasileiro podem ser explicados através de diferentes motivos ou causas. Uma delas é que, após a infecção sintomatica do COVID, esse paciente não tenha se recuperado totalmente, não apresentando sintomas e, após certo tempo, possivelmente devido a imunidade, esses sintomas novamente retorne. \n\nOutra causa é a assertividade dos testes realizados, podendo ser apresentado tanto falso negativo quanto falso positivo. Nesse caso, poderia ser melhor explicado se o sistema imune do paciente mantem o vírus a níveis que impeçam os testes de identifica-lo. Dessa forma, pode-se ter uma alteração no resultado do teste. \n\nPorém é ainda necessário aguardar melhores definições da comunidade cientifica e médica, já que os coronavírus de resfriados comuns podem provocar uma memória curta de defesa do organimo. Essa memória curta está associada a produção de anticorpos por apenas 6 a 12 meses subsequentes. Como o vírus #sarscov2 também é um coronavírus, a possibilidade de reinfecção poderá ocorrer nesse período de tempo, porém não confirmado ainda por dados clinicos e estatisticos confiáveis. \n\n🧬🧪👩\u200D⚕️👩\u200D🔬\n#pandemia #pandemic2020 #nanochemtechsolutions #nanochemtech #healthy #healthtech #startup #healthtechstartup","NumberOfLikes":19,"Hashtags":["#sarscov2","#covid19.","#sarscov2","#pandemia","#pandemic2020","#nanochemtechsolutions","#nanochemtech","#healthy","#healthtech","#startup","#healthtechstartup"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1597072235,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 10 17:10:35 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"ty.heo.22","CaptionText":"#selfie #pandemic2020 #wearamask #weareinthistogether #blackandwhite","NumberOfLikes":0,"Hashtags":["#selfie","#pandemic2020","#wearamask","#weareinthistogether","#blackandwhite"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Travel-Food-Love on August 10, 2020.

Apakah semangat ikutan terhenti dan memilih berdiam diri?\n\nMemang sih selama 3 bulan at home bosen banget, bete, hidup jadi pesimis karena hidup serba tidak pasti😟 \n\nTapi tahukah kalian guys, di masa wabah ada beberapa ilmuwan yang malah menciptakan karya lho? Tengok deh👇\n\n1. Di usia 20 tahun baru masuk kuliah, Isacc Newton menghadapi wabah \"The Great Plague\". \n\nAkhirnya dia menghabiskan waktu di rumah, tapi Issac memilih untuk mengamati apel jatuh sembari menanyakan kenapa itu terjadi. Simple aktivitasnya, namun itu memicu lahirnya teori gravitasi yang sampai saat ini masih digunakan👍\n\n2. Di usia 42 tahun, William Shakespeare harus menghadapi wabah yang menelan banyak korban yang memaksanya untuk selalu di rumah.\n\nWaktu luang tak membuatnya berleha-leha, namun dia sibuk menulis sehingga tercetuslah karya fenomenalnya yang sampai saat ini masih diadaptasi dan di baca banyak orang seperti \"King Lear\", \"Macbeth\", \"Anthony\", \"Cleopatra\"👏👏\n\n3. Di saat usia 35 tahun, Boccacio mengalami kepahitan hidup gara-gara wabah Pes yang merenggut nyawa Ayah dan Ibu Tirinya.\n\nHal itu tidak mematikan semangat hidupnya, dia mampu melewatinya dengan melahirkan karya \"The Decameron\" yaitu kumpulan novelet terkait orang yang mengisolasi diri di vila selama wabah. Sampai sekarang, bukunya masih dibaca orang👌\n\n4. Di Pandemi Covid19 2020 sebenarnya banyak karya yang tercetus. Salah satunya adalah BUBUK (Bumbu-Bumbu Kehidupan)🥘\n\nYah sebuah karya kumpulan puisi menyajikan sudut pandang menghadapi ujian sebagai bumbu yang perlu di racik sehingga bisa mensupport untuk menggapai impian yg sudah dirancang🤗\n\nBUBUK adalah langkah awal untuk menorehkan jejak aksara kebaikan dalam hidup.\n\nWah gimana ya isi \"BUBUK\", penasaran?. Yuks bisa PO cuma 28K, aslinya 33K lho. Tapi tinggal 6 hari lagi nih, yuks yang belum order bisa DM atau cek @jejakpublisher ya😉\n.\n.\n#bukupuisi #puisiindah #semangatberkarya #karyaanakbangsa #pandemic2020 #covid19 #berkaryadarirumah","NumberOfLikes":53,"Hashtags":["#dirumahaja","#bukupuisi","#puisiindah","#semangatberkarya","#karyaanakbangsa","#pandemic2020","#covid19","#berkaryadarirumah"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Titah on August 10, 2020 tagging @jejakpublisher.

This weekend as I was waiting for a Zoom meeting to start I happened to glance out the window into my backyard & spied this amazing yucca plant. A year ago while shopping at my local nursery center I purchased the spiky plant to add some height & drama to my drought tolerant & low maintenance backyard. I definitely didn\u2019t know that it would produce a glorious 3\u2019 high flowering stem as it matured. What are you delightful surprise!\n\nMulling over this beautiful plant I became painfully aware of the fact that though I\u2019m in the backyard numerous times a day with my dog Roxie, I hadn\u2019t noticed the 3\u2019 stock growing until this weekend. My pandemic related work has required my undivided attention but now I have a 3\u2019 wake up call to soak in some nature..\n\n\u201CIf on any given day you don\u2019t cry from rejoicing in the beauty of the world, then you have not lived that day.\u201D Kamand Kojouri 💚🌿🙏🙏🏿🙏🏾😷🌎🌏🌍#plantsofinstagram #plants #droughttolerant #droughttolerantlandscape #droughttolerantplants #bloomingplants #backyardgarden #backyard #smelltheflowers #yuccaplant #kamandkojouri #medatative #payingattention #stressmanagement #lovingnature #tranquility #turningoveranewleaf #mindfullness #mindfulliving #contentedlife #chaplain #storyteller #zoommeeting #zoommeetings #distractionsandinspirations #covid19 #pandemic2020 #masks #shelterinplace #stayhealthy","NumberOfLikes":59,"Hashtags":["#plantsofinstagram","#plants","#droughttolerant","#droughttolerantlandscape","#droughttolerantplants","#bloomingplants","#backyardgarden","#backyard","#smelltheflowers","#yuccaplant","#kamandkojouri","#medatative","#payingattention","#stressmanagement","#lovingnature","#tranquility","#turningoveranewleaf","#mindfullness","#mindfulliving","#contentedlife","#chaplain","#storyteller","#zoommeeting","#zoommeetings","#distractionsandinspirations","#covid19","#pandemic2020","#masks","#shelterinplace","#stayhealthy"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Bonnie Sluser Lester in Dublin, California.
