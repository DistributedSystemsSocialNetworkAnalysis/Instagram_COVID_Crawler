In addition, studies show listening to music, meditating and getting enough sunlight and sleep may naturally increase your dopamine levels. For multitaskers who want to simultaneously mediate and exercise, you might want to give yoga a try. A study found that doing one hour of yoga six days a week can significantly increase dopamine levels.\u2063\n\u2063\n2️\u20E3Treat yourself\u2063\nEating out once in a while is a good way to support restaurants that have been hard-hit by the pandemic. Consider it a charitable move.\u2063\n\u2063\n3️\u20E3Laugh often\u2063\nIt\u2019s okay not to take everything too seriously. In a year that\u2019s seen its fair share of negative headlines, unplugging from the news and browsing humorous memes might be just what you need. Share a funny video with a friend, watch your favorite laugh-out-loud movie, and rewatch it again.\u2063\n\u2063\n4️\u20E3Ask for help\u2063\nIf you find yourself feeling overwhelmed (which is completely understandable), it\u2019s okay to reach out for help or support when you need it.\u2063\n\u2063\nHave you changed how you practice your self-care? \u2063","NumberOfLikes":175,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Dr. Stella C, D.O. in San Francisco, California with @dr_flosinha, @drshammout, @drsonalzhaertnsoul, @drjerath, @drsamraza, @monishavasa, @drdonnatran, @drmonicakieu, @joy.energy.time, @drartithangudu, @shreyapatelmd, @dr.ranibanik, @lifewithdrjovita_o, @dr.aleeagupta, @drtinaho, @pedsallergymd, @monicacoronelmd, @drhunnybee.md, @drjenniferchung, and @dr.avivarma.

Please note that this is a private residence so if you visit please do not trespass or disturb the people that live there.\n\nDirected by Olivia Wilde (in her feature directorial debut), \u201CBooksmart,\u201D stars Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever as high school seniors Amy and Molly -  best friends since childhood and academic overachievers - who have only cared about their grade point average their entire time in high school. But on the eve of graduation, they suddenly realize that they may have missed out on the special moments of their teenage years. Determined to make up for lost time, the girls decide to cram four years of not-to-be missed fun into one night \u2014 thus a chaotic adventure that no amount of book smarts could prepare them for ensues.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t seen this fun film yet\u2026\u201CBooksmart\u201D is currently streaming on Hulu.\n\nFun facts - Director, Olivia Wilde encouraged Kaitlyn Dever and Beanie Feldstein to spend time living together to really build up a rapport between the two girls. The two ended up being roommates for 10 weeks.\n\nIn the film, Amy is a lesbian and Molly is straight. In real life, the opposite is true: Beanie Feldstein is a lesbian and Kaitlyn Dever is straight. \n\nScreenwriter Katie Silberman said that Billie Lourd (who plays the drug-crazies Gigi) did such an impressive performance that extra scenes were written specifically for her. #filminglocation #booksmart #beaniefeldstein #pasadena #hollywoodtour #pandemic2020 #wearamask😷 #tonymiros @booksmart","NumberOfLikes":59,"Hashtags":["#filminglocation","#booksmart","#beaniefeldstein","#pasadena","#hollywoodtour","#pandemic2020","#wearamask😷","#tonymiros"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":6,"Timestamp":1596996377,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 09 20:06:17 CEST 2020","Location":"Pasadena, California"},{"Owner":"sopranodabneyrossjones","CaptionText":"Today, my solo was Margaret Bonds arrangement of He\u2019s got the Whole World in his Hands.

Coronavirus bahkan bukan yang terkecil ukuran genomnya (30.000 nukleotida) melainkan bacteriophage Phi-X174 (5.386 nukleotida). Sebagai pembanding, genom manusia ukurannya 3.100.000.000 nukleotida.⠀\n⠀\nGenom virus itu tidak stabil karena adanya faktor protein RdRp yang selalu membuat kesalahan dalam menentukan nukleotida saat dia menciptakan virus baru. Ya namanya juga protein tanpa kendali ya wajar kan membuat kesalahan. Kesalahan ini kita sebut sebagai mutasi. Pada organisme tingkat tinggi seperti manusia, DNA polimerase kita memiliki kendali dan sistem mengenali kesalahan dan memperbaikinya.⠀\n⠀\nJadi, wajar ketika kita mendengar bahwa virus bermutasi. Hal tersebut sudah menjadi kodratnya. Apakah mutasinya berbahaya? Itu hal lain. Dalam post-post berikutnya, saya akan membahas hal tersebut.⠀\n⠀\n--⠀\n⠀\nWhy is the viral genome unstable⠀\n⠀\nOf all living things in the world, viruses have the smallest genome size (the entire genetic material that makes up life). Coronavirus is not even the smallest genome size (30,000 nucleotides) but bacteriophage Phi-X174 (5,386 nucleotides). In comparison, the human genome is 3,100,000,000 nucleotides in size.⠀\n⠀\nThe viral genome is unstable due to the presence of the RdRp protein factor which always makes mistakes in defining nucleotides when it creates a new virus. For a protein without control, so it's possible to make mistakes. We call this error a mutation. In higher organisms like human, their DNA polymerase has recognition site knowing when there are mistakes and repair it.⠀\n⠀\nSo, it's only natural when we hear that viruses mutate. This has become his nature. Is the mutation dangerous? That's another thing. I will discuss this in the following posts.\n\n#biologimolekuler #biology #biologi #sarscov2 #coronavirus #kecil #pepatah #virus #dna #rna #genom #genome #genomics #mutasi #mutation #molecularbiology #indonesia #covid #covid19 #pandemic #pandemic2020 #error #repair","NumberOfLikes":110,"Hashtags":["#biologimolekuler","#biology","#biologi","#sarscov2","#coronavirus","#kecil","#pepatah","#virus","#dna","#rna","#genom","#genome","#genomics","#mutasi","#mutation","#molecularbiology","#indonesia","#covid","#covid19","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#error","#repair"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":18,"Timestamp":1596975084,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 09 14:11:24 CEST 2020","Location":"Bogor, Indonesia"},{"Owner":"kirknoland","CaptionText":"Welcome to THE BOX. \nAs Robin Williams used to say, \n\u201CWelcome to my mind\u201D\nThis is me bearing my soul and healing my mind through the revelation of story.\nArt is supposed to disturb the comfortable and comfort the disturbed.

Hal itu disinggungnya saat dalam sambutan di Kongres Luar Biasa Partai Gerindra di Bogor pada Selasa (8\/8).\n\n\"Jangan sampai kita masuk gelombang kedua. Second wave yang memperlambat kita untuk pulih kembali. Kuncinya adalah disiplin menjalankan protokol kesehatan,\" kata Jokowi.\n\nBukan pertama kali Jokowi mengingatkan bahwa Indonesia berada di tengah ancaman gelombang kedua virus corona. Hal itu pernah disampaikannya pada Mei dan Juni lalu 2020 lalu. \n\nPada akhir Mei lalu, saat memimpin ratas mengenai perkembangan penanganan COVID-19 secara virtual, Jokowi mengingatkan terjadinya potensi gelombang kedua jelang musim mudik dan arus balik pada Lebaran 2020.\n\n\"Berkaitan dengan pengendalian arus balik. Ini penting kita kendalikan agar tidak terjadi sirkulasi bolak balik dalam penyebaran virus yang berpotensi memunculkan gelombang kedua, utamanya di wilayah Jabodetabek,\" kata Jokowi saat membuka ratas.\n\nDalam Ratas Mei Jokowi juga memerintahkan Kepala Gugus Tugas Penanganan COVID-19 yang kini menjabat Ketua Satuan Tugas (Satgas) Doni Monardo dan Menkes Terawan Agus Putranto untuk fokus mengendalikan virus corona di daerah-daerah yang kurva penyebarannya masih tinggi. \n\n\"Harus saya ingatkan bahwa tugas besar kita belum berakhir. Ancaman COVID masih ada. Kondisi masih dinamis, ada daerah yang kasus barunya turun tapi juga ada daerah yang meningkat, ada yang sudah nihil,\" kata Jokowi.\n\nHal serupa kembali diulang Jokowi ketika mengunjungi Kantor Gugus Tugas Penanganan COVID-19, Jakarta Timur, Rabu (10\/6).\n\nKetika itu Jokowi mengatakan, kondisi di lapangan saat ini bersifat dinamis. Artinya, bisa saja terjadi gelombang kedua virus corona di Indonesia. \n\n\"Harus saya ingatkan bahwa tugas besar kita belum berakhir. Ancaman COVID masih ada. Kondisi masih dinamis, ada daerah yang kasus barunya turun tapi juga ada daerah yang meningkat, ada yang sudah nihil,\" kata Jokowi\n\nArtikel: kumparan.com\n\n➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖\n#news\n#virus #jokowi #covid_19 #berita_sulawesi_ #boneterkini #bonerepost #jakartahits #jakartakerasbos #jawabarat #makassarterkini","NumberOfLikes":172,"Hashtags":["#news","#virus","#jokowi","#covid_19","#berita_sulawesi_","#boneterkini","#bonerepost","#jakartahits","#jakartakerasbos","#jawabarat","#makassarterkini"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by SEPUTAR SULAWESI on August 08, 2020.

It is loaded with tons of nutrients in a low-calorie package. Dark, leafy greens like spinach are important for skin, hair, and bone health. They also provide protein, iron, vitamins, and minerals.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nThe possible health benefits of consuming spinach include improving blood glucose control in people with diabetes, lowering the risk of cancer, and improving bone health, as well as supplying minerals and vitamins that can provide a range of different benefits.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nHere are some tips to try to incorporate more spinach into a daily routine:\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n👉Add spinach to pasta, soups, and casseroles.\n👉Lightly sauté spinach in a small amount of extra virgin olive oil. Season with freshly ground black pepper and freshly grated Parmesan cheese.\n👉Add spinach to a wrap, sandwich, or flatbread.\n👉Make a dip with spinach, such as spinach and artichoke dip or spinach and goat cheese dip.\n👉Add a handful of fresh spinach to an omelet or scramble, or throw a handful into a smoothie.","NumberOfLikes":74,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Ms.Medicine on August 08, 2020.

(Link in the Bio) 🏥🩺\n We are calling our representatives, to support and cosign the Health Care Emergency Guarantee Act sponsored by Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Pramila Jayapal. The Act would use Medicare to cover all health care expenses for the duration of the crisis. By using Medicare we could quickly and efficiently expand coverage and streamline payments through a single system to hospitals and health care providers.\n\nOur nation is facing an unprecedented health crisis due to the Covid-19 pandemic. It is a life or death situation that people are able to get the medical care they need, regardless of current insurance coverage or income. Tens of millions of Americans have lost their employer-sponsored health insurance and cannot afford COBRA or options available on the marketplace.\n\nIn South Carolina, we are being particularly impacted by covid-19. At almost 100,000 cases of covid-19 and over 600,000 unemployed, people in South Carolina do not have any resources if they need any medical care. As an elected official, it is their duty to act in the interests of their constituents, and the people they represent need healthcare. \n\nLink: https:\/\/actionnetwork.org\/petitions\/support-hr6906-the-health-care-emergency-guarantee-act?source=direct_link&\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n#healthcareemergencyguaranteeact #medicareforall #covid19 #healthcareisahumanright #dsamedicareforall #charlestondsa #democraticsocialistsofamerica #hr6906 #wearamask #healthcareforall #publicsafety #pandemic2020 #healthcare #healthjustice","NumberOfLikes":16,"Hashtags":["#healthcareemergencyguaranteeact","#medicareforall","#covid19","#healthcareisahumanright","#dsamedicareforall","#charlestondsa","#democraticsocialistsofamerica","#hr6906","#wearamask","#healthcareforall","#publicsafety","#pandemic2020","#healthcare","#healthjustice"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Charleston DSA on August 08, 2020.

This was my wedding and I\u2019m a covid bride. I didn\u2019t see it happening like this but the most important thing... is finding the right person. I love @gongfuman with all of my heart and I am proud to be his wife. \n\nWe got married Monday, July 13th, 2020. I\u2019m posting this late because I\u2019m still learning to come to terms with what this all looked like. We didn\u2019t know we were getting married on this day. We were supposed to get our marriage license but in the car ride down to Laguna Hills Governor Newsom announced the second shut down of all non-essential businesses. \n\nAfter an hour of driving, we arrived and they said they\u2019ll be closing their offices and won\u2019t know when they\u2019ll open again. So... in our t-shirts, my unbrushed ponytail, and Lulu\u2019s... we got married. \n\nWith plexi glass between the county clerk and us, we were pronounced husband and wife and kissed with masks on. We used sanitizer before and afterwards. \n\nOur beautiful wedding rings, his gorgeous blue tailored suit and my wedding dress will be stored away until the pandemic is over and we can have a ceremony and celebration. \n\nWe are lucky to be alive during this challenging time and I would hate to risk having a party with all of my closest friends and family. \n\nSo... here\u2019s a piece of our story. Hopefully this sheds some light on anyone planning or thinking about a wedding during a pandemic. \n\nIn many ways, stripping everything away from what is \u201Csupposed\u201D to be a wedding made it even more special, raw.... and human. Special thanks to Landon Tom, Adam\u2019s childhood best friend for racing over last minute to be our witness. 👰🏼🤵🏼💍 🎂❤️✨ \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#covidwedding #myweddingstory #covidbride #husbandandwife #wedding #mylove❤️ #covid19 #pandemiclife #pandemic2020 #pandemicwedding #thelawsons","NumberOfLikes":204,"Hashtags":["#covidwedding","#myweddingstory","#covidbride","#husbandandwife","#wedding","#mylove❤️","#covid19","#pandemiclife","#pandemic2020","#pandemicwedding","#thelawsons"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Catherine Keithley Lawson in Laguna Hills Civic Center with @gongfuman.

My last place ticked a lot of boxes. It fulfilled many of my wants, the main one being that I had my own place. So much growth and change happened within those walls, and from it, the greatest gift I attribute to my experience living alone - a return to myself and reminder of who I am. Something that can only be found when you are alone. I thank my time within that space for the opportunity to get deeply acquainted and centered in my aloneness. What a blessing it is to come to know yourself, to look inside yourself.\n.\nIt is from knowing myself and seeing aloneness as my nature (not to be mistaken for loneliness) that I have been able to remain at home and at ease throughout the pandemic. Not just at home in the physical sense, but home with myself.\n.\nIt just so happens that my former home was a 5 house, which in numerology represents a year of freedom and major change in one\u2019s life, particularly in the areas of career, family and residence. How relevant that my new home is a 6 house which deals with family, health (personal as well as family members), responsibility and service. Six represents the peace and harmony that returns when the disruption and instability seen in the five is resolved. It is a new equilibrium that brings balance and cooperation. \n.\nAll this is happening right on time for today, 8\/8, also known as Lions Gate. What this means for me - a time to integrate this cosmic energy into my heart (as brought on by the 6), and to release old ways and thoughts that no longer serve me (in moving on from the 5). I trust that spirit is guiding me as I surrender to the natural flow of the universe who always has my back.","NumberOfLikes":84,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by colleen on August 08, 2020.

At this time when it seems that there is little good news to take in, my chat with James was inspirational. James told me that when he is not working he feeds the homeless in Clayton County, his community. He uses his personal funds to create 100 lunch bags a week to distribute to people in need. He said others have criticized him for using his hard-earned money to feed \u201Cpeople who choose not to help themselves,\u201D but his reply is, \u201CWhat\u2019s the use of helping people when they are doing well.

The Chinese know how to scare the West. Everything will be all right, trust me. I survived there. Moreover, I grew up in Vladivostok, right on the border with North Korea. Kim Jong-un's rockets are another regular joke for me. You can't scare me so easily. And I seem to have luck.\n\nEarly March 2020. I am in Moscow on a research trip.

The government would use the extra spending, worth 25 billion euros (23 billion pounds), to soften the blow to an economy ravaged by lockdown measures imposed to stem the COVID-19 pandemic, which has killed almost 35,200 people. Italy hopes to front-load this year part of 209 billion euros in grants and cheap loans it should receive from the Recovery Fund starting in 2021. The Italian economy has been among the worst hit by the crisis, facing an 11.2% contraction this year, according to European Union estimates, the sharpest fall in the 27-nation bloc. \u201CWe have set aside 12 billion euros to support employment,\u201D Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told reporters after a three-hour Cabinet meeting. Part of the borrowing will be used to conditionally extend temporary layoff schemes for up to 18 weeks, with firms required not to cut jobs to qualify for state aid. Companies less affected by the crisis will have to pay a contribution to apply for aid covering a period which exceeds the first nine weeks, a draft decree seen by Reuters showed.\n.\n.\nDo follow and share @the_recent.column for latest updates.\n.\n.\n#italy_stop #italianfood #italygram #instaitaly #italy #italytrip #recentcolumn #therecentcolumn #worldgram #romania #romantic #rome #romeitaly #rome🇮🇹 #europeanunion #europeanstyle #europe #european #pandemic2020 #stimuluspackage #businessinvestment #businessleadership #travelling #tourism #businessupdates #instanewsdaily #infographic #infogram #infographic #youtube #youtubevideos","NumberOfLikes":15,"Hashtags":["#italy_stop","#italianfood","#italygram","#instaitaly","#italy","#italytrip","#recentcolumn","#therecentcolumn","#worldgram","#romania","#romantic","#rome","#romeitaly","#rome🇮🇹","#europeanunion","#europeanstyle","#europe","#european","#pandemic2020","#stimuluspackage","#businessinvestment","#businessleadership","#travelling","#tourism","#businessupdates","#instanewsdaily","#infographic","#infogram","#infographic","#youtube","#youtubevideos"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The_Recent.Column on August 08, 2020.

Mas trouxe-nos também aprendizados importantes e tudo aquilo que devemos retirar disso: somos o Ser mais forte, mais inteligente e mais resiliente. Somos o Ser que se readapta e vai buscar o melhor nas piores circunstâncias. A pandemia mostrou-nos que viver em pleno sec. XXI, em plena Era de novas tecnologias, foi a grande mais-valia: sim, é possível estudar e trabalhar com um ecrã, com comunicação por vídeo-conferência. Se antes apenas fazíamos uma vídeo-chamada esporadicamente com a família mais longínqua ou uma reunião por videoconferência quando era a ultima opção, desta vez essa mesma vídeo-conferência permitiu que a adversidade não fosse pior; que muitos mais postos de trabalho não se perdessem. Enfim, podia ter sido pior? Podia! O Online ajudou-nos? Ajudou! Mas sem o Presencial não era a mesma coisa. Aprendemos que em poucos dias nos podemos tornar Masters das vídeo-conferências mas as mesmas  não substituem um sorriso ao vivo; não substituem um abraço; não substituem o calor humano. Trabalhar com crianças é contacto, é amor, é carinho... Nenhuma máquina vai substituir o professor presencialmente. As recordações ficam.

A time to focus on social injustices and educate yourself.\n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong- I have my moments of anger and loneliness- lots of them. I miss my parents and my brother like crazy and I\u2019m incredibly frustrated about distance learning and what it will mean for working parents.  BUT- this gives me an opportunity to slow down. Breathe. Re-evaluate. It gives me a chance to reflect on the intention of starting my own practice- to have flexibility and spend more time with my children.\n\nAnd just like that a flip in perspective- my private practice goals are being fulfilled in this pandemic. I GET to spend more time with my kids and I GET to exercise that flexibility in my small business. Maybe this year I won\u2019t crush it at work, but I can aim to crush it at home because of the life I\u2019ve designed.\n\nTry it. Try changing your perspective. Maybe you didn\u2019t have time to work on your branding and website before. Maybe working out was difficult to fit into your schedule. Or cooking. Maybe you have been wanting to read more or catch up on a great tv show. Maybe you\u2019ve been needing a reason to become more politically active.

Approximately 80% of those with COVID-19 end up having a mild response and most of those cases resolve in about two weeks. For people who have a severe response to the virus, it can take between three and six weeks to recover.\n\nBUT NOW, there is growing concern over a separate group who don\u2019t seem to fall into either of those categories. A number of people are now reporting lingering #symptoms of the illness for one, two or even three months. This new group is mixed with those who experienced both mild and severe cases. As health experts step in to try to manage these patients and learn more, many are referring to this group as coronavirus \u201Clong-haulers\u201D or \u201Clong-termers.\u201D\n\n\u201CWe\u2019re now seeing a percentage of patients whose symptoms seem to be lasting a while,\u201D explains family medicine provider Christopher Babiuch, MD. \u201CThis is challenging because everyone\u2019s needs are so unique. We\u2019re finding that collaborating as a team between different specialists helps to manage and support these patients, but there\u2019s a lot that we just don\u2019t know yet.\u201D - health.clevelandclinic.org #iahsay \n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n#selflessness #Millennial\u2019s #CommunityOriented #Selfless #Humankind #HumanKindness #Thoughtful #Community #WearAMask #Mask #AMaskIsNotAPoliticalStatement #HealthcareWorkers #HealthcareHeroes #Pandemic2020 #Quarantine2020 #SocialDistancing #Longterm #Longhaul #NeurologicalIssues #Braindamaged #LungDamage #CognitiveFunction #fridayforfuture","NumberOfLikes":94,"Hashtags":["#sideeffects","#aftereffects","#COVID19","#Coronavirus","#symptoms","#iahsay","#selflessness","#Millennial\u2019s","#CommunityOriented","#Selfless","#Humankind","#HumanKindness","#Thoughtful","#Community","#WearAMask","#Mask","#AMaskIsNotAPoliticalStatement","#HealthcareWorkers","#HealthcareHeroes","#Pandemic2020","#Quarantine2020","#SocialDistancing","#Longterm","#Longhaul","#NeurologicalIssues","#Braindamaged","#LungDamage","#CognitiveFunction","#fridayforfuture"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by i am human | so are you in Planet Earth.

The women were always so busy, there was little time to exchange pleasantries and not much interaction on their part. \n\nBut when I strolled past nobody was buying. Seconds after I took this shot I watched as a small group of Chinese tourists approached the flower stalls. Each vendor quickly picked up a bunch of flowers and went and stood at the front of her stall, and, all smiles and in the sweetest of voices, called out \u201CBuy from me, buy from me!\u201D \n\nFortunately the guide \u2014 and guides don\u2019t usually get involved in these transactions \u2014 encouraged the tourists to buy flowers from each stall. The vendors were very happy. Tough times for everyone here right now. \n\nAnd that\u2019s the third small group of Chinese tourists I\u2019ve seen in recent weeks. Good to see small groups are starting to trend.

The once frost bitten trees following winter flourish into evergreen, the flowers bud. \n\nMeditating on the life-cycle of nature reassures me that we too will blossom once more - that once again we will grow green and lush, stand tall and proud like the great oak tree. We will sing like the birds at dawn. We will be anew. \n\nThese times we are living now are scary, they fill us with fear and dread. \nThey have stripped us bare like nature in winter, when the harsh frosts blight the leaves and flowers and the landscape is as a deaden wasteland.\n\nHowever, despite the acrid weather, the biting frosts that decimate the blooms - spring always comes. \nMay we never forget this, may we dwell not upon what is, but delight in what will be. May we be strong, stand tall and unite.  May we rebuild what the winter has broken and flourish once again. \n#poetry #poetrycommunity #poetsofinstagram #poemoftheday #nature #flourish #spring #pandemic2020 #poetrylovers #instagrampoet","NumberOfLikes":3,"Hashtags":["#poetry","#poetrycommunity","#poetsofinstagram","#poemoftheday","#nature","#flourish","#spring","#pandemic2020","#poetrylovers","#instagrampoet"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Emily Bird on August 07, 2020.

It was one of my hobbies. Remember those?\n\u2014\nFor the first time since I became pregnant with my first, I\u2019ve started painting again. I had it in my mind that I would once I had gotten through the baby phase. I just had no idea the baby phase would last so long... My youngest is almost 3, and I\u2019m just now at the point I can explore hobbies again - 5 years later.\n\u2014\nMatrescence is a beautiful word to describe a person\u2019s emotional, mental and physical transition to motherhood. Before children, I had imagined matrescence to evolve over a few months. I realize now it\u2019s a much longer process, and it reappears anytime another child is added to the family. I think it\u2019s helpful to look at the transition into motherhood similar to the way we look at the transition into adulthood. It\u2019s slowly evolving and changing, and it takes years to develop this part of our identity. The more I viewed it as a long journey, the more comfortable I felt being in the thick of an unexpected evolution of myself. I tend to judge myself - my actions, thoughts and emotions - with a critical eye. The more I looked at my thoughts and emotions with curiosity, and less with judgement, the more settled I felt in the transition.\n\u2014\nDoes anyone else feel like a similar process has happened with this pandemic? Maybe if we stop holding our breath waiting for it to be over, we can endure this chaos with more ease. Maybe we can even enjoy it.🤔","NumberOfLikes":56,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Kristin Yeung Lasseter, MD in Austin, Texas.","NumberOfComments":19,"Timestamp":1596800392,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 07 13:39:52 CEST 2020","Location":"Austin, Texas"},{"Owner":"adzcarterofficial","CaptionText":"Yep, it's certainly been an interesting year across the globe so far...\n-\n-\n#2020 #2020memes #memes #coronavirus #corona #covid #covid19 #covid19outbreak #covid2019 #covid_19 #pandemic #pandemic2020 #panic #fear #thanos #thanosmemes #graphs #stanleykubrick #clockworkorange #theshining #fullmetaljacket #tigerking #raceriots #independenceday #egypt #ironman #johnwick #president #xijinping #thejoker","NumberOfLikes":3,"Hashtags":["#2020","#2020memes","#memes","#coronavirus","#corona","#covid","#covid19","#covid19outbreak","#covid2019","#covid_19","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#panic","#fear","#thanos","#thanosmemes","#graphs","#stanleykubrick","#clockworkorange","#theshining","#fullmetaljacket","#tigerking","#raceriots","#independenceday","#egypt","#ironman","#johnwick","#president","#xijinping","#thejoker"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1596800382,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 07 13:39:42 CEST 2020","Location":"Planet Earth"},{"Owner":"indian_plates_","CaptionText":"#nankhatai #cookies #cookieartist \n#nankhataibiscuit \n#butterbuttons #instadaily #picoftheday📷 \n#buttercookies #cookies #nagpuritadka #nagpuri \n#nagpur #cookiesofinstagram #cookies🍪 #cookievideos #bangalorefoodies \n#bangalore \n#pune #punefoodie #baking #baker #pandemiclife #pandemic #pandemic2020 #pandemiccooking #easyrecipe #yummyfood #simplecooking \n#butterbiscuits \n#chefsofinstagram \n#chefalvirasheikh \n@ranveer.brar @khanakhazana_1 \n@sanjeevkapoor \n@bakersofnagpur @zingyzest \n@thehungryclones @girly_n_gluttony \n@parthbajaj @thetongueandscissors \n@nagpureats_official @nkagpur_buzz \n@nagpuri_khana_official \n@nagpuri__damaka \n@nagpuritadka @desi_guttler @hellopune_ \n@mumbaifoodie \n\n.\nHome sweet home","NumberOfLikes":9,"Hashtags":["#nankhatai","#cookies","#cookieartist","#nankhataibiscuit","#butterbuttons","#instadaily","#picoftheday📷","#buttercookies","#cookies","#nagpuritadka","#nagpuri","#nagpur","#cookiesofinstagram","#cookies🍪","#cookievideos","#bangalorefoodies","#bangalore","#pune","#punefoodie","#baking","#baker","#pandemiclife","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#pandemiccooking","#easyrecipe","#yummyfood","#simplecooking","#butterbiscuits","#chefsofinstagram","#chefalvirasheikh"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1596800375,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 07 13:39:35 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"dvine_design","CaptionText":"We certainly didn\u2019t see ourselves selling face mask and hand sanitizing products.

What a novel idea 💡 huh? They said they wanted the following classes: PE, Gardening, Nature, Water, \u201CWhekanee and Hoo Hoo class\u201D (Jessa\u2019s suggestion), Jewelry, Art, Pottery, \u201CTo learn about different kinds of rocks,\u201D (Jessa). They came up with an awesome list of subjects they want to learn about. I said, \u201CWhat about math?\u201D and they all cringed haha. I told them I\u2019m required to teach them math, science, Lang Arts, social studies. They said what about computers? I cringed... and said ok that\u2019s a good suggestion I might carve out some time and let you get on a computer for a little bit.  I\u2019ve been resisting the online learning option because I tell my kids, \u201CI gave birth to human babies, not robots!\u201D I\u2019m not gonna be enticed by free chrome books... they\u2019re like what\u2019s enticed mean? \u201CIt\u2019s like giving a kid a candy so they can come with you and be taken away.\u201D I told them they mean more to me than free electronics and I want their brain to develop like regular kids and in Nature. And I love how their interests in learning involve real world hands on activities. I can\u2019t wait to teach them about Water and self healing, about prayer in our own language... so many opportunities to build in Nature as science. And of course I already had them learn about epidemiology over the summer and had them graph our community COVID19 data...
