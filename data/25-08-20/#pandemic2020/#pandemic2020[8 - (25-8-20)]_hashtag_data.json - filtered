Pandangan ini tidak mempertentangkan antara kaum perempuan dan laki-laki, karena keduanya harus bekerjasama dalam kemitraan dan keharmonisan dalam kehidupan keluarga, masyarakat, bangsa dan negara.\n\nDari pandangan beberapa orang, suami yang bekerja dan istri yang mengurus anak-anaknya di rumah merupakan hal yang biasa saja. Namun, orang juga bisa berpendapat bahwa gambaran tersebut melambangkan opresi terhadap perempuan. Pandangan bahwa perempuan \u201Cseharusnya\u201D tinggal dirumah dan mengurus anak bisa dianggap sebagai upaya laki-laki untuk membatasi potensi perempuan. Dan disaat pandemi sekarang yang paling terkena dampak pandemi tentunya seorang suami yang biasa bekerja akhirnya terhambat dan bahkan tidak bisa bekerja lagi.\n\nDalam kondisi itulah, peran istri yang biasa dirumah selalu menjaga pola makanan sehat agar daya tahan tubuh keluarga menjadi tetap stabil, serta ikut berperan juga dalam hal ekonomi dengan potensi yang selama ini terbatasi, peran suami sebagai kepala keluarga yang membantu istrinya di waktu luang serta tetap menjaga dan melindungi interaksi sosial dalam keluarganya, hingga peran anak yang tetap dirumah untuk membantu orang tuanya dan fokus untuk belajar online, serta tidak sering bepergian agar tidak menimbulkan hal yang tidak diinginkan terjadi. Selain itu anggota keluarga juga bisa saling mengingatkan agar tidak keluar rumah, menjaga kebersihan, selalu mengonsumsi makanan sehat, serta mengingatkan anggota keluarganya agar tetap tenang dan tidak panik dalam menghadapi pandemi Covid-19. \n\n\"Apapun kekuatannya kerjasama yang dibangun tanpa membedakan peran biologis dan peran kultural dalam keluarga dapat mewujudkan keluarga dan lingkungan yang harmonis\"\n\nInstitut Teknologi Telkom Purwokerto @ittelkom_purwokerto\nArTim: \nM.

If you\u2019re not being heard or seen online, chances are you\u2019re not getting the kind of traction you want or making the kind of sales you want especially now. 2020 has not been the year we had planned for. \n:\nPart of the reason is that as of April of this year, there were approximately 4,570,000,000 billion Internet users online. WOW Right?\n:\nThat is approximately 319,900,000 million more people than last year. And many of those people are starting online businesses. So, it is not a figment of your imagination. The online space is getting more crowded. But there is a secret weapon. \n:\nIf you want to learn how to stand out online and make money so you don\u2019t have to hustle and grind you\u2019re invited to a FREE 5-day 🔥🔥🔥 INSTAGRAM TRAINING SERIES 🔥🔥🔥. It is unlike anything you have ever experienced. \n:\nThis training series has helped brand new beginners to influencers literally grow their accounts from a few hundred to 50k, 100k, 150k, and some to over a million followers. There is no one teaching Instagram growth this way. \n:\nTo stand out online now and to make money requires a different approach especially with everything happening in the world. What worked before 2020 is not working the same way right now.\n:\nUnprecedented times call for unprecedented measures. There is no better time to grow your business and to #magnifyyourmessagenow \n:\nDM the word \u201CGROWTH\u201D and I\u2019d be happy to send you the FULL details. Or drop an ❤️ in the comments. But you don\u2019t want to miss this.","NumberOfLikes":4,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Message | Mission | Movement on August 06, 2020.

Jovens adultos, cansados do isolamento social e com dificuldades econômicas, têm abandonado a quarentena ou se mostrado mais descuidados em lugares que passam pela reabertura das atividades, contribuindo assim para fazer com que casos de covid-19 voltem a crescer em lugares onde a doença havia arrefecido.\n\n\u201CPessoas jovens podem se infectar, pessoas jovens podem morrer; e pessoas jovens podem transmitir o vírus a outros\u201D, declarou o chefe da OMS. Em seu discurso, Ghebreyesus disse que convencer os jovens desses riscos é um dos desafios da organização atualmente uma vez que persiste a noção de que a covid-19 é uma doença que só atinge pessoas mais velhas.\n\nDe acordo com um levantamento da Bloomberg com dados oficiais do fim de julho, em países como Japão, Austrália e Coreia do Sul, as pessoas entre 20 e 39 anos são os maiores grupos no total de infectados. Na capital japonesa, Tóquio, 52% das pessoas diagnosticadas com covid-19 está nesse recorte de idade.\n\nLink na bio.\nFonte: Nexo Jornal\n#covid19 #coronavirus #ONN #onovonormal #ONNpoliticapublica #covidart #covid2020, #covid19brasil #covidmask #covidphotodiaries #covidnews #covid19art #corona #coronavírus #coronavirusbrazil #coronaviruspandemic #coronavirusoutbreak #coronavirus2020 #pandemic #pandemicart #pandemic2020, #pandemicorona #pandemiclife #trabalhandoemcasa #emcasa #centenialls #millenial #jovens","NumberOfLikes":20,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by O Novo Normal in São Paulo, Brazil.

Antes do coronavírus, ser jovem \u201Cera pensar que você tinha a vida inteira pela frente\u201D, diz. \n\nHá poucos meses, ele sentia que podia tomar dois anos sabáticos e recuperá-los em seguida. Mas a covid-19 mudou completamente sua percepção do tempo. A vida se deteve, e o futuro foi tragado pela incerteza. \n\nAgora que o demitiram \u201Cda noite para o dia\u201D do trabalho que tinha como estagiário no jornal Correo \u2014como parte das demissões em massa realizadas por diversos meios de comunicação nos últimos meses, entre eles o grupo El Comercio do Peru\u2014, pensar nos dias que virão significa repensar quem deseja ser e como quer viver.\n\nA pandemia deu uma pausa na rotina de milhões de jovens no mundo. Levou-os a reconsiderar suas prioridades, suas formas de vida, seus objetivos. Eles deixaram de imaginar um futuro inclusivo e cheio de oportunidades para se reinventar num presente intimidante. \n\nNinguém sabe qual será o custo real da crise provocada pela paralisação da covid-19, mas as previsões indicam que os jovens de 18 a 25 anos ficarão com a pior parte. E a América Latina será uma das regiões que pagarão mais caro. \n\nAnte a perspectiva de um futuro embargado, a Geração Z no continente se aferra à ideia de construir uma nova normalidade mais consciente sobre questões como a mudança climática, a desigualdade social e o movimento feminista. \n\nLink na bio.\n\nFonte: El País\n\n#covid19 #coronavirus #ONN #onovonormal #ONNpoliticapublica #covidart #covid2020, #covid19brasil #covidmask #covidphotodiaries #covidnews #covid19art #corona #coronavírus #coronavirusbrazil #coronaviruspandemic #coronavirusoutbreak #coronavirus2020 #pandemic #pandemicart #pandemic2020, #pandemicorona #pandemiclife #fiqueemcasa #futuro #emcasa #geracaoz #centenialls #millenialls","NumberOfLikes":3,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by 🌟🌟🌟Brasilia⭐️Brazil🌟🌟🌟 on August 06, 2020.

I feel grateful that my appointments are just exploratory testing and not more serious. I read a post the other day about a mother that received news of her miscarriage alone, and then had to go out to the car to tell her husband. It breaks my heart for them. Especially since we, as a military family, often have to experience things alone, but to have to do so when your loved one is on the other side of the wall from you just seems absurd. \n\nI had an ultrasound today. The ultrasound was to look for any physical blockages or issues that might be inhibiting a healthy pregnancy. It was all clear. Which is good news, I guess, but also means no answers and on to the next test. \n\nThey did do bloodwork at my last appointment and we discussed it today. My estrogen levels are high. Not unhealthy high, but higher than the average and 3x the amount at which they consider an issue with becoming pregnant. Again, good news for trying to get pregnant, but also interesting to learn considering how miserable I am off of birth control. It explains why I am so much more emotional, experience weight gain, and have such terrible PMS symptoms every cycle. I guess it\u2019s a relief to at least have some answers about that. \n\nMy next appointment hasn\u2019t been scheduled yet, but we\u2019re hoping to accomplish that test in the next month or so. I\u2019ll update then on whatever progress we\u2019ve made. \n\nP.S. masks made by @masker_aid_usa 😷 (You can shop this style in different patterns on my website and I\u2019ll be making more this weekend, too!)\n\n#facemaskselfie #thenewnormal #pandemiclife #pandemic2020 #secondaryinfertility #obgyn #anotherdayanothertest #embracethejourney #beautifulasamother #kodiaktradingco","NumberOfLikes":30,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":8,"Timestamp":1596730624,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 06 18:17:04 CEST 2020","Location":"Fort Lee, Virginia"},{"CaptionText":"Welcome a new homeowner to Southborough!  #southboroughma #movewithgary #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":15,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1596730569,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 06 18:16:09 CEST 2020","Location":"Move With Gary"},{"CaptionText":"This man gets it!!!! @iansmithfitness never stand down! #lionsnotsheep #lockdowns #covid #newjerseygym #coronavirusmemes","NumberOfLikes":4,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Doctor Discourse on August 06, 2020 tagging @iansmithfitness.

A refund on my last few months of pregnancy and a refund on my first 3 months as a mum. \n\n#feelinglikeafailure \n\nAre you a first time mum like me? This is a cute, difficult, much needed reminder that WE GOT THIS! I always knew motherhood would be difficult. Throw in a pandemic and we didn't stand a chance.\n\nThe pandemic really altered our first few months as mums didn't it? It definitely did with me. Although yes I've had super uninterrupted time with my baby - I was really looking forward to doing all the new mum things. Like baby sensory classes, meeting other new mums, babies making friends that could be for life. But instead we've stayed at home most of his precious life. Instead of getting ready to take him to a baby group or swimming, or a simple meet up with a fellow new mum (with cuddles allowed!) Here i am sat watching as he has his morning nap, thinking I've failed him again. Of all times to have a baby I've chosen the same month a worldwide pandemic disabled the world! Obviously I know no one could have predicted this but it doesn't help sometimes when I'm feeling shitty and lost, wondering if I'm doing this right? I mean how often do new mums NOT get seen by a midwife or health visitor after one VIDEO CALL on day 5? *eye roll*\n\nNo help from anyone, no support and definitely no break! \n\nBut let's look on the bright side... \n\nOne positive (ish) thing about lockdown however - when baby asks me why he didn't meet my parents, his grandparents,  I'll just tell him it was because of lockdown and shielding. I wont tell him the real reason. I wont tell him that when I needed support, all they did was judge me.\n\n#cardib #coronavirus #maternityleave #pregnancy #cardibfans","NumberOfLikes":7,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by D is for diary on August 06, 2020.

Firstly I realise that many people are posting well wishes for the new yearly intake. You are about to begin what is hopefully a lifelong journey, it\u2019s a marathon not a sprint and think about the choices and opportunities that lie ahead of you even if you hit a bump in the road.\n\n🌻You will meet many colleagues and patients from all walks of life, cultures, faiths and backgrounds - keep your mind open to understanding the need of the individual and leave unconscious bias at the door. \n\n🌻Read the Marmot review 2010 & 2020 to understand how social-political factors impact peoples health outcomes and in fact their life expectancy. The root causes that perpetuate health and social inequality are explained and we can all reflect upon the way the healthcare system and as doctors we could feed into the disparities. The austerity impact of covid is likely to affect the delivery of many services, from early start schemes to education aswell as healthcare, so our handling and the understanding of our patients lives and how their health needs and behaviours have changed is crucial to know.\n\n🌻You are entering medicine at a time like no other in the midst of a pandemic. The work environment, even perhaps your outlook on life may change. It certainly has changed mine. Self-care is more than a cliche banded around - speak to your seniors and team around you, stick together and look out for one another. You have a whole MDT around you who you can gain experience from too.\n\n🌻 Resilience is not about having impeccable endurance; it is knowing when to pause for self-preservation and above all stay safe as you help others and remember those who love and care for you the most who have rooted for you since day one.❤️","NumberOfLikes":219,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Dr Lara Hutchins MBCHB, MRCGP on August 05, 2020.

Pick a couple very ripe tomatoes from your garden.\n2. Put on a tank top or bathing suit, accent with flip flops.\n3. Slice the tomatoes and layer them with Miracle Whip, or Hellman's mayonaise depending on your geography.\n4. Salt and pepper to taste.\n5. If you want to be fancy add lettuce.\n6. Place between preferably Wonder Bread or Sunbeam bread slices depending on your geography (I used naan cause it was in the house.)\n7. Smash together and eat while standing over the sink where you have placed a sponge and towel.\n8. Rinse off using the spray attachment- face, hands, arms up to the elbows.\nA very good meal to enjoy in solitude in the privacy of your own kitchen.\n\n#pandemiccooking #covidcooking #covidrecipes #pandemiclife #pandemic2020 #whitetrashcookbook #kitchensinksandwich","NumberOfLikes":23,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Lisa G.

This prevents taking it on and off or losing it)\n\u2022 Sanitizer often & before re entering  the vehicle \n\u2022 Allow a toy that is easily sanitized once home again. (This is key to keeping kids hands distracted from touching their face, Playing with their mask or touching anything in public) \n\u2022 Keep a blanket in the vehicle for impromptu picnics to avoid eating at restaurants\/patios \n\u2022 Atraining potty & wipes is also handy for longer outings to avoid the use of public restrooms. \n\u2022 Change clothes upon returning home and bath asap \n\nIF YOU HAVE A TIP PLEASE SHARE IN THE COMMENTS BELOW ⏬😃⏬\n\n#parentingtips #parenting #pandemic #pandemic2020 #safetyfirst #wearamask #quarantinediaries #parenthood #parenthoodunplugged #mumof3 #parentinginapandemic #momlife #momswithcameras #picnic #socialdistancing #summertime #summer2020 #summer #scooter #scooterlife #staysafe #staysafeeveryone","NumberOfLikes":19,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1596661560,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 05 23:06:00 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"It would be easy to be scared during this pandemic.\nThere is so much out of our control but here are a few things we are doing in our family to keep our immunity up!\n\u2022Eat Whole Foods!

School is now in session. Today's story is about an unrecognized black hero named Henrietta Lacks. Her immortal life would save countless lives and change scientific research forever. \u2063\n\u2063\nHenrietta, 31, married mother of 5 was born in the 1920's. She suffered from cervical cancer.\u2063 \u2063\nDuring a visit to the John Hopkins Center for treatment, her body was looted. Her cervical cells stolen and used for research without her consent. Later these mind blowing cells called HeLa cells would become the first human biological material to be bought and sold world wide. This discovery  launched a multi-billion-dollar industry all of which Henrietta and her family would never be compensated for.\u2063\n\u2063\nPrior to her cells being harvested, cells studied outside of the human body would die after only a few cellular divisions. This made it nearly impossible for any substantial research to be conducted. However, Henrietta's miraculous cells divided endlessly therefore becoming immortal. \u2063\n\u2063\nBefore HeLa cells a woman would receive a hysterectomy for something as simple as a bacterial infection. Now let that sink in. \u2063\n\u2063\nSome 70,000 studies have been published involving the use of HeLa cells and they are in widespread use throughout the field of immunology. At least two Nobel Prizes have been awarded recently for research involving HeLa cells, one on the link between human papilloma virus and cervical cancer (2008 by Harald zur Hausen), which was shared with the discoverers of HIV (Luc Montagnier and Francoise Barre-Sinoussi), and the other into the part played by the telomerase enzyme in preventing chromosome degradation (2009 by Elizabeth Blackburn, Carol Greider and Jack Szostak).\u2063\n\u2063\nSource: British Science for Immunology. \u2063\n\u2063\nA few notable scientific breakthroughs as a result of the HeLa cell:\u2063\n\u2063\n1.) Cancer research.\u2063\n2.) Polio cure.\u2063\n3.) Gene mapping.\u2063\n4.) Chromosome counting.\u2063\n5.) Created the field of virology. \u2063\n6.)

If your company is still there, and there are no major pay cuts or layoffs, please treat your company well. Because they are carrying all the tests that you can't see. And humans are facing the pandemic that cannot be controlled. The second half of 2020, is the challenge of corporate strength. I remember Robert Kiyosaki said that he prefers to invest in smaller businesses because whenever crisis happens, the first to collapse will be those big companies and brands. 2020 is about survival but those who can exploit it, will manage to achieve unparalleled heights this year too!

If your business ain't running well manage to survive dont think to make impractical $1M.\nBe happy with what you have as 2020 is about SURVIVAL!\n#pandemiceffects #business #victoriassecret #zara #bankruptcy #brandscollapse #debt #starbucksclosed #chanel #goldsgym #failure #pandemic2020 #business #rolex #jobless #paycut #thankful #mycompany #effectsofcrisis #effortsgonewasted #effortswasted","NumberOfLikes":53,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1596619434,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 05 11:23:54 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Adidas Neo Baseline Black List White \n\n100% Original Authentic \n(Garansi uang kembali apabila tidak Original)\n\n100% Trusted (Est. 2019)\n(Bukan Sepatu KW, PREMIUM, dan Sejenisnya) \n\n-Brand New In Box-\nMade In Indonesia\nSepatu Lengkap Beserta BOX (Free Sticker EL&CAS)\n\nArtikel : B74445\n(Tulis Artikel di Mesin Pencarian, Google dll.)\n\nTersedia Size :\n\n39 1\/3 (24.5 Cm) = 1\n40 2\/3 (25.5 Cm) = 2\n42 2\/3 (27 Cm) = 1\n\nPrice : Rp. 350.000\n\n*Produk baru seperti di gambar.\n*Stok di deskripsi sudah pasti tersedia.\n*Stock kami terbatas dan tidak stock kembali (Checkout sebelum kehabisan).\n*(Fast Response).\n\nNOTE : Garansi tidak berlaku apabila tidak disertai Video Unboxing\n\n#adidassolarboost #casual #futsalsport #sneakers #sneakersindo #sneakersmurah #jakarta #jualanonline #sneakersjakarta #adidassambarose #adidasultraboost #adidasgazelle #adidassolardrive #adidascampus #adidasp.o.d #adidasyoungchasm96 #adidasquestion #adidasshoes #adidasgoletto #adidasfutsalsale #adidasmurah #murah #futsal #pandemic2020 #adidas #pandemic #covid19 #liputan6 #jakartasneakersday","NumberOfLikes":0,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1596619381,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 05 11:23:01 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"These are not scenes from a movie this is L E B A N O N a country that\u2019s already suffering from corruption, civil strife, a pandemic and refugee crisis to name a few.

As lockdown eases we continue to need donations of food and money to allow the charities to continue with their vital work.\"\n\nMargaret, like almost everyone, misses being able to see her family, especially her baby grandson, and is looking forward to meeting up with them all again soon.\n\n#inkingston #portrait #london #photography  #portraitphotography #socialdocumentary #documentaryphotography #femalephotographer #cameramama #coronavirus #thelifestylecollective #londonphotographer #naturallightportrait #surreymums #pandemic2020 #supportsmallcharities #surrey #naturallightphotographer #kingstonuponthames #mayor #femalemayor #pandemicportraits #nurse #documentaryphotography @newjournalistmagazine #massisolationformat #wearedistanttogether #councillor #phlocklive #discoverunder1k","NumberOfLikes":23,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1596610060,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 05 08:47:40 CEST 2020","Location":"Kingston upon Thames"},{"CaptionText":"Converse CT 70s Low OX White\n\n100% Original Authentic \n(Garansi uang kembali apabila tidak Original)\n\n100% Trusted (Est. 2019)\n(Bukan Sepatu KW, PREMIUM, dan Sejenisnya) \n\n-Brand New In Box-\nMade In Vietnam\nSepatu Lengkap Beserta BOX (Free Sticker EL&CAS)\n\nArtikel : 162055C\n(Tulis Artikel di Mesin Pencarian, Google dll.)\n\nTersedia Size :\n\n44 (28.5 Cm) = 1\n\nSpecial Price : Rp. 400.000\n\n*Produk baru seperti di gambar.\n*Stok di deskripsi sudah pasti tersedia.\n*Stock kami terbatas dan tidak stock kembali (Checkout sebelum kehabisan).\n*(Fast Response).\n\nNOTE : Garansi tidak berlaku apabila tidak disertai Video Unboxing\n\n#conversejackpurcell #casual #sneakers #sneakersindo #sneakersmurah #jakarta #jualanonline #sneakersjakarta #converse70s #conversex #converseallstar #conversequestion #converseshoes #conversectas #conversesale #conversemurah #murah #conversect #pandemic2020 #converse #pandemic #covid19 #liputan6 #jakartasneakersday","NumberOfLikes":0,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1596610028,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 05 08:47:08 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Can you save humanity? \n\nSave the world from a massive infection in this challenging boardgame! \n.\n.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n📩DM us for orders and inquiries.\n.\n🛵Accepting same day delivery via Grab\/Lalamove\n.\n#pandemic #pandemic2020 #virus #cardgames #cardgame #cardgameph #fungame #partygames #boardgame #boardgames #boardgameph #gamenight #boredinthehouse","NumberOfLikes":4,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Yellow Tag Manila on August 04, 2020.

I debated if there could be such a thing. How could positivity EVER be toxic?? It most certainly can be and we are probably all guilty of it. People typically mean well when doing it. But now that I'm aware I had to do a self check and need to apologize to some folk. \u2063\n\u2063\nIn a world of social media posts touting \"Good vibes only\" and \"No negative energy\" this has somehow become law. However this is an unrealisric approach to the legitimate negative emotions and mental health issues faced by ourselves and others on a daily basis. \u2063\n\u2063\nWe all know toxic individuals or people who are negative in the most positive and ideal situations. These people aren't good for us. These aren't the folks I'm talking about. Pretending like negative emotions and mental health issues dont exist outside of these individuals, especially now and judging yourself or others for it is not healthy. Negative emotions and mental health issues aren't vibes. They're a daily fact of life. Living and interacting with others will not always be rainbows and unicorns. The totality of anyone includes negative emotion. \u2063\n\u2063\nThe Black community has notoriously ignored mental health issues and have made it often a misunderstood, ridiculed, embarrassing, and shameful subject to discuss. Its not. There is nothing wrong with not being ok and it'll look different for everyone. \u2063\n\u2063\nDuring Covid-19 mental health issues and suicide rates have skyrocketed. Feelings of loneliness and isolation are pushing people to the brink. \u2063\n\u2063\nThe phrase \"This isn't about you and no one owes you shit\" couldn't be truer. Everyone is going through it, struggling to cope and trying to hold on as best they can. As a community we've got to stop taking people's responses to mental health issues or negative emotions personal. Grace, compassion, and mercy is overdue. \u2063\n\u2063\nBlack women have unfairly been denied their negative emotions and told to be strong to superhuman levels. This has resulted in an increase in health issues including cardiac disease and stroke. \n\nContinued on last slide.","NumberOfLikes":2,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1596473540,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 03 18:52:20 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Good afternoon family y'all ok?

That is #pandemic2020 in 16 words.\n.\nThis is a metaphor too: #isaias did a weird amount of damage in its rapidly weakening state: large trees down all over the neighborhood and a couple of transformer fires. Never underestimate.\n.\nYesterday I watched an unwell person stride down Court Street. They were moving fast, eating, preaching, tossing food in their wake. They were wearing a bright yellow tank top, short shorts and short black Uggs. I waited for the light to change and crossed perpendicularly behind them, went to some stores, bought some coveted dosinfectant wipes that were back in stock after a few weeks, and headed home.\n.\nBack at the corner of Court, I waited for the light to change, another evening at home ahead of me. Something hit me lightly on the shoulder, tossed at me, grazing, and I began to pay attention to my surroundings again.  I turned around.\n.\nThe person in the yellow tank top paused for a moment in their stride. For a second our eyes met. \"This is a poor neighborhood, not a rich neighborhood,\" they said. \"Go back to your rich neighborhood.\"\n.\nIt's not a poor neighborhood, and it is my neighborhood, and I am not rich. The only time I can remember feeling both so targeted and unaware is when I was pickpocketed in Moscow, almost nine years ago to the day. \n.\nBuffered in a mask and sunglasses, tired from a day of remote work, and self-congratulatory on the acquisition of seventy-five germicidal cloths, my guard was down. I was unprepared for the strangeness of the encounter, but really nothing more was required of me.\n.\nSome things pass through like a storm, and some things linger, demanding vigilance, and then the untangling of our prayers.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#hurricaneisaias #nycpandemic #pandemic #prayerflags #disinfectantwipes #coronavirus #coronagram #covid #covid19 #covid_19","NumberOfLikes":24,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Elizabeth Grove in Brooklyn Heights.","NumberOfComments":8,"Timestamp":1596590921,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 05 03:28:41 CEST 2020","Location":"Brooklyn Heights"},{"CaptionText":"Just waiting for my zoom meeting to start 🤪 #adogslufe #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":26,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Tisa Browne on August 04, 2020 tagging @maxbrowne_.

It's called the Mourner's Kaddish and religious law dictates that it must only be said in the presence of a minyan, meaning ten or more people. So what becomes of the mourner in a world that can no longer gather? This is the question that individuals of all different faiths are attempting to answer in the age of COVID-19.\n❤️\nAs the global community reckons with a moment of mass mourning, the malleability of our grieving systems is on full display. While social distancing guidelines have made the strict end of life rituals that are customary to many religions non-viable, faith leaders are working hard to support those grieving from afar. With Zoom funerals and service materials passed through metal gates, religious institutions are proving they are prepared to bend and flex in order to help with the hard goodbyes.

The fish was a little dry (and chewy) and the chicken wasn't as tender as we had hoped.\n.\nFor mains, as you can see from the photo, there was plenty to go around. The spices in the curries were well put together and the naan was delicious. The mains really did make up for a poorer start. The plates of rice were of a rather delicate portion in comparison to the significant sauce provided by the various curries. This however, really left us too full for a third course!\n.\nOverall, as a family we enjoyed the food at the local Indian, however were a little disappointed with the lack of social distancing with the tables and lengthy wait times between the starters and main course. Understandibly, this is a \"cosy restaurant\" however, we were just 30cm from adjacent customer tables. All members of staff did not exhibit any form of PPE when serving or handling food and payment was a little tricky as there seemed to be a large number of exchanges of cards\/bills\/machines unnessarily. There was also a discrepancy with the bill, as it seemed there were hidden \"add-ons\" and charges which were not made known on arrival\/ordering. There are a few areas we feel TAJ MAHAL could consider looking into, particularly admist the current pandemic in order to ease the safety of their customers, however still an adequately pleasent experience. \n.\n. \n#pandemic2020 #stayhome #foodielife #eatingout #foodiephied #dietstartsmonday #carbs #eatingin #indianfood #takeout #ubereats #curry #socialdistancing #foodiephiedlove #ForTheLoveOfFood #ketomeals #ketorecipes #ketoweightloss #ketobreakfast #process #protein #proteinshake #cupcakes #gymtime #workaholic #workout #fuelyourbody","NumberOfLikes":6,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by 𝙵𝚘𝚛 𝚃𝚑𝚎 𝙻𝚘𝚟𝚎 𝙾𝚏 𝙵𝚘𝚘𝚍 in Taj Mahal.

My sis is driving me down, which is pretty cool 😎 I had a heart-to-heart with her which came out of the blue (but really, we all know these things build up inside of us until it hits a crunch-point!) It feels much lighter inside when you open up to someone you trust. Also, we joked about worst case scenarios, which actually made me feel better! 😂 \n⠀\n\u2022Have you got any tips for prepping for an operation?

It\u2019s only to help those that find it difficult, but want to. K?⠀\n⠀\nThe point of this post is to help other trauma survivors, like myself, who have been mandated to wear masks and are looking for help on how to do so more comfortably. ⠀\n⠀\nMasks have triggered my traumas on many different fronts, from things being strapped around my head, to the heat breathing in it, to feeling like I am choking. In addition, when I don\u2019t wear them, the passive aggressive comments just loud enough so I can hear them and the combativeness directly to me has also done the same. So I started working with my counselor and also found info my local rape crisis center shared on ways I can become more comfortable with wearing them. Here are some that has worked for me: ⠀\n⠀\n😷 Starting at home. Wearing it around my house to become more comfortable and familiar with it while in a space that I felt safe in, a space that wasn\u2019t already triggering. ⠀\n⠀\n😷 Finding a print I loved\/my style. ⠀\n⠀\n😷Wearing a head band with buttons so it brought the mask off my ears and didn\u2019t feel like I was being strapped. ⠀\n⠀\n😷 Putting a scent of essential oil in my mask that I loved and was calming to me. ⠀\n⠀\n😷Deep breathing and meditation when I take it off (in my car, at home, etc.) to help relax the tension and anxiety that is my body\u2019s natural response to trauma triggers.⠀\n⠀\n😷 Finding a mask that came up front on my chin more, rather than back to my throat, to reduce the sensation of being choked. In addition my mask does not have a wire in it, so while it covers my entire face, it is loose enough that I feel like I can breathe, not feeling like I\u2019m suffocating, nor the feeling of having something completely strapped to my face. ⠀\n⠀\n😷most of all - I stay in contact with my support. Those that have understood trauma and how it affects the body, and continue to take care of my mental health using coping skills in the process. ⠀\n⠀\nHope these tips can help you too.
