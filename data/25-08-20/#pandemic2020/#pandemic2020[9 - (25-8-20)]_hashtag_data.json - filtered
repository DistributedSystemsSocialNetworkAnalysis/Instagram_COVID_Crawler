Individuals staying alone at home, with the other predisposing conditions, have a higher tendency to attempt a walk along the painful road than if the conditions were different.\n\nAs the decibels of the blame game continues to rise following the considered errors of judgment by some people, especially how their \u2018wrong choices\u2019 may have impacted heavily on the material conditions of others, some of those at the receiving end of the blame game might consider suicide as a dignified route after apologising for their errors.

I was going to just let it go and take a break from it. But, maybe that\u2019s not the answer. Maybe I should explain. \n\nYou see- some of us are still out here worrying about a pandemic. Worrying about getting exposed. Worried about infecting our loved ones. Worrying for our patients. Worrying about the fall and winter hospital capacity. Trying to ignore the recruiting emails to go to Texas and Florida to work 70 hour weeks because they are so desperate. \n\nYou see- some of us are still wearing masks for 8-12 hours straight and not eating or drinking on shift. I was running around the department on my last overnight shift and finally reached a point where I started dry heaving. I went in the doc box, ripped off the mask and took 30 seconds to catch my breath and then I put the mask back on and put a chest tube in someone at 4AM. \n\nYou see- that patient I was worried about dying? The one who looked me in the eyes before I intubated him and was terrified? He did die. Took awhile. But he\u2019s gone now. Just like I thought he would be. He wasn\u2019t the only patient I lost these past few months from COVID. \n\nYou see- we had an entire family line up outside of the ambulance bay to see their intubated loved one be transferred to another hospital. They hadn\u2019t seen him in a month. \n\nYou see- every black patient I\u2019ve encountered in the last few months I\u2019ve been especially worried about how to protect them and be the best healthcare advocate I can for them because the truth is it took a civil rights movement to remind me that their lives matter just as much as white lives. That\u2019s the truth. I wasn\u2019t advocating equally even if I thought I was. \n\nYou see- every time I tell someone how I\u2019m really doing or what\u2019s really on my mind I can see the uncomfortable look on their face, shifting their weight while looking for the fastest way out of the conversation. \n\nContinued in the comments","NumberOfLikes":51,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1596509275,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 04 04:47:55 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#DailyUpdates #currentevents #currentaffairs #morning #follow #goodday #bless #love #life #India #hindustan #bharat #covid19 #lockdown2020 #pandemic2020 #narendramodi_primeminister #Post #Update #family #frndz #motivation\n\nFollow👇👇\n@knowledge_bank26 \nFollow👆👆","NumberOfLikes":15,"Hashtags":["#DailyUpdates","#currentevents","#currentaffairs","#morning","#follow","#goodday","#bless","#love","#life","#India","#hindustan","#bharat","#covid19","#lockdown2020","#pandemic2020","#narendramodi_primeminister","#Post","#Update","#family","#frndz","#motivation"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by knowledge_bank on August 03, 2020.

What we are experiencing now will seem mild by comparison.'\u201D\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nRead more with the link in our bio! #coronavirus #covid19 #covid_19 #pandemic #pandemic2020 #corona #covid #environment #unitednations #zoonotic #zoonoticepidemics #ebola #saras #westnile #riftvalleyfever #nature #natureshare #savetheplanet #meat #carnivore #carnivorediet #meatlover #deforestation #tropics #animalag #animalagriculture #pigshare #chickenshare #pigsofig #naturalworld","NumberOfLikes":18,"Hashtags":["#coronavirus","#covid19","#covid_19","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#corona","#covid","#environment","#unitednations","#zoonotic","#zoonoticepidemics","#ebola","#saras","#westnile","#riftvalleyfever","#nature","#natureshare","#savetheplanet","#meat","#carnivore","#carnivorediet","#meatlover","#deforestation","#tropics","#animalag","#animalagriculture","#pigshare","#chickenshare","#pigsofig","#naturalworld"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by the.vegan.baker on August 03, 2020.

We currently live in a state that has a very \u201Cyoung and healthy\u201D mindset. Mask wearing was presented as a suggestion for a long time. Now there is a mandate, but we are also holding parades and brunches, and concerts. All while socially distancing of course!  Well let me tell you something, the two cannot go hand in hand. I\u2019m not one to wave the \u201CI have a degree in public health,\u201D but look, I HAVE A DEGREE IN PUBLIC HEALTH, and we are all shaking our damn heads at your engagement parties and brunches. THIS WILL NEVER END. I also want to just scream from the rooftops how much your privilege is showing.  While you all are able to \u201Cescape to the mountains for a bit,\u201D there are people who don\u2019t even have a way to GET TO THE HOSPITAL if they have COVID. People are missing preventative healthcare appointments because they are too scared to take a Lyft. And do you know why we are not joining you for brunch or your \u201Cparty, with precautions?\u201D Because AMERICA IS RATIONING HEALTHCARE. AND WE ARE NOT ON THE LIST. We have to scream and yell to get our wishes granted in the hospital on a good day. In the current state? Forget it. PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ARE WRITING THEIR WISHES ON THEIR ARMS. WE ARE NOT ON THE LIST OF PEOPLE WHO WILL GET A VENTILATOR BECAUSE A MEDICAL RESIDENT DOESN\u2019T THINK OUR QUALITY OF LIFE IS THE SAME AS SOMEONE WHO CAN HIKE A MOUNTAIN. ONCE OUR VOICE IS GONE\u2026. WE MAY NOT SURVIVE. So yea. I miss my friends, I miss my family, I MISS BRUNCH ALSO. But until further notice, we have no choice. And guess what?  We are left behind. There are no more virtual shows, or beer tastings.  The resources have gone to those who are privileged enough to put their health at risk, cause they might get a ventilator. People are over virtual happy hours, because patios are open.  So yea. Please understand that I might be a bit hurt and resentful when I see you out socializing without masks.

Just thought of posting this because it is relating current situation. The things we are facing this year it's literally unacceptable. We faced so many things like covid-19 pandemic, lost so many legends, lost so many lives in flood etc. People who passed away this year never thought that it would happen ever with them. They were also having some plans which they wanted to fulfill or they left them it for future but the reality is that, their future was not as they expected.This song is giving a very genuine message to all of us that tomorrow may never come. Do whatever you want to do just do it today live your life happily, be happy with what you have and work for the things you want to do and most important thing live your life in present. Don't think about past and future because Past that is gone & the things that happened that can never be changed. Good things will happen, for sure, no matter what.

So for today\u2019s stop on my pandemic Hollywood tour we\u2019re visiting Indy\u2019s house from the film \u201CIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\u201D! \n\nThe fourth film in the series is set in 1957, nineteen years after \u201CThe Last Crusade\u201D. Indiana is having a quiet life teaching before being thrust into a new adventure. The film showcases Indiana\u2019s home, which is located in the city of Bedford in the state of Connecticut and was only previously seen in \u201CRaiders of the Lost Ark\".\n\nIn real life, Indy\u2019s home is a long way from Connecticut, it is located at \u202A476 Bradford Street\u202C in Pasadena! Please note that this is a private residence so if you visit please do not trespass or disturb the people that live there.\n\nFun facts - As nineteen years (both fictional and real) have passed, the filmmakers decorated the sparse living room with numerous artifacts Indiana has collected during his travels. There are also photos of Sallah, Marcus Brody, Willie Scott, Henry Jones, Sr., and Jones' Egypt adventure from the pilot episode of The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles placed around Indy\u2019s house. So the next time you watch the film see how many you can spot. \n\nHarrison Ford was adamant that he got to wield Indiana's famous whip. Paramount executives wanted the weapon to be computer generated because of new movie safety rules, but Ford branded the rule \u201Cridiculous\".\n\nCate Blanchett and Harrison Ford had never met before this movie. The first time they were introduced was on the first day of filming, where Indiana and Spalko first meet. Blanchett said it was ideal to be introduced to him dressed as Indiana Jones, because she\u2019d always been a big fan of the character. \n\nDuring the Hangar 51 scene, the theme for the Ark of the Covenant from \u201CRaiders of the Lost Ark\u201D is heard when the Ark makes its brief appearance. #filminglocation #indianajonesandthekingdomofthecrystalskull #indyshouse #harrisonford #indianajones #pasadena  #hollywoodtour #pandemic2020 #socialdistancing #wearamask #tonymiros","NumberOfLikes":55,"Hashtags":["#filminglocation","#indianajonesandthekingdomofthecrystalskull","#indyshouse","#harrisonford","#indianajones","#pasadena","#hollywoodtour","#pandemic2020","#socialdistancing","#wearamask","#tonymiros"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1596475538,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 03 19:25:38 CEST 2020","Location":"Pasadena, California"},{"CaptionText":"#coronavirus #covid_19 #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#coronavirus","#covid_19","#pandemic2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Mohammed Almas on August 03, 2020.

I honestly can\u2019t believe it\u2019s here. Obviously, this first semester is not going to be what I expected. Every school is dealing with the pandemic in different ways but here is how my first semester is different. As of right now, the only in-person class is anatomy lab. I\u2019m just excited to be here and am definitely ready to go with the flow.\nSome of the changes I have noticed: \n- Anatomy lab is split into 2 groups - each anatomy table (aka cadaver) has 5-6 people but we are split into two days. We each only do ~half of the anatomy labs. To be honest, I am kind of worried about this. Basically, the Tuesday group will do one dissection and the Thursday group will do another so that we can still finish the whole body by November. We will, of course, have an opportunity to see exactly what the other group did but it won\u2019t be the same as doing the lab ourselves.\n- Almost all of our classes are online! Some classes are live-zoom sessions (aka we have to be there and participate at a specific time) while others are pre-recorded lectures. This honestly does not really bother me, except in the case of Clinical Skills. I feel like it is going to be so difficult to learn to do a physician exam over Zoom? I have my first class on physical exams on Wednesday, so I\u2019ll let you guys know how it goes.\n- We have to buy more equipment ourselves. Many of the MS2\u2019s told us not to worry about buying BP cuffs and other physical exam equipment because we would be able to use the ones in the classrooms\u2026 but obviously that isn\u2019t the case right now.\n- Pretty much all extracurricular activities have paused. This isn\u2019t a huge deal since most students suggest giving yourself time to adjust to medical school classes before starting extracurriculars.\n- The most important difference (at least in my mind) is probably that I\u2019ve only met 2 of my classmates (my housemates)\n.\n.\n.\nHow has your school-year changed due to the pandemic.

We got a slice of #vegan pizza and we were going to sit somewhere at a distance of course, but there was a huge march going on in the town we were in. It was a anti black lives matter protest and for trump protest. They all came out of their Nazi basements and there they were! As it is their right to protest, like it is BLM\u2019s right, I\u2019m disgusted with this place! I found myself angry that this was close to where I lived, angry at the state of this country! Angry that people are still refusing to wear a mask (to be honest, I was hoping these people got covid, I know that\u2019s wrong 🤦🏻\u200D♀️. Some did wear mask though 🤷🏻\u200D♀️)! I\u2019m tired, scared, bitter, angry and hateful! If you don\u2019t think you are racist, then go and educate yourself as to why it can\u2019t be \u201Call lives matter\u201D! Also why \u201Cblue lives matter\u201D doesn\u2019t work either! My husband had pointed out there isn\u2019t anything for nurses (that we are aware of), but he doesn\u2019t expect or want there to be! This is his job and the job he chose to do, to treat patients, even those he doesn\u2019t like. He gets called the N word and f*ggot by his patients! He\u2019s also been stopped by police because the color of his skin and very wrong identification (on his way to work). Even so he will still care for those people with no hesitation! P.S. his job has become life threatening too, no thanks to asshole #POTUS!  This is their job! NOT their job to step on someone\u2019s neck, to profile someone because of their skin color! To murder someone\u2019s son or daughter because they were black and\/or wore a fukking hoody. Educate yourself about why BLM and not the other! We need to do better!

The numbers are just too high. The more people who have the virus in the community, the more likely it is that I I can pick it up and die, even though I\u2019m in home lockdown. If these changes are dramatically changing your life, then you are very privileged and you need to use the privilege wisely. Please do not say that it is impossible to stay home and that no one can do this, as that is completely erasing the voices and lives of many disabled\/chronically ill people. Most people in stage 4 restrictions will still be leaving the house more than I do without a pandemic. I don\u2019t work, don\u2019t go to the supermarket and don\u2019t leave the house for exercise. Leaving the house for medical care is all I really did. When this pandemic started, I was informed by my doctors that I would be on complete home lockdown for at least 18 months, so I accepted that and kept going. But the longer that this goes on, the longer it is that I have to go without adequate medical treatment. So every time someone breaks the rules, they are both trying to kill me, and extending the time that I will have to go without medical treatment. \nIn saying that, there are genuine reasons that you can leave your house after the curfew and out of your 5km radius. If you need to go to the hospital or see your doctor, go. That includes if you need mental health support. Victorians can now access an extra 10 sessions of psychological treatment covered by Medicare. That can be via telehealth, as can your doctors visits. If you need the help, get it. If you are experiencing domestic violence, you can leave your house at any time for help. Please leave and get help. \nThis level of lockdown should give you some insight into the lives of many disabled\/chronically ill people who are homebound. The world is actually far more accessible now that it has ever been. Working from home, online learning and medical telehealth were not started until healthy\/abled people needed it and it will probably be taken away after the pandemic is over. So I hope that you will start fighting for disabled rights and accessibility.","NumberOfLikes":30,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Alinta McMurdo in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

We feel so very lucky & priviledged to be living in Western Australia where the pandemic is currently under control ... But we must reflect that if we as humans don\u2019t learn from history and are therefore doomed to repeat it. The Spanish flu lasted for 2 years. The second wave killed far more people than the first, and in total there were 4 waves. It killed somewhere between 20 million to 50 million people. Citizens were ordered to wear masks, and everywhere shut down and boarded up schools, movie theatres, and business. Mail distribution stopped, as did garbage collection. Many people had to dig graves for their own family members. \nHere we are 100 years later, and what have we learned?  Half the people don\u2019t want to wear masks because they think it\u2019s a hoax\/it\u2019s not that bad\/the government is lying\/insert insane right wing conspiracy theory rhetoric here. \nPeople want to prioritize their own narcissistic desires and privileges over other human beings lives. \nWhat did they have in 1918? No TV. No internet, not a lot of food supply. \nWhat do we have? TV, internet, movies that can be watched from home, ubereats...you name it.

We survived the respiratory issues with lots of breathing treatments and steroids. On 7\/16 I started developing neurological deficits. My left side is incredibly weak. It feels like I have had a stroke. Todays 15 minute birthday party left me depleted. It has been difficult to access care because I have been positive for Covid.

Kerupuk⠀\nKerupuk memang enak dijadikan teman saat makan. Tapi tahukah anda jika 1 buah kerupuk putih mengandung 100-150 kalori atau sama dengan 1 porsi nasi.⠀\n.⠀\nSelain itu kerupuk terbuat dari tepung yang mengandung karbohidrat sederhana. kerupuk diproses dengan cara digoreng dalam minyak yang banyak sehingga meningkatkan jumlah kalori.ketika di konsumsi dan tidak beraktivitas maka kerupuk bisa menjadi lemak jahat bagi tubuh.⠀\n.⠀\n2. Gorengan⠀\nTernyata bakwan dan teman- temannya ini juga memiliki kalori super tinggi per potongnya lho. Bisa sampai 100-200 kalori. Meski enak, pengolahan georengan yg menggunakan tepung, minyak dan terkadang gula membuat gorengan jadi makanan tinggi lemak jahat yang bisa memicu kolestrol dan penyakit kardiovaskular.⠀\n.⠀\n3. Pop corn⠀\nCemilan yang paling asyik ini jadi teman nonton ini juga ternyata punya jumlah kalori yang sangat besar lho. Dikutip dari The Food Standards Agency (FSA), pop corn manis dan asin kurang baik bagi kesehatan karena kalorinya yang tinggi, namun tidak membuat kenyang sehingga konsumsi popcorn bisa berlebihan dan menyebabkan obesitas. Menurut FSA 1 porsi pop corn manis di bioskop bisa mengamdung hingga 1800 kalori, sedangkan yang asin mengandung kalori hingga 1779!⠀\n.⠀\n4. Mie instan⠀\nNah yang satu ini makanan favorit banyak orang nih. Namun ternyata satu porsi mie instan per kemasan (70 gram) bisa mengandung kalori hingga 370 atau sama dengan sekitar empat porsi nasi. Selain itu penggunaan pengawet dan MSG dalam bumbu mie instan juga berbahaya bagi tubuh jika dikonsumsi terllu sering. ⠀\nGaeess kamu paling suka yang mana nih.?

In today\u2019s portion, the disciples lamentably failed, like a person who understands the theory but cannot apply it in practice. 15 When it was evening, the disciples came to him and said, \u201CThis is a deserted place, and the hour is now late; send the crowds away so that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves.\u201D 16 Jesus said to them, \u201CThey need not go away; you give them something to eat.\u201D 17 They replied, \u201CWe have nothing here but five loaves and two fish.\u201D\n\nTo read more cut and paste link below:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/notes\/st-augustines-episcopal-church\/between-theory-and-practice-what-we-must-do-as-disciples\/3440976235926877\/\n\n#churchonline#churchfamily \n#community#les \n#discussion #church\n#sundayservice\n#covid19#togetherapart \n#pandemic2020#episcopal \n#episcopalchurch#service \n#staysafe#disiples \n#lowereastside#transformation \n#historicalchurch#comevisit \n#slavegalleries#history \n#theoryandpractice#rector","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#churchonlin","#churchfamily","#communit","#les","#discussion","#church","#sundayservice","#covid1","#togetherapart","#pandemic202","#episcopal","#episcopalchurc","#service","#staysaf","#disiples","#lowereastsid","#transformation","#historicalchurc","#comevisit","#slavegallerie","#history","#theoryandpractic","#rector"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1596382838,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 02 17:40:38 CEST 2020","Location":"St Augustine's Episcopal Church"},{"CaptionText":"The moon. \n.. \n.. \n.. \n#pandemicart\n#pandemiclife \n#pandemic2020 \n#pandemic \n#pandemicpoetry\n#writersofinstagram \n#writerlife\n#zines \n#zinester\n#zinestagram \n#wordsmatter\n#wordsgasm \n#deardiary\n#pandemicdiary","NumberOfLikes":9,"Hashtags":["#pandemicart","#pandemiclife","#pandemic2020","#pandemic","#pandemicpoetry","#writersofinstagram","#writerlife","#zines","#zinester","#zinestagram","#wordsmatter","#wordsgasm","#deardiary","#pandemicdiary"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Dear Diary on August 02, 2020.

I want you to know, you are respected for whatever decisions you make, that are right for you and your family.\n\nTo families who are weighing benefits versus risks for health and education for your children this school year, hang in there and do what's right for your family. \n\nThank you again for all you are doing Teachers and Administrators!","NumberOfLikes":15,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Becky Cooper on August 02, 2020.

Having late lunch at the excellent restaurant Mandu @pierogarniamandu serving famous Polish speciality pierogi (stuffed pasta parcels, a bit like dumplings)  feels like a true luxury! \n\nI am incredibly grateful for every moment spent with my mum. My heart goes out to all those of you who like me, were born and bred in one place and ended up living some place else, thousands of miles away, but are still unable to visit your family and friends.
