It is not inherited. And oftentimes, greatness isn't appreciated or recognised until you see greatness anywhere no more\u2063.\n\u2063\n🤫The secret of greatness lies within you. There is no discrimination from God. Anybody can be great. You have the formula of greatness inside you. It depends on you if you want to be great. If you want to be great, you can be great.\u2063\n\u2063\nThat secret recipe of greatness is inside you. There are so many souls inside you. Nothing is out of your reach. When you reach God, you will be at the pinnacle of your journey. That is the culmination.\u2063\n\u2063\nGreatness is not inherited.\u2063\n\u2063\n👨\u200D✈️ If your father is a pilot, do you assume you will be a pilot all by yourself, without any training or education? If your father is a great batsman, do you think you'll be a great batsman without making any effort? Why then do people think that if the father is a saint of God, then the son or daughter will be a saint of God too?\u2063\n\u2063\n❤️You will be a saint of God if God wants you to be his friend. It depends on God and you. Your family is not involved; the decision is taken by God. If God is willing, he will accept you as a friend. \u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n#ALRATV #GoharShahi #YounusAlGohar #sufi #sufism #agapelove #saint #fate #divinelove #lovequotes #divine #purification #compassion #greatness #selfesteem #selfimprovement #creation #Nirvana #higherself #theself #happiness #motivation #UniversalSufi #hope #socialdistance #hope #strength #positiveenergy #enlightenment #evolve","NumberOfLikes":0,"Hashtags":["#Repost","#ALRATV","#GoharShahi","#YounusAlGohar","#sufi","#sufism","#agapelove","#saint","#fate","#divinelove","#lovequotes","#divine","#purification","#compassion","#greatness","#selfesteem","#selfimprovement","#creation","#Nirvana","#higherself","#theself","#happiness","#motivation","#UniversalSufi","#hope","#socialdistance","#hope","#strength","#positiveenergy","#enlightenment","#evolve"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Tahira Mateen on August 24, 2020.

As many of you are aware, I hadn\u2019t left my house (apart from the occasional car ride to nowhere & one road trip to see the same two people I\u2019ve been seeing since June \u2014 my mom & sister) in six months. Saturday night, my sister rented out a movie theater so we could watch Harry Potter & the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone, alone. (It wasn\u2019t too pricey at all, by the way!) Seriously, it was just my husband, my sister, & myself. We watched a movie we\u2019ve seen a hundred times. We were by ourselves. We ate popcorn & drank soda that were unnecessarily expensive. It felt like I got some normalcy back, except for the mask-wearing, frequent washing of the hands, hand-sanitizing, remaining six-feet away from people I wasn\u2019t usually with, & legit flushing the public restroom toilet with my shoe (because I was not about to touch that nastiness with my hand). I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t have at least a few anxiety attacks as we pulled into the parking lot or while we made our way through the main lobby of the theater, but it felt good to get out a bit. Now, we\u2019re headed back to our home in New York, four hours away, where I\u2019ll remain until Rosh Hashana (the Jewish New Year) gets here.

Dat kan alleen als mensen zich laagdrempelig laten testen. Dan kunnen mensen die besmet zijn met het virus zo snel mogelijk in quarantaine en verspreiden zij het virus niet verder. Weet u nog de vergelijking met het verkeer? Een van de belangrijkste maatregelen om verspreiding en een nieuwe uitbraak te voorkomen is snelle signalering en aanpak, als uw remmen het niet doen dan gaat u ook naar de garage om het te laten testen. En\u2026 ik zeg het nog maar een keer: het coronavirus kan ook mild verlopen! \n \nEr zijn veel vragen over testen \u2013 hoe goed is de PCR test eigenlijk? Dit is de test die door de GGD wordt gebruikt door materiaal achter uit de keel en de neus af te nemen. Het korte antwoord is dat deze test, zoals gedaan in de officiële laboratoria goed, het nieuwe coronavirus kan aantonen. Het gaat dan dus om dit coronavirus en niet om de andere coronavirussen die er al waren. Overigens meet deze test je wel OF je het nieuwe coronavirus hebt, maar deze test zegt niets over HOE BESMETTELIJK je bent. Niet 1 test is waterdicht, soms is de test negatief (geen coronavirus) terwijl er wel duidelijk klachten zijn. Ook dan is het belangrijk om gezond verstand te blijven gebruiken, misschien heb je het toch. Overleg bij twijfel met je huisarts.\n \nDe testen die via internet door commerciële partijen worden aangeboden, zijn niet betrouwbaar genoeg en worden afgeraden.","NumberOfLikes":21,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598253984,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 24 09:26:24 CEST 2020","Location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands"},{"CaptionText":"MauKah Anda?? bekerja dengan perusahaan Jepang\nBerikut 5 keuntungan berbisnis franchise dengan perusahaan farmasi Jepang..

This 'walk' was only 6km but my goodness it was impressive. I'd noted some waterfalls marked on a map opposite a popular walking spot, so I looked for an appropriate track to see if I could get in and have a look. Well, I found the track and bashed my way in (it was petty overgrown) and got the chance to walk up alongside this amazing river. \n\nThis is Little River (one of 3 Little Rivers I know of in Victoria). The river has a funny sort of path. It travels in a shallow valley about 1,000m above sea level and then turn left. As it turns it progressively drops around 500m over a distance of maybe 5km. In the middle of winter the tall hills and mountains east of Melbourne capture storms and showers and then funnels them into fast moving rivers. During the wetter months the racing white water puts on a dramatic show of force.\n\n#igaustralia #hikeon  #explorethemountains #hikerforlife #trailhiking #trailhikingaust #victoriawalks #bushwalkingvictoria #isolation #socialdistance #parksvictoria #cathedralranges #taungurungcountry #cathedralrangesstatepark #discoverdindi","NumberOfLikes":111,"Hashtags":["#igaustralia","#hikeon","#explorethemountains","#hikerforlife","#trailhiking","#trailhikingaust","#victoriawalks","#bushwalkingvictoria","#isolation","#socialdistance","#parksvictoria","#cathedralranges","#taungurungcountry","#cathedralrangesstatepark","#discoverdindi"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Deano the Weekend Wanderer in Cathedral Range State Park.
