Lil has come to live with us forever! When my parents adopted me, Lillian stayed with our foster family because she has a rare congenital heart defect (I was born with one eye, she was born with a rare heart defect... can you say puppy mill?!). Initially the cardiologists only gave her months to live, but as she grew it became apparent Lil wasn\u2019t slowing down at all! We sought a second opinion and that cardiologist, along with another at Colorado State, think that Lil might be able to live until middle age with just palliative care! I begged my parents to see if Lil could come live with us, but little did I know that they had already decided that there was no way we could turn our backs on family! Tenley, Harper and I are so excited to add Lil to our pack... and my parents are also so excited, though I have heard them whisper to each other that they are a \u201Cgood kind of crazy\u201D.... whatever that means. All I know is the dogs now out number the people 2:1 in our house, so what we say GOES. \n\nAlso, while Lil and I are adorable and sweet as can be (I\u2019m super humble), we exist as proof of why you should never support puppy mills! To learn more about puppy mills and the campaigns to end them, check out @bailing_out_benji \n\nWe can\u2019t wait to share our adventures with you! Thank you as always to @danpbull and @carilbieber for taking such good care of Lillian (and me).

Whirl all of the ingredients in the blender until smooth, up to 5 minutes.\n2. Enjoy!\n\nA few tips for smoothie success:\n\n1. To boost creaminess, freeze the fruit (except for citrus fruit). You also can add a few tablespoons of Organic Valley Nonfat Dry Milk Powder for a rich, creamy taste without the guilt.\n\n2. For extra protein, add a handful of raw almonds.\n\n3. Blend a few tablespoons of raw flax seeds for omega-3 fatty acids. Add a handful of raw sunflower seeds for your daily dose of omega-6 and omega-9 fatty acids as well as vitamin E.\n\n4. Add liquids first and gradually add seeds and nuts and then frozen fruit. Liquid extracts (such as vanilla or almond extracts) go in last.\n\n5.

Here are a few mask tips for kids from @ameracadpeds:\n\n* Mask should not be placed on children under the age of two years old \n* Mask should fit over your child's nose, mouth, and be secured under their chin. Always check that your child can breathe easily when wearing the mask \n* Children should wash their hands before and after wearing a mask\n* Designate your child as the family \"mask monitor.\" When leaving the house, have them check that everyone has their mask available. Giving children a job or responsibility can help them feel empowered and more in control of a situation\n* For children who may find it difficult to wear a mask, have them look in the mirror with their mask on and talk about why it is important to wear a mask and why people are wearing them \n* Put a mask on a favorite stuffed animal\n* Decorate the mask so they're more personalized and fun and less scary\n* Show your child pictures of other children wearing mask\n* Draw a mask on their favorite character\n* Practice wearing a mask at home to help your child get use to it\n* Set an example and wear a mask yourself and provide positive reinforcement when your child wears one\n* Wash and dry mask after every use\n\n#facemask #facecovering #facemasksupplier #facemasksgoals #reusablemask #maskup #maskon #masked #masks #stopthespread #weareinthistogether #socialdistance #wearamask #staysafe #protectyourself #protectothers #washyourhands","NumberOfLikes":32,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by clowneymasks on August 19, 2020.

Sel-sel ini bertanggung jawab untuk menjaga tubuh kita bekerja setiap harinya, seperti membuat jantung kita berdetak, otak kita berpikir, ginjal membersihkan darah kita, mengganti kulit yang terkelupas, dan seterusnya. Tugas khusus dari stem cell adalah untuk menciptakan berbagai jenis sel tersebut. Stem cell adalah sumber untuk sel-sel baru. Pada saat stem cell membelah, mereka dapat memperbanyak diri sendiri atau menjadi jenis sel yang lain. Contohnya, stem cell di kulit dapat menciptakan lebih banyak stem cell kulit atau mereka dapat membuat sel kulit terdiferensiasi yang memiliki tugas spesifik seperti membuat pigmen melanin.\n\nKenapa Stemcell penting untuk kita?\n\nSaat kita terluka atau sakit, sel kita juga terluka atau mati. Saat hal ini terjadi, stem cell menjadi aktif. Stem cell memiliki tugas untuk memperbaiki jaringan yang terluka atau menggantikan sel lain pada saat mereka mengalami kematian rutin. Dengan cara ini, stem cell kita menjaga kita tetap sehat dan mencegah kita dari penuaan dini. Stem cell bertindak seperti pasukan dokter mikroskopis milik kita sendiri.\n\nSumber : ipscell.com\n.\n.info lebih lanjut call 082245459759\n\n#afclifescience #afcjapan #kesehatan #sop100 #sop100plus #salmon #salmonovarypeptide #utshukushii #antitumor #kanker #jantung #stroke #ginjal #gagalginjal #diabetes #asma #tumor #antiaging #autoimun #healthsupplement #healthsupplements #covid #coronavirus #virus #stemcell #cell #socialdistancing #socialdistance #stayhome #stayhealthy","NumberOfLikes":1,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by AFC by Stephen in Malang.

To support 'social distancing', the campsite provided each household with a toilet, a tap and a pitch that was ten metres distant from the adjoining ones. So, physically we were protected.⠀\n⠀\nBut how are we doing emotionally when we keep a physical distance? What happens when there is a strong longing for personal connection, seeing each other and hearing each in the flesh? One person expressed her sadness that she is missing hugging, and for her 'social distancing' doesn't mean that she wants 'social distance'. No, not at all!

I chose #LandsEnd. This was the longest walk so far at over 5 miles. I began at #SutroHeightsPark, once private residence to the 24th #SF mayor, #AdolfSutro now turned public garden park.  22 acres of serene #OceanBeach and #CliffHouse views. From here I walked across the street to El Camino Del Mar which leads into the #LandsEndTrail \/ #CoastalTrail. Stairs are all through this walk, lots and lots of stairs. It\u2019s a great rugged hike. I chose a couple stopping points along the way. The #LandsEndLabyrinth built in 2004 by SF artist #EduardoAguilara. Such a magical piece with a great view of  the #GoldenGateBridge. Walking the #labyrinth really gives you a sense of #peace especially with the sounds of the ocean. From here I made my way down to #MileRockBeach. Side note, most of these paths are tight and rocky, so be very careful and try to respectfully #socialdistance. A lot of people like this trail so there is a lot of stop and go, which isn\u2019t bad when you need to catch your breath.  Mile Rock Beach is so cute with rocks shaped like a #heart at the landing. It\u2019s perfectly romantic. Onward I trekked allllll the way back up to the the trail #phew and\nbasically followed the Golden Gate Bridge. The trail ends at Lincoln highway which I followed up to #LegionofHonor. I can\u2019t wait for museums to be open again but it was nice to see Rodin\u2019s #Thinker from a distance. I continued on to the grand finale of this walk the #LincolnParkStairway, inbetween the #LincolnGolfCourse and #KatherineBurkeSchool. 52 glorious steps created by @aileen.barr completed in 2015. She also had a hand in quite a few mosaic steps in the city, including the famous 16th Ave Tiled Steps. Thanks for beautifying all these steps Aileen! I continued my way back to Sutro Heights Park via Clement to get my neighborhood feel on. Outer Richmond was always \u201Cfar\u201D to me so I was glad to leisurely admire the houses.

We all are facing challenges and difficulties condensed into just a couple of months. I personally have seen acquaintances and family members pass away in the last six months and last Friday night an uncle of mine passed away. My family is devastated. It is never easy to say goodbye or to let go, it is even harder when you can\u2019t say goodbye through the rituals we perform to represent the ending of a life cycle, and coming to terms with the idea that you won\u2019t see your love ones again. With the current situation, we are force to create our own individual rituals to honor them so we can start our own process of grief, all this while trying to find connection and comfort through video calls with the people we care about. \n.\nTomorrow will mark six years since I arrived in New York. A lot has changed in the world, particularly in the USA and Colombia where I am from. But I wish more than ever that I was in Colombia right now with my family to be with them in this period of grief. \n .\nWear a mask, social distance and avoid parties, you can wait another year for that.

Snot and boogers can spread germs 👾👾 that carry coronavirus. When someone coughs or sneezes it lands on door handles, tables, iphones and pencils. Even sandwiches 🥪🌭. The germs can stick there for a few days. If you stand too close to somebody, who coughs or sneezes 🤧🤧, you might breathe it in. They're so small you cant even see them. Make sure to keep your distance (about 2 kid moko jumbie sticks away ~6ft). And wash your hands a lot, a lot. With soap and bubbles or hand sanitizer. \n\nYou might need to spend a lot of time around your home to avoid spreading the virus. If you go outside, wear your mask 😷😷 as much as possible. Over your nose and mouth, not upside down or inside out. Or even your friend's mask. Thats gross.\n\nDo go outside and play. If you have stilts, walk tall. If you have a bike, ride like the wind.

We are exposed to higher wavelengths like UVA and UVB radiation that can cause DNA damage 💥🔥of our skin and thus lead to skin cancers like melanoma (very aggressive and can be fatal). \u2063\n\u2063\nThere are a few articles that came out studying the effects of UVB on SARS-CoV-2 on SURFACES in laboratory settings using dried simulated saliva. It has been shown that UVB can deactivate the virus in 10-30 minutes depending on the time of day, latitude, season or DROPLET SIZE. \u2063\n\u2063\nMy take:\u2063\nI came out on FB Live earlier and reminded everyone on how it can live on surfaces for a few days and studies have claimed that it can still be infectious or even re-aerosolize. UV light may be disinfecting the outdoor surfaces this summer but this should NOT mean that you can feel safe congregating in groups during this warm season. Moreover, we are seeing horrific numbers once again during the summer months most notably in my tropical home state of Hawaii. Sitting out and tanning with your friends will not prevent you from inhaling infected droplets from others and tanning will not help you once you are infected. \u2063\n\u2063\nDr. Penny Ward (professor in pharmaceutical medicine in Kings College London) summed it up, \u201CUV radiation and heat are known to kill virus particles on surfaces. But neither sitting in the sun, nor heating, will kill a virus replicating in an individual patient\u2019s internal organs.\u201D \u2063\n\u2063\nWe are all trying to learn more about this virus together. You can form your own opinion on the matter but here is what I gathered and here is my take. \u2063\n\u2063\nTake care everyone ✌️\u2063\n\u2063\nThank you @technigadgets for the sunglasses.","NumberOfLikes":313,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Dr. Daniel Sugai, MD, FAAD on August 17, 2020.

I love and miss the hugs and the laughs with my students. \n\nBut, safety first! We know this is only temporary. I feel bad for parents who have multiple kids, who have full time jobs, or English is a barrier, ugh and of course, our kids. We are all struggling. We (teachers) are too having one of the worst experiences of our professional life, I know I am. Parents\/Guardians know that we are sensitive to your feelings & family's needs. I wish I could do more. It has been hard to adjust and accept the changes. I can't imagine how hard it is for our kids, but if we can learn one thing from them is resilience. Seeing my kids smiles (excitement, positive vibes) today, even if only online, motivated me and reminded me why I love teaching. I can't wait to go back to classrooms but ONLY IF ITS SAFE FOR ALL.

For patients recovering at home, treatment is mainly #supportive. For people with #mild symptoms, this means staying well rested, drinking plenty of fluids, and monitoring symptoms. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever or chills, cough, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, runny nose or congestion, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea. Some people have more severe symptoms that require hospitalization.\n\nWhat Is Preventive Care?\n\nYou can be infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) while taking care of someone with COVID-19. Although there is not yet a vaccine to prevent COVID-19, infection is preventable. The most important steps to #prevent spread are wearing a #mask, maintaining #socialdistance whenever possible, #washinghands often, and #cleaning and #sanitizing the home.\n\nFor More Information\n* \tCaring for someone sick (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC])\u2028www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/if-you-are-sick\/care-for-someone.html\n* \tClinical care guidance (CDC)\u2028www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/hcp\/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html","NumberOfLikes":26,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Dr Sandhya Ramanathan on August 17, 2020.

But it's important we realize that most of the negative or even positive experiences we run into should not have negative long-term effects on our health.\n\nFor example, we all know a person that seemed dedicated to being healthy, but once they got in a relationship, got married or a new job everything changed. Although it's completely understandable that seemingly life-changing events could inevitably impact your health, at the most they should be a small speed bump, not a roadblock and U-turn, to being healthy.\n-\n\"Life happens\" is a saying and mindset I've adopted that basically encompasses everything bad or good could occur during my lifetime. Each of these events will affect me in some way, but ultimately it's how I choose to respond that will determine my future. So no matter if I lose my job, or my car breaks down, or I move to another state, or I start dating, or anything else that could and probably will happen, I will always try get back on track with health goals as soon as possible. And no it's not always about having abs or lifting heavy, it's about being able to do normal people things at the age of 60, 70, even 80 💪🏾👴🏾","NumberOfLikes":93,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":10,"Timestamp":1597681460,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 18:24:20 CEST 2020","Location":"Crunch Fitness"},{"CaptionText":"Hustle, Kick, Win!!!
