Here are 3 mask facts to help keep you and others safe:\n\nFact 1: If you previously had #covid19 or tested positive for the COVID-19 antibodies, you should still wear a mask.\n\nScientists do not yet know enough about the amount of protection COVID-19 antibodies provide us or how long. This means a positive antibody test does not yet definitively indicate whether you can get infected again or if you can infect others with the virus. Until we know, it is best to continue to stay safe by continuing to wear a mask and social-distance.\n\nFact 2: You still need to wear your mask outside.\n\nYou should continue to wear a mask whenever you leave your house unless you are social-distanced outdoors or with people only from your household.\n\nFact 3: Your mask should cover both your mouth and nose for full protection.\n\nRespiratory droplets could contain COVID-19 and can transmit out through your nose. Make sure your mask fits snugly just under the bridge of your nose and stops right below your chin. \n.\n.\n.\n.\n#HealthTap #telemedicine #telemedicineawareness #telehealth #telehealthcare #healthcareinnovation #healthcaretechnology #healthcareindustry #healthcaresolutions #healthcaresystem #digitalhealthcare #homehealth #homehealthcare #wearamask #washyourhands #socialdistance #covid19tips #stopthespread #staysafe #socialdistancing #masks #mask #howto #masktips #masks101 #masksafety #diy #didyouknow","NumberOfLikes":13,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by HealthTap on August 14, 2020.

Automatic doors so you don\u2019t need to touch the handle, people operating lifts so you don\u2019t have to press buttons, and probably even ditching away with the communal coffee machine for some other contact-less alternative. Workspaces will become more safety conscious, and more impersonal, with employees having dedicated agile and versatile cubicles to suit all their needs. @keith_melbourne envisioned how design intervention can create a new sort of stylish-yet-safe workplace with the Avion.\u2060⠀\n\u2060⠀\nThe Avion is a modular workspace setup that comes with a contemporary design with soft curves, chic furniture, and a modern color palette to help make the workspace look friendly and appealing. Designed to create visual comfort so you\u2019re more focused and relaxed at work, the cubicle systems isolate you and provide enough space to work out of, while still giving you enough of a window to step out and socialize from time to time\u2026 from a distance of course!\u2060⠀\n\u2060⠀\nDesigner: Keith Melbourne Studio\u2060 via @mesmerized_design ⠀\n\u2060⠀.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n#product #productdesign #industrialdesign #innovation #moderndesign #designinspiration #designspiration #designporn #designideas #designlife #productdesigner #industrialdesigner #innovative #YankoDesign #designlovers #socialdistancing #socialdistancing2020 #socialdistance #workspace #workspacedesign #workspaces #modular","NumberOfLikes":6348,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":10,"Timestamp":1597396332,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 14 11:12:12 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Fancy some authentic Sichuan cuisine without the 16hr flight?\n\nTag a eat out buddy ⭐\n.\n50% off your final bill or value of £10 off person ( Mon - Wed)\n.\n#staysafe #socialdistance #szechuancuisine #dragoninnclub #victoria #eatouttohelpout #london #sichuanhotpot #eatouttohelpoutscheme","NumberOfLikes":25,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Dragon Inn Club | 龍門客棧 | Ldn on August 14, 2020.

I was excited to see the clouds and light return as it\u2019s been a few weeks since we\u2019ve had good clouds and light. Today is day #150 since we\u2019ve started sheltering in place. I\u2019ve been missing a lot of sunsets because every night at 8, our neighborhood puts on a concert. We started on Easter Sunday and have now played 117 concerts with only a few missed days here and there. We started off howling to thank frontline workers and it\u2019s evolved to multi-instrument concerts. There are some days where I\u2019m so busy with work and keeping the kids busy (or from killing each other) that it\u2019s the only time I get to step outside. I play the flute, my son plays the trumpet\/piano, my other son the piano\/ukulele, and my husband occasionally plays the piano as well.  We have neighbors who play the trombone, guitar, ukulele and mandolin.  In those 117 days, we\u2019ve celebrated a graduation, numerous birthdays and even bid farewell to a neighbor who moved after living in the neighborhood for 28 years. Despite being in the neighborhood for 14 years, we\u2019ve gotten to really bond with everyone and get to know them better. As much as I love a good sunset, the tradeoff has definitely been worth it. After 117 days, we\u2019re always looking for new songs to play. If you have any suggestions, please write it in the comments.  How have you all been and what have you been doing during this unique time?  I hope you\u2019re all staying healthy and wearing those masks. ☺️😷💜\n.\n.\n.\n#sunsetlight #paintedsky #colorfulclouds #sunsetbeauty #beautyiseverywhere #theskyabove #silhouettephotography #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife #wearamask #frontlineheroes #frontlineworkers #bayareasunset #eastbay #savoringeverymoment #sunsetvibes #oaklandcalifornia #keepmovingforward #hanginthere #wegotthis #flatteningthecurve #socialdistance #lastdaysofsummer #backtoschool","NumberOfLikes":176,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":32,"Timestamp":1597386133,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 14 08:22:13 CEST 2020","Location":"Oakland, California"},{"CaptionText":"Ready for Saturday Evening's Sip N Paint art class!

We take date all the time without realizing it. Looking at the number of steps you\u2019ve taken on your Fitbit each day is data collection, weighing yourself on a scale every Saturday is data collection, and getting a grade in school is data collection. Likewise, if you want to help your child improve with social distancing, then keep track of how they do each day. Data collection may include:\n\n1) How frequently your child demonstrates social distancing correctly vs. incorrectly (Activities A,B, C, D, and F) compared to the number of opportunities or the time that has elapsed.\n\n2) How long your child demonstrates social distancing correctly (Activity E) At a minimum, keep track of the amount of success your child has each day so you can compare it to the next.

It is fertile ground; the place where children strengthen social bonds, build emotional maturity, develop cognitive skills, and shore up their physical health. 💚⠀\n⠀\nKids know intuitively that play time is essential. Many teachers and parents also understand that it\u2019s crucial for a child\u2019s proper development. And increasingly, science is supporting this argument.⠀\nFor example, The Atlantic article refers to studies stating that free unstructured play helps children develop self-regulation skills, which helps them calm themselves and focus in class.⠀\nWe know that both structured activities and free play are essential for kids\u2019 proper development. But times have changed and for so many of us, with both parents working, there is often no other option but to program children with camps and activities during the summer. So how can we make sure that our kids get their unstructured time? 🌻⠀\n⠀\nHere are some suggestions:⠀\nMake frequent trips to the playground and let your kids take risks⠀\nVisit farms, forests, and ravines where kids can explore nature⠀\nBecome a play angel so your kids will have a safe environment for kid-led play⠀\nChoose a camp that values free play and discovery time for kids⠀\nStart a Parent Club with a group of friends⠀\nMake sure evenings and weekends include lots of downtime.⠀\nThough challenging, it\u2019s definitely not impossible to give kids the freedom they need during their break from the school year. How do you make sure your kids have time for free play?⠀\n⠀\nhttps:\/\/buff.ly\/33ybDGV","NumberOfLikes":19,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Champions for Life Foundation on August 13, 2020.

We had to adjust our routines and make mask wearing a norm.\n\nI started sewing to entertain my mind, and teaching my six children. This was hard as I don't have the skills of a high school or primary school teacher. My 8 month old baby crawling around sure keeps me on my toes!

Why not make that letter a greeting card? And why not make that greeting card a #finkelsteinoriginal ?\nAlso, it doesn\u2019t have to be a Father\u2019s Day card either.

Due to the increase in COVID-19 cases the Health Officers agree that, until the COVID incidence rate decreases, in-person instruction is not safe or recommended in North Central Washington.\n\nAs of this date, based upon best available evidence, the Health Officers of Chelan, Douglas, Grant, Kittitas, and Okanogan counties support the following approach, which reflects Washington State Department of Health\nguidance:\n\n\u2022 Schools and educators must be considered \u201Cessential businesses\u201D and \u201Cessential workers\u201D\no Appropriate Personal Protective Equipment must be made available for staff and students to\nminimize risks during classroom instruction\no Appropriate funding must be made available for engineering controls to minimize risks during\nclassroom instruction\no All accommodations made for other essential businesses should be extended to schools and\neducators, inclusive of remote education continuing through any future stay home orders.\n\n\u2022 The county Health Officers do not support a return to in-person classroom instruction when the county\u2019s incidence of COVID-19 is above 75 cases per 100,000 for 2 consecutive weeks (14 days).\n\n\u2022 The county Health Officers do support a hybrid approach with K-5 and other educationally high-risk groups in-person in classrooms with COVID precautions when the county\u2019s incidence of COVID-19 is less than 75 cases per 100,000 for 2 consecutive weeks (14 days).\n\n\u2022 The county Health Officers support return to in-person classroom instruction for all student populations, with COVID-19 precautions, when the county incidence of COVID-19 is 25 cases per 100,000 for 2 consecutive weeks (14 days).\n\n\u2022 School districts may petition the local public health jurisdiction for an exception to these reopening thresholds and other standards. Such petitions should be founded in evidence, on a reasonable basis, and with supporting rationale.\n\nThe full school guidance document is located on www.okanogancountycovid19.org","NumberOfLikes":2,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Okanogan County Public Health on August 12, 2020.
