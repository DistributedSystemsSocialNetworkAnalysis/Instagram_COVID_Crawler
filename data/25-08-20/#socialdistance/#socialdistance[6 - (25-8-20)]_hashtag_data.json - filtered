Please take time to read.\n\nI love going to the gym and fitness in general. It's a part of me and my lifestyle. It helps me relieve stress, keep my sanity and feel better about myself.  With what's been going on in the world I had to stop going to the gym. I think its more reasonable to be carefull and try not get or spread the virus and protect your loved ones and others than a bunch of muscles. Its not easy, the gym is a very important thing for me and not being able to go it messes me up. Even though I workout regularly from home  and go for runs here and there, I still miss the gym, it's not the same. Truth is I lost a lot of muscle, i'm trying hard to maintain, to keep my cool and the itch to go. One thing is certain, when things get better and go back to normal  i'm gonna go hard and go back to where I left of and become even better. What I know for sure from the whole situation  is that i indeed grew stronger and became a better version of myself mentally. Till everything is right again, don't go left, stay safe, keep social distance, wear a mask, be grateful, be strong and be patient. The more carefull and smart we are the sooner it will all go away and we'll get back to normal.\n\n#gym #workingout #fitness #healthylifestyle  #lovethegym #loveworkingout #fitnessislife #excersiceislive #bodybuilding #rows #covid19 #coronavirus #socialdistancing #staysafe #socialdistance #stayhome #wearamask","NumberOfLikes":4,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597238578,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 12 15:22:58 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#socialdistance #hasselblad #lacanicule #streetphotography","NumberOfLikes":5,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Keith Woolcock in Rue du Louvre.

When I posted I\u2019m adopting 2 families in Tampa. My inbox was flooded with people that wanted to help. A few non profits reached out to me about a partnership and I received donations via cashapp from those who supported the cause. Every cashapp I received match my donation amount. \n\nNeedless to say in addition to the two families I adopted, 3 additional families were adopted as well.

In addition, my next step is to adopt a school. I want to pay fo the lunches of those kids who parents opt for their child to stay home and do online learning. Somehow the school board thought it was cool to withhold lunch for students who will be doing online learning instead of physically coming into school. This is sad and uncalled for! I feel like they are targeting a certain group (just my opinion). I feel like they have no empathy for what\u2019s going on and only care about the funding that will be cut if kids are not seated in a classroom. \n\nMy question is, if you can give away millions of lunches for free at the beginning of the pandemic, why withhold lunch to those who will be continuing online learning 😡\n\nIt\u2019s time to get to work and help our people because THEY aren\u2019t willing to do so✊🏽","NumberOfLikes":90,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Sarina in United States.

I did everything to negate and purify my Lower Self. I spent hours upon hours in hardcore, physical worship. But it didn't really help much in purifying the Lower Self. The ego was always bending towards negativity. The ego didn't seem to be affected by any hardcore worship. \u2063\n\u2063\n✨The moment I started to accumulate love for my Master, HDE Gohar Shahi - it was the first beam of love that crushed my ego. Nothing is more constructive in terms of cleansing and purifying the Lower Self; no worship is as effective as love is.\u2063\n\u2063\nThese were my findings.\u2063\n\u2063\n❣️💥True love will crush the idol of your ego.\u2063\n\u2063\nThis is true whether your heart is filled with true love either for God or for any human being. If you love somebody, then at least for that person, you have no ego. \u2063\n\u2063\nIf you love somebody and you still have an ego, your love is fake.\u2063\n\u2063\n💪Only love will set you free from the shackles of ego, nothing else! Not even divine energy has as much power as love does. No divine energy can do wonders like the wonders of love. Love is the best medicine.\u2063\n\u2063\n💖In love, you are humble. In love, you have no ego. Love and ego cannot coexist in one heart.\u2063\n\u2063\nThere is no greater blessing than love.

Humility and self-awareness are among the prerequisites to wisdom. \u2063\n\u2063\nAction is the final essential component of wisdom. Knowledge not acted upon is merely a collection of facts.

There is no evidence on how long the virus survives on clothes and researchers believe that the virus survives more on hard surfaces than soft surfaces such as fabric. One study states that in ideal conditions the virus can survive for up to three days on a metal\/ plastic surface and 24 hours on a cardboard surface. As for fabric, it could be similar to that of cardboard, but then there is no evidence. If you are stepping outdoors for a very short period of time and following social distancing wherever you go, then there is no real need to change your clothes when you return home. However, if you are staying out for prolonged periods of time, then it just seems like a good idea to divest yourself of the outdoors when you get home.

The next one is quite a popular workout among fitness enthusiasts, i.e. Barbell Bicep Curl, it is an upper-body muscle building workout, mainly focusses on biceps, chest, shoulders and back as well. For professionals, carrying heavyweights on both sides is good, but if you are a beginner, you should start with a barbell only and no weights at all. \n\nGet the best range of #healthsupplements on our official website: http:\/\/www.absolutenutrition.co.in\/shop\n\n#AbsoluteNutrition #MakeIndiaFit #SocialDistance #FightbackCoronavirus #AatmnirbharBharat #bodybuilding #SportsNutritionBrand #HumansOfAbsolute #gymmotivation #workoutmotivation #exercise #fitness #fitnessmotivation #getfit #lifestyle #healthy #HealthSupplements #SangramChougule","NumberOfLikes":461,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1597139399,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 11 11:49:59 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"What if i promise to stay in the woods like i was gonna do anyway?","NumberOfLikes":15,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Tag Soup on August 11, 2020.

It is not inherited. And oftentimes, greatness isn't appreciated or recognised until you see greatness anywhere no more\u2063.\n\u2063\n🤫The secret of greatness lies within you. There is no discrimination from God. Anybody can be great. You have the formula of greatness inside you. It depends on you if you want to be great. If you want to be great, you can be great.\u2063\n\u2063\nThat secret recipe of greatness is inside you. There are so many souls inside you. Nothing is out of your reach. When you reach God, you will be at the pinnacle of your journey. That is the culmination.\u2063\n\u2063\nGreatness is not inherited.\u2063\n\u2063\n👨\u200D✈️ If your father is a pilot, do you assume you will be a pilot all by yourself, without any training or education? If your father is a great batsman, do you think you'll be a great batsman without making any effort? Why then do people think that if the father is a saint of God, then the son or daughter will be a saint of God too?\u2063\n\u2063\n❤️You will be a saint of God if God wants you to be his friend. It depends on God and you. Your family is not involved; the decision is taken by God.

In total, the island nation of 5 million people has reported 22 coronavirus deaths. While other countries \u2014 including Pacific neighbor Australia and the United States \u2014 continue to battle outbreaks, New Zealand has been held up as an example of how to fight Covid-19. New Zealand's strategy was simple: in the words of Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, the country had to \"go hard, and go early.\" When Ardern closed the border to foreigners on March 19, the country only had 28 confirmed cases. And when she announced a nationwide lockdown on March 23, there were only 102 confirmed cases, and no deaths.
