[{"CaptionText":"Thinking of selling your home in the near future?\n\nGleaming appliances that work like a charm can be a huge selling point for a home on the market. \n\nBut even if your appliances leave something to be desired, replacing a whole kitchen\u2019s worth is no small purchase. A new refrigerator, range\/oven, and dishwasher could cost anywhere from $2,000 up to more than $10,000, and the average price tag for a new washer and dryer ranges from $1,100 to $2,000.\n\nDoes it make sense to invest in new appliances before putting your home on the market? \n\nWe have broken down each appliance and their lifespan, so you can invest in those appliances  that have one foot out the door, save money and give your potential buyers that extra incentive.\n\nFurnace- 15-20 years\n\nHVAC-10-15 years\n\nWater Heater- 10-15 years\n\nDishwasher- 9 Years\n\nOven-13-15 years\n\nFridge-13 years\n\nWasher & Dryer- 10-13 years\n\nWill you be replacing any appliances? share in the comments below 👇\n\n#market #update #numbersdontlie #quarantinelife #covid_19 #stayhome #staysafe #stayhealthy #socialdistancing #realtorlife #sellersagent #listingagent #buyersagent #sellingahome #buyingahome #newhome  #dreamhome #homesearch #homeforsale #homesales #lovewhatwedo #newhome #dreamhome #northdover #tomsriverlocal","NumberOfLikes":0,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by TEAM ARI Ari & Rivky Feferkorn on August 25, 2020.

Plantains have been an important staple in many tropical countries for centuries, but are not so commonly used in the US. However, they pack a ton of nutrition: they\u2019re a rich source of fiber, vitamins A, C, K and B-6, and the minerals magnesium and potassium. In particular, vitamin A, C, K & B-6 are important nutrients for our immune system. \n\nIn particular this week I want to highlight vitamin A. It is a powerful antioxidant with a critical role in enhancing immune function. This micronutrient is involved in cellular immune response and provides enhanced defense against multiple infectious diseases. Vitamin A is found in bright orange and yellow foods like plantains, sweet potato, mango, carrots, and bell peppers, and dark leafy greens like kale, spinach, and broccoli.\n\nBy consuming foods that have these nutrients every day we can better support our immune system.\n\nCheck out my Sautéed plantains with sea salt recipe this Thursday, it's a perfect side dish that can be made it just 10 min!","NumberOfLikes":3,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Jill Roberts on August 25, 2020.

O kadar çok okudum ki o eserini. Tekrar tekrar ve büyük bir heyecanla. Sonrasında bu kitabına geldi sıra. Okurken kayboldum içinde. Böyle anlatılmaz ama bu da dediğim o kadar çok yer vardı ki. Anlatmak, yazmak, betimlemek, imgelemek herkesin harcı değilmiş bunu anladım. İnsan yaşadıkça ve biriktirdikçe anlatımı zenginleşir mi bilmiyorum. Ama bir etkisi var bundan eminim. Daha güzel bir hayatı olsaydı ve o güzel hayatı böyle anlatsaydı keşke. Yaşadıkları için şu an anca üzülebiliyorum. Tesellim ise bu güzel yazıları okuyabilmiş olmak.

Some parents will be casual and encouraging. Some parents will be cautious and anxious. Both are very \u201Cnormal\u201D in this transition back to group activities.\n4. Stay close to exploring children, ready to guide, support or redirect. A great language skill is \u201Csportscasting\u201D the event \u2013 when in doubt describe what your child is doing. \u201CLook at you saying \u201Chi\u201D to your friend.\u201D Or, \u201CDo you like his tray?

Like washing your hands and staying six feet apart and wearing your mask,\" said Callie Silva.\nTheir book follows a young boy named Jax, who now has to stay home because of the coronavirus pandemic.\nAlthough he's sad, his mom explains to him that he is a superhero because he is saving lives by staying home and by incorporating other practices like washing his hands.\nEven though the Silva's do not have children of their own right now, they have many nieces and nephews. Jax's character was inspired by their nephew, Jaxon, who also lives in the San Fernando Valley area.\nThe couple said they want to further help those affected by the coronavirus by donating 10% of the proceeds.\n\"One of our goals was to be able to help our community. So, we decided to direct some of the proceeds of the sale of the book to the Mayor's Fund,\" said Leo Silva.\nCheck https:\/\/www.stayhomesuperhero.com\/ for more information, and get a copy of Stay Home Superheroes: A Kid's Guide to Social Distancing at https:\/\/amzn.to\/3grFqEU\nFont: ABC 7\n#childrensbooks #socialdistancing #losangeles #newauthors #bookrelease","NumberOfLikes":2,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598381024,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 20:43:44 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Name : [ Hydro decay series ]\nDiameter : 14.2mm\nColour : Topaz \/ marine \/ brown \/ jade\nLife span : 1-3months use\nPower available : 0-800 power (steps 50)\n\n.\n.\n\n#softlens #lensberkualiti #lensmalaysia #lenskorea #preetydolllens #lenses #lensesbychinta #lenspower #lensseremban #lensmurahseremban #lensmurahmalaysia #raya2020 #socialdistancing #covid19 #kitajagakita #kitamestimenang","NumberOfLikes":1,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by MALAYSIA 🇲🇾 LENS CANTIK on August 25, 2020.

Is there someone you can highlight in your local community? When we can shine the light on others it\u2019s a win-win. \nStay in your lane, be respectful. \nUse social media as a way to be helpful. Look for opportunities within your local community to be a helper. Real estate agents are such a huge resource to their communities, do what you can to provide helpful information to your community.\n.\n🚫Don\u2019t: Mindlessly share \u2013 think before you share. Read beyond the headline. Before you click share, watch the entire video or read the entire article and also check the resource to make sure it\u2019s coming from a reputable source. Also, be careful why funny memes\/jokes. I\u2019m not necessarily saying don\u2019t be funny, just be careful. Be mindful that a lot of people are really scared right now. Instead of sharing a meme, try turning the humor on yourself.  Lastly, don\u2019t be  unprofessional. It\u2019s okay to share your opinions, just do so respectfully and professionally. \n.\nWhat are your thoughts? Agree\/disagree?

That is why we spend SO much time during rapid recovery focusing on self care (bliss) and releasing negative mental habits, emotions, and traumas. When people do that, the nutrition pushes them to the finish line at lightening speed. \n\nThe 6 Week Rapid Recovery Group is our most popular program because the successes are so profound - people get their health back and often experience happiness on a level they never have before. It's a gift from our hearts to help people heal their spirits and their bodies and live life at such a great level in every way.\nOut Sept 18 group only has one spot as of the time I write this post. \n\nLearn more at https:\/\/goodbyelupus.com\/6-week-rapid-recovery-group\/ (or go to GoodbyeLupus.com and click \"work with Doctor G\").\n\nIf you can't join us in the group- keep up with all the free content and keep focused!

My husband was in the hospital the longest and is still dealing with issues from Covid. He had to have surgery yesterday and this weekend I felt my anxiety increasing. I was prayed up but still couldn't relax. I knew that I needed to find my happy place so that I could calm myself and be able to take care of him after surgery. Soooo I took off my muu muu house dress and put on my favorite color.... pink lipstick, pink dress and pink shoes and headed to the coast. The plan was to take a drive and maybe put my feet in the water if the beach wasn't too crowded.  Well I am happy to say that not just my feet but I was able to get in the water, it felt divine, soothing, calming, my happy place. After praying and having a self care day at my happy place, yesterday I was able to CALMLY wait with my husband in pre-op for two hours and then  CALMLY wait in the parking lot for two hours until the surgery was over. Today he is doing great and I have the strength and energy to take care of him.

Soap molecules are very similar to the ones making up the outer layer of the virus, the molecules in the outer layer are as strongly attracted to soap molecules as they are to each other. This disrupts the neatly-ordered shell around the virus, dissolving it in the running water and killing the virus.

Their current menu features dishes from as far away as Peru, Madagascar, Japan or Mexico, but welcomes some familiar Romanian surprises as well. The whole world is in front of you and acts as their menu, so get ready for some tough decisions. Will it be maki rolls with shiitake mushrooms, soy sauce, garlic and sesame seeds, a ceviche with sweet potato chips, a raw tuna in mojito, a tiramisu or any of their 9 other dishes? You can enjoy the full experience on their terrace - choosing between 2 and 5 destinations. And if you want the holiday feeling delivered home, place an order at The ARTIST Acasa\u2019s - their temporary concept, for these strange times we're living. Club Sandwich with homemade pita is a great dish to start with form their delivery menu. #maideparte\n\n📷 By @theartistrestaurant\n\n#gomio #maideparte #gaultmillau #ghidulgalben #yellowguide #stilltogether #socialdistancing #gaultmillauro  #staysafe #foodinthetimeofcorona #restaurantsofromromania #gastronomy #cuisine #contemporarydining #restaurantterraces #foodofromania #bucharest #internationalfood #theartistrestaurant","NumberOfLikes":38,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Gault&Millau Romania on August 25, 2020.

In order to resolves this issue, Humane Warriors is working closely with the Kanhewadi school team to develop a rural e-learning center and curriculum which will be serve as a model that can be replicated across rural India to provide better incentives, learning facilities and curriculum that will enable a creative learning environment. \nQuality education with digital technologies is still a privilege for most rural schools in India, and you can help us change this by visiting http:\/\/www.humanewarriors.in\/elearning-center (link in bio) and donating. \n#humanewarriors #beingawarrior #beawarrior #covid19 #coronavirus #socialdistancing #socialdistancing2020 #coronavirusoutbreak #indiafightscorona #covidrelief #fighthunger #fightcoronavirus💪 #wearamask #fundraising #fundraisingforacause #crowdfunding #crowdfundingcampaign #socialcause #educationforall #betipadhao #india #india2020 #lockdown #lockdown2020 #indiagram","NumberOfLikes":18,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598374410,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 18:53:30 CEST 2020","Location":"Pune, Maharashtra"},{"CaptionText":".\nBrand: Ecoriver\nCode: w102\nName: Karkheh (کرخه )\nPrice: 25 T\n............................................................................................................................\n✅ ویژگی: \n- قابل سفارش برای آقایان، خردسال ۳ تا ۶ سال و ۶ سال به بالا است.\n-\tماسک های دست دوز پارچه ای\n-\tدو لایه\n-\tبند قابل تنظیم\n-\tقابل شست و شو\n............................................................................................................................\n📥از طریق دایرکت ثبت سفارش نمایید.\n\n📦 ارسال محصول از طریق پست به سراسر ایران  و در خرید های بالای صد هزارتومان رایگان است.\n............................................................................................................................\n♻️محصولات اکوریور توسط زنان سرپرست خانوار تولید می شود و هدف ما حفاظت از طبیعت، اشتغال زایی برای افراد کم درآمد و ترویج زندگی سبز است.\n.\n❤ با خرید هر ماسک، اکوریور یک ماسک از طرف شما به افراد محروم هدیه می دهد. \n............................................................................................................................\nBehind every mask, there is a smile!😉\n\n#Be_Ecofriendly_safe\n\n📸 Photo: @samankind\n🎨Makeup: @dayana_grim\n💐Florist: @arena_floradesig","NumberOfLikes":7,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Ecoriver on August 25, 2020 tagging @samankind, @dayana_grim, and @arena_floraldesign.

It helps muscles to keep flexible, powerful and healthy.\n\nWhen we work out, muscles can become shortened and tight, which means they won\u2019t be at an optimal length for recovery. When a muscle is shortened and tight, it can\u2019t extend to its full length which makes them weak. Weak muscles put you at a higher risk for joint injuries and muscle strains.\n\nThe other part of the equation for stretching and why it is important is something called the \u201CLength-Tension Relationship\u201D. The Length-Tension Relationship states that muscle has an optimal resting length that can produce the greatest amount of force when contracted. When muscles are stretched to their optimal length, they can achieve maximum muscular contraction. In other words \u2026 when you stretch your tight muscles after working with weights, they will recover faster and have more strength the next time you lift.\n@paumolinac \n\n.\n.\n.\n\n#kalevfitness #kalevfitnesssolution #vanfit #vancouverfitness #gymtraining #personaltraining #groupclasses #socialdistancing #covidsafety #healthyliving #livewell #workout #personaltrainer #trainingtips #vancouverhealth #smallgrouptraining  #nutrition #tips #advice #bestversionofyou #gymmotivation #gymaddict #vanfitness #kickboxing #martialarts #conditioning #gymaccess #onlinetraining #noexcuses #workoutathome","NumberOfLikes":15,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Kalev Fitness Solution in Kalev Fitness Solution.

Otherwise every other activity we do will only see a portion of our potential. We MUST fill up our cup to pour into others'. We MUST put on our own oxygen mask before helping others with theirs. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nI realize mapping out time for this can be a challenge, and sometimes seemingly impossible. This is why I like to talk it out with a trusted friend, and brainstorm together 20 different ways to make time for myself. Usually when I'm forced to think of that many ideas, most of them are unrealistic, but maybe 2-3 are valid options. Focus on things that genuinely relax you and give you energy, not what you think you \"should\" be doing. This intention and planning up-front will blossum into a lifestyle that you not only survive, but can participate in fully. ✨⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n🌻On a completely separate note, THANK YOU everyone that came to my free #virtualclass yesterday! 🎉It felt so socially renewing to be there with you to hang out, #stretch, and focus on our energy together.

The dreaded abdominal series. 😬 And, of course, the first thing people notice when starting out with Pilates is that their neck hurts during the ab series.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nWhy? Couple of reasons. There are very few things we do in life outside of Pilates to strengthen the front of the neck. When we first start Pilates, the abdominals are weak so the neck does extra work in the curled up position. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nSingle Leg stretch. Double Leg Stretch. Scissors. Lower Lifts. Criss Cross. These are the exercises of the abdominal series.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nI have had lots of students say, \"I could do Criss Cross so much better if it was at the BEGINNING of the ab series.\" Ha! I think we can all agree to that. But doesn't this apply to anything worthwhile? Just when you are almost there. You can see the goal. You can taste it. Boom. The journey gets really hard. The road gets steeper right before it hit the precipice. But that challenge makes it all worth it in the end. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nWho's feeling like things are really hard right now?
