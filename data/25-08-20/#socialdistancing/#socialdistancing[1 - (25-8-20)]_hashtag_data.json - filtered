Health workers, essential workers, volunteers and first responders risked their lives to keep the state running, to serve us and protect us. Companies and organizations worked hard to source supply, reinvent their businesses to meet the medical demands. Our government hurriedly expanded our diagnostic capacity and contact tracing, with help from hundreds of local labs. As businesses reopen, the risk is rising again today. More than ever, New Yorkers are staying vigilant in New York City, once the epicenter of this pandemic. You can see on the streets the majority are masked up.\n \nToday, HVAC Engineer Edwin and his assistant Dorian finally came to service our air conditioners. Edwin kept his customers waiting because he has been super busy since he restarted the business after a short break. I knew him for years. I am grateful that he and Dorian donned their masks while they worked. In return, my family of three did the same. And to my delight, they were happy to pose for #masktogetheramerica.\n \nEdwin lives in New Jersey but many of his clients live in New York. Dorian is a surfer. He showed me a really cool video of him surfing. I hope his portrait will inspire other young people to keep their masks on.\n \nI am also sharing two painted windows of a bar in Chelsea. The art work echoes my deep gratitude for health workers and essential workers like them. ❤️❤️","NumberOfLikes":7,"Hashtags":["#masktogetheramerica."],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Julie Lam on July 31, 2020.

My lecture courses are completely online and remote, but some of my lab courses do meet in person, albeit with numerous precautionary measures in place: mandatory campus and building check-in and temp check each day, newly installed air filtration and disinfection units to be run overnight in each building, drastically reduced class sizes, and of course, mandatory masks and distancing throughout campus.  Crazy times.  Met my environmental science lab today, and so far the students had the proper equipment and understanding of the situation and it\u2019s precautions.  Lecturing with a mask was weird - I was able to project and breathe fine, but it makes you realize just how much the professor\/student lecture dynamic depends on me seeing their facial expressions and them seeing mine.  Just being on campus was also quiet and dystopian, with the knowledge that students were learning but not physically present - a normally packed parking lot that seemed almost abandoned, a sunny quad without students meandering trying to find where their class is, and even my office, in which I hadn\u2019t set foot in for about 6 months, seemed like a snapshot of the middle of the spring 2020 semester frozen in time before a pandemic.\n\nIt sucks, but these virtual remote classes are necessary.  Honestly, I feel lucky that I\u2019m able to at least teach a bit of my labs in-person.  Teaching online is not my cup of tea as far as preference or ability, field courses are difficult to teach in this manner as you lose my of the hands-on experience that the foundation of these courses are built on (in my opinion). And with the array of enforced policies created by the college, I do feel fairly safe being there. \n\nTeaching (and taking) online courses is a lot of work, especially to really make the course count for these students that seem to have their college experience tainted.  But hey, this is where we\u2019re at, we\u2019ll make it work, and you can bet we\u2019ll make the best of it.

Several years ago I was honored to meet an amazing woman, mentor, and friend who helped shape my life and push me towards great things. She says I inspired her to be better and make a tough life choice but really she changed me. It was through this amazing woman that I heard all about the #sunshine in her life, her sweet miracle and great niece Suzie. Suzie could instantly brighten a room with her humor and sass- we quickly became besties when I drove to Iowa to be with Ellie. Suzie, her mom, sisters, and all her other families instantly became my Iowa Family and I am so grateful for the time we got to spend together. While I know Suzie will be terribly missed here on Earth I also know her journey was complete and she has changed so many people in such a short fulfilled time. I can only imagine the trouble Suzie and Ellie are causing in heaven with their ornery sassy pants and fancy hats! Suzie- you are an inspiration to anyone that has the honor to meet you! Truly truly a loss on Earth but I\u2019m so grateful to have you watching over us right next to Ellie and all those loved ones before you! ❤️😭 I will still make it to dance marathon, I\u2019m just so sad I didn\u2019t get to experience it with you but I know you will be there with us in spirit! #lovelikesuzie #livelikesuzie #hydrocephalusawareness\n\nhttps:\/\/thesimpsonian.com\/4126\/lifestyles\/dance-marathon-family-suzies-journey\/?print=true\n\n#covid19 #socialdistancing #lockdown","NumberOfLikes":2,"Hashtags":["#Day160","#workingmomquarantinelog","#sunshine","#lovelikesuzie","#livelikesuzie","#hydrocephalusawareness","#covid19","#socialdistancing","#lockdown"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598316712,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 02:51:52 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"constancevictoria18","CaptionText":"#summernights #dtoakville #quietmoments #shoplocal #socialdistancing #silentnight","NumberOfLikes":7,"Hashtags":["#summernights","#dtoakville","#quietmoments","#shoplocal","#socialdistancing","#silentnight"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Constance Victoria in Downtown Oakville.

You\u2019ll still sweat those calories off with the added benefit of toning your body. But what is strength training, exactly? 🤔 To put it simply, strength training (a.k.a. resistance training) involves using your own bodyweight or tools, like dumbbells or resistance bands, to build muscle mass, strength, and endurance. 🏋️\nIf you\u2019re new to the weight room, getting started might seem a little intimidating, but implementing strength training into your fitness routine doesn\u2019t mean you have to completely say bye to your preferred workout. You can start by practicing resistance training just a few times a week. If you need help putting together a specific strength program for you contact us as our exercise physiologists can offer face to face or telehealth consults. 🙌 Click on the link on our bio to read about this via our facebook page.\n\n#weightloss #strength #healthylifestyle #weighttraining #strengthtraining #resistancetraining #newnormal #socialdistancing #workout #workoutplan #stayactive #fitness #fitnessmotivation #exercises #exercisemotivation #live2bewell #exercisephysiology #womenshealth","NumberOfLikes":10,"Hashtags":["#weightloss","#strength","#healthylifestyle","#weighttraining","#strengthtraining","#resistancetraining","#newnormal","#socialdistancing","#workout","#workoutplan","#stayactive","#fitness","#fitnessmotivation","#exercises","#exercisemotivation","#live2bewell","#exercisephysiology","#womenshealth"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Live 2 Be Well on August 24, 2020.

The concepts it has. Yet freedom doesn\u2019t really have a concept. It\u2019s undefinable. No matter how much we search for it. Crave it. Want to embody it. It feels like something that is so close and you can feel it in the wind, but it\u2019s colors are ever changing. I feel like the wind can teach us so much. Although it\u2019s not like water, earth, or fire in where it can hold anything, or in where it has a shape or a form, it still carries the energies and spirits of the earth and the beauty of it is that it travels absolutely everywhere and touches everything, the beauty is that it is universal and free to be what it is. I\u2019ve been thinking so much of how love travels in atoms and dust and it how flows through the air. I find so much liberty and yes, freedom, when I let myself just close my eyes and feel the wind. Let it soothe me. I feel like I\u2019m home. As if the winds are embracing me and telling me it\u2019s okay to be something that\u2019s ever flowing, ever changing. We\u2019re always constantly busy. Constantly thinking. Moving from one thing to the other. And while everyone has their things to recenter them, that brings them back to themselves, for me it is air. Air is my love. It\u2019s my freedom. And it\u2019s something no one can ever take from me, and I believe even in death my soul will at last truly be free to be infinite with the winds. I now know why I always long to be everywhere at once, and it\u2019s because air will always be the one thing that reaches and touches the whole earth, the one thing that lets us breathe life.\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n#artist #create #art  #words #writing #poet #prose #latinxpoet #latinxwriters #thoughts #air #freedom #selflove #soulsearching #spiritualjourney #divineguidance #selfworth #socialdistancing","NumberOfLikes":36,"Hashtags":["#artist","#create","#art","#words","#writing","#poet","#prose","#latinxpoet","#latinxwriters","#thoughts","#air","#freedom","#selflove","#soulsearching","#spiritualjourney","#divineguidance","#selfworth","#socialdistancing"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":9,"Timestamp":1598306454,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 00:00:54 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"zippollusa","CaptionText":"#COVID19 #DriveinMovies #SocialDistancing #Health #ZipPollUSA","NumberOfLikes":0,"Hashtags":["#COVID19","#DriveinMovies","#SocialDistancing","#Health","#ZipPollUSA"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ZIPPOLLUSA on August 24, 2020.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598306426,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 00:00:26 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"yapeims_mart","CaptionText":"ADAB KETIKA BERDOA\n\n\u201CApabila salah seorang di antara kamu bersolat, maka hendaklah dia memulai (doanya) dengan memuji Allah SWT, kemudian berselawat kepada Nabi SAW, Kemudian berdoa setelah itu dengan doa yang die kehendaki.\u201D\n\nJom beli & sumbang di 👇🏻\n\n🌐https:\/\/kyte.site\/yapeims-mart-online\n\n👍🏻 Like Facebook Yapeim SMART\n\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/koperasikhairat\/?ref=br_rs\n\nSubscribe dan Shared Youtube Channel YaPEIM'S MART\n\n🎥https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UC6L5eVfCDPU97osMnNP6OrQ \n\nFollow Instagram YaPEIM\u2019S Mart \n\n📷https:\/\/instagram.com\/yapeim_smart?igshid=1t82kidu9i5iy\n\n#yapeim #yapeimsmart #memacukejayaanbersama #ingatkebajikaningatyapeim #covid19 #stayathome #socialdistancing #MUSAADAHCOVID19","NumberOfLikes":1,"Hashtags":["#yapeim","#yapeimsmart","#memacukejayaanbersama","#ingatkebajikaningatyapeim","#covid19","#stayathome","#socialdistancing","#MUSAADAHCOVID19"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by 𝐘𝐚𝐏𝐄𝐈𝐌'𝐒 𝐌𝐀𝐑𝐓 on August 24, 2020.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598306416,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 00:00:16 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"universityatbuffalo","CaptionText":"Remember #UBuffalo! 💡 Always keep one Bronze Buffalo of space between you and your fellow Bulls! 🐃 #UBuffalo\n.\n(Yes, he's 8 feet long, but even better!)","NumberOfLikes":1231,"Hashtags":["#UBuffalo!","#UBuffalo"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by University at Buffalo on August 24, 2020.

You can however paddle in the stream here.\n \nJust a few minutes away from the play area is a café, toilets and an ice cream van. The café has a one-way system in place with indoor and outdoor seating and does lovely cakes and ice cream together with food and drinks. \n\nWe combined a picnic and play at the park, followed by a stroll down the trail past the first few waterfalls, then a return to the park for an ice cream 🍦 \n \nThis place really does have it all and comes highly recommended!

It leads through picturesque woodland and past old flour mills and industrial relics alongside a placid water stream, little waterfalls, lakes and ponds.\n \nAlong the trail you will find the remains of 20 watermills and 21 mill dams, reclaimed by nature. Along the route there are plaques and guide posts with QR codes you can scan, together with information boards dotted around.\n \nThe trail itself is about 3 miles long (or a 6-mile round trip). You can cross the river in certain parts via the stepping stones, weirs and bridges. There are benches dotted along the trail for tired legs and places to set up a picnic.\n \nYou can park alongside the road near the café \/ play area, a few miles down the road at the Rails Road parking lot, or you can pick up the trail at Malin Bridge in Hillsborough.\n \nWe\u2019ve been twice, once in Winter from Rails Road, and last week (summer) from the café, as I had the little ones on my own. The route from the café is easier and pushchair friendly (part of the way), so if you want a short walk, you can turn around when you like. The chair installation and a set of stepping stones is not far this way for a short but interesting walk.\n \nThe route from Rails Road is trickier under foot with lots of raised branch roots etc. It\u2019s much quieter this end if you prefer this. There is also a tree swing towards the Rails Road end of the trail.\n \nThe trail is so peaceful and beautiful, in all seasons, and is a lovely walk that you can make as short or long as you like. It\u2019s also a great place to take the dog. In the warmer weather, there are loads of places to paddle, or if feeling brave, its known for wild swimming. In the colder \/ wetter weather, be careful with footwear as it can really get muddy \/ slippy in places. \n\nIf anyone knows or anywhere else like this in Yorkshire (young child friendly \/ waterfalls \/ stepping stones), please let me know!\n\n#summerholidays #exploring #familytime #nature #woodland #waterfalls #placestopaddle #socialdistancing #childfriendlyyorkshire #familyyorkshire #daysoutyorkshire #placestotakethekids","NumberOfLikes":24,"Hashtags":["#summerholidays","#exploring","#familytime","#nature","#woodland","#waterfalls","#placestopaddle","#socialdistancing","#childfriendlyyorkshire","#familyyorkshire","#daysoutyorkshire","#placestotakethekids"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598303502,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 24 23:11:42 CEST 2020","Location":"Rivelin Valley Trail"},{"Owner":"pipingred","CaptionText":"oregon trail day #14: So, what\u2019s the story here? #freebra #socialdistancing #publicbathroom #oregontrail #questforgreatauntruth #southdakota #badlands #mountrushmore #montana #glaciernationalpark #yellowstone #idaho #shashonefalls #cratersofthemoon #oregon #mounthood #craterlake","NumberOfLikes":3,"Hashtags":["#14:","#freebra","#socialdistancing","#publicbathroom","#oregontrail","#questforgreatauntruth","#southdakota","#badlands","#mountrushmore","#montana","#glaciernationalpark","#yellowstone","#idaho","#shashonefalls","#cratersofthemoon","#oregon","#mounthood","#craterlake"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Erich in Gabriel Park.
