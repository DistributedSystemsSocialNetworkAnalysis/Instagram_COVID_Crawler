Especially with a young child.\n\nHe was terrified. I'm talking burst into tears the second the nurse and doctor walked into the room all covered with masks and gloves. \n\nHe screamed during the whole thing, tears streaming down his face and there was really nothing I could do. \n\nI would have given anything to take that pain for him in the moment. \n\nAnd masks make it even harder to comfort our kiddos. \n\nWe are waiting for news after the appointment and it has my stomach all in knots. \n\nParenting is tough. The worry is extreme. \n\nBut in the quiet moments when I can just hold him, everything feels pretty right in the world. So we cuddled up for his two hour nap after the appointment and I appreciated every second.\n\nThere were a million other things I could have been doing. But there was no better use of my time than holding that sweet baby❤️\n\n#worry #parentingistough #cuddles #sleepingbaby #hugs #sleepingbabyboy #mamasboy #doctor #doctorsappointment #pandemic #holdthemoments #letthembelittle","NumberOfLikes":60,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Alyssa on August 24, 2020.","NumberOfComments":33,"Timestamp":1598315956,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 02:39:16 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#painting #interior #stilllife #acrylicpainting #canvas #harvestmoon #catsofinstagram #cat #fishbowl #birdsofinstagram #birds #painter #writersinspiration #writersofinstagram #30\u201Dx40\u201Dcanvas#pandemic #artduringquarantine #artofinstagram #nancycoteart","NumberOfLikes":24,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Nancy Cote on August 24, 2020.","NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598315941,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 02:39:01 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Am I the only one who wants to eat Chane?\n#rasodemeinkontha\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nFollow @creation_of_smile for more updates .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#like #share #follow\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n@ruchahasabnis @gia_manek\n.\n#twitter #tweets\n. . . .\n#amazing #pandemic  #starplus #saathnibhanasaathiya #saathiya #kokilaben #rashi #gopibahu #cooker #kitchen #quarantine #olddays #meme #funny  #theawesomeindia #subgraphy","NumberOfLikes":34,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Creation of smile. on August 24, 2020 tagging @ruchahasabnis.","NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1598315649,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 02:34:09 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#pandemic #covid19 #covid_19 #masks #rights #humanrights","NumberOfLikes":29,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ladyliberty on August 24, 2020.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598315643,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 02:34:03 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"As we all know disasters will still occur but our training for our youth can\u2019t.

Watson\u2019s entire boyhood was spent in Chicago where he attended for eight years Horace Mann Grammar School and for two years South Shore High School. He then received a tuition scholarship to the University of Chicago, and in the summer of 1943 entered their experimental four-year college. Watson is unmarried and has no children. In 1947, he received a B.Sc. degree in Zoology During these years his boyhood interest in bird-watching had matured into a serious desire to learn genetics. This became possible when he received a Fellowship for graduate study in Zoology at Indiana University in Bloomington, where he received his Ph.D. degree in Zoology in 1950. At Indiana, he was deeply influenced both by the geneticists H. J. Muller and T. M. Sonneborn, and by S. E. Luria, the Italian-born microbiologist then on the staff of Indiana\u2019s Bacteriology Department. Watson\u2019s Ph.D. thesis, done under Luria\u2019s able guidance, was a study of the effect of hard X-rays on bacteriophage multiplication. From September 1950 to September 1951 he spent his first postdoctoral year in Copenhagen as a Merck Fellow of the National Research Council. During the spring of 1951, he went with Kalckar to the Zoological Station at Naples. There at a Symposium, late in May, he met Maurice Wilkins and saw for the first time the X-ray diffraction pattern of crystalline DNA. This greatly stimulated him to change the direction of his research toward the structural chemistry of nucleic acids and proteins...

The two Hollywood stars have answered the call. On Friday, Deadpool actor Ryan Reynolds said in a voice memo, \u201CYoung folks in B.C., they\u2019re partying which is of course dangerous. They probably don\u2019t know that thousands of young people aren\u2019t just getting sick of coronavirus, they\u2019re dying of it too.\u201D \n\nReynolds mentioned the risks of coronavirus to older people, who are more vulnerable. \u201COf course, it\u2019s terrible that it affects our most vulnerable. B.C., that\u2019s home to some of the coolest older people on earth. I mean, David Suzuki, he lives there. My mom, she doesn\u2019t want to be cooped up in her apartment all day.\u201D \n\n\u201CI hope that young people in B.C. don\u2019t kill my Mom, frankly, or David Suzuki, or each other. Let\u2019s not kill anyone, I think that\u2019s reasonable.\u201D \n\nRogen tweeted on Friday, \u201CPeople of British Columbia! Please do not go out to parties and BBQs and other large gatherings! The COVID is still out there! It\u2019s more fun to hang out alone and smoke weed and watch movies and TV shows anyway! Do that instead! Thank you!\u201D \n\nThe call for celebrities to speak out follows a surge in new coronavirus cases among young adults in B.C., Canada. Recently, the province has seen large parties that number well beyond the limit of 50 people as well as a disregard for social distancing rules. Since the end of June, the majority of new cases in the province are among the younger demographic aged 20-39. B.C. health officials are therefore attempting to use social media to send the message to younger people about coronavirus precautions, including discussing messaging strategies through TikTok and YouTubers, as well as speaking with Michael Bublé.","NumberOfLikes":55,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by No Cap News on August 24, 2020.

Conducted by Halle University, the study consisted of three pop concerts in a day, with each concert testing a different scenario. Scenario 1 simulated an event with no safety measures, Scenario 2 simulated an event with an optimized hygiene concept and greater social distancing between participants, and Scenario 3 maintained a distance of 1.5 metres between spectator stands with half the number of participants. In each concert, musician Tim Bendzko gave a concert to simulate concertgoer behaviour as realistically as possible. 1500 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 50 took part in the experiment. All were tested for COVID-19 48 hours before the experiment took place. The first results of the study are expected in the fall. \n\nParticipants were given face masks, electronic contact tracers, and fluorescent hand gel during the concert. The data from the electronic contact tracers will help scientists study contact rates and distances between participants during the concert. The hand gel will leave traces that indicate which surfaces were frequently touched. \n\nThe rationale for the study is to ascertain risk levels for major indoor events such as sports events, trade fairs, and music events that can be held, especially as more indoor events are expected to be held in the winter. Professor Michael Gekle, Dean of Medicine at The University of Halle, said to CNN, \u201CWe cannot afford another lockdown. We have to gather the data now in order to be able to make valid predictions.\u201D He also said, \u201CThere is no zero risk if you want to have life. We want to give the politicians a tool in order to decide rationally whether to allow such an event or not. That means they have to have the tool to predict how many additional infected people such an event will produce.\u201D \n\nRead the full article at www.NoCapNews.com","NumberOfLikes":65,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by No Cap News on August 24, 2020.

Feng et al. Nature Commun. 11, 4207; 2020). The researchers found that both nasal and injected forms of the vaccine protected rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) from infection. The authors say that a vaccine that can be given by nose might allow people to vaccinate themselves.\"\n\nArticle published in a journal called \"Nature\".\n\n#nurse \n#nursepractitioner \n#corona \n#COVID19 \n#Coronavirus \n#rona\n#pandemic\n#medicalnews\n#outbreak \n#vaccine\n#mompreneur \n#professionalmom \n#9tothrive\n#healthvlogger \n#healthblogger\n#advocate \n#healthadvocate \n#healthcare \n#nursingstu","NumberOfLikes":8,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Alita Carter Public Speaker📚🎙🎤 on August 24, 2020.","NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1598313151,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 01:52:31 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Ayang bundaaa lg promosiii 🤣🤣🤣🤣\n\nPromo belanja roll on ni tante\nBrli 10 gratis 2\nBrli 5 gratis 1\n\nBeli banyak lebih murah\n\nOrder: 08117555140\n\n #scionrollon #rollon #rollonnuskin #nuskin\n#lumispapromo \n#antiaging\n#antikerutan\n#atasikerutan\n#creammalam\n#creamsiang\n#pandemic\n#promo\n#musim\n#klambyloyalcustomer\n#mutiara\n#berlian\n#xuping\n#hantarannikah","NumberOfLikes":8,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598313149,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 01:52:29 CEST 2020","Location":"Pekanbaru"},{"CaptionText":"ㅤ\nBREAKING:\nA 48 hour lock down has been announced by Gaza's Ministry of Health due to the discovery of four patients with COVID-19 outside of the quarantine facilities.\nㅤ\nThe Ministry of Health:  Gaza urgently needs testing kits for Covid19 as well as other basic medical necessities due to the »Israeli« siege and ban of fuel supplies. \nㅤ\nㅤ\nㅤ\nhttps:\/\/t.co\/aGgDZrqtYx\nㅤ\nㅤ\n__\nㅤ\n=====================\nㅤ\n🇮🇩IDN :\nㅤ\n\nBREAKING:\nPenguncian pembatasan sosial 48 jam telah diumumkan oleh Kementerian Kesehatan Gaza karena ditemukannya empat pasien dengan COVID-19 di luar fasilitas karantina.\n ㅤ\nKementerian Kesehatan: Gaza sangat membutuhkan alat pengujian untuk Covid19 serta kebutuhan medis dasar lainnya karena adanya blokade »Israel« laknatullah dan larangan masuknya pasokan bahan bakar.\n ㅤ\n ㅤ\n\n__\nㅤ\nㅤ\n#No4DealOfCentury \nㅤ\nㅤ \u200F\nㅤ\n\nㅤ\nㅤ\nㅤㅤㅤ\nㅤㅤㅤ\nㅤㅤㅤ\nㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ\nㅤㅤㅤㅤ\nㅤ\nㅤ\nㅤ\nㅤ\nㅤ\nㅤ\nㅤ\nㅤㅤㅤ\nㅤㅤㅤ\nㅤ\nㅤ\nㅤ\n=======================\n#netherland #slovakia #mosque #arab #islam #muslim #indonesia #malaysia #asia #pandemic #ireland #france #japan #china #russia #turkey #BDS #Slovenia #Spain #newzealand #italy #USA #korean #europe #blm  #curfew #ICC4israel\nㅤㅤ","NumberOfLikes":5,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by tag4good_ on August 24, 2020.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598313146,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 01:52:26 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"November 2, MMXX, 2018VP1\nWater and fire.","NumberOfLikes":300,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by 𝗧𝗢𝗠𝗢𝟳𝟳 on August 24, 2020.","NumberOfComments":8,"Timestamp":1598312963,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 01:49:23 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"We couldn\u2019t be more proud to be part of @stokemuch Issue 5. 🖤\n.\nThis lead photo was taken by @franciscodphoto and starts the issue off with these words:\n.\n.\n \u201CSkateboards are for playing, but they\u2019re not toys; they\u2019re instruments, instruments of change\u201D 🙏🏿\n.\n.\nIssue 5 covers what female skaters did during this Pandemic to keep skating when the parks closed.

(KAKE) - The COVID-19 outbreak at the Sedgwick County Jail remains a problem, a problem one Wichita doctor says affects us all, which is why he\u2019s launched a one-man crusade for change.⠀\n⠀\n\u201CFairness and justice are critical principals,\u201D Dr. Daniel Warren shouted Monday morning over the lunch hour.⠀\n⠀\nHe\u2019s standing on the sidewalk outside the county courthouse, with only family members out there supporting him. He\u2019s a medical doctor on a crusade to save lives. But he\u2019s traded in his stethoscope for a megaphone.⠀\n⠀\n\u201CA restriction in freedom should not mean a restriction in health,\u201D he shouted.⠀\n⠀\nWarren is a specialist in drug and addiction problems. He says he\u2019s concerned with what he\u2019s seen some of his patients dealing with at the county jail because of the pandemic.⠀\n⠀\n\u201CI've had people that I know incarcerated for 28 days for drug violations on their probation charge, for an underlying sentence that was not violent in nature,\u201D he told KAKE News in a one-on-one interview.⠀\n⠀\n\u201CIt is not fair that people who have committed non-violent crimes, or haven\u2019t committed a crime, are exposed to a life-threatening infection,\u201D he shouted through the megaphone.⠀\n⠀\nWarren wants the county to release non-violent offenders to house arrest or on their own recognizance. He says he would expect the county to determine which prisoners are safest to be let out of jail in such a release, but that it\u2019s the best way he can see of getting the numbers of those in jail low enough to allow proper quarantining of all those who\u2019ve tested positive.⠀\n⠀\nDA Marc Bennett admits it's a tightrope - that while authorities have been trying to expedite parole violaters by speeding paperwork and reducing confinement times, more violent crimes have been happening as of late.⠀\n⠀\n\"Murders are up 50 percent from this time last year, 62 percent from the last five years and assaults are up 21 percent from last year,\" Bennett said. \"And about six percent on rapes.\"⠀\n⠀\nFor more on this story, follow the link: https:\/\/buff.ly\/3ldMCHt⠀\n⠀\n#kakenews #coronavirus #covid19 #sedgwickcounty #countyjail #pandemic #covidoutbreak","NumberOfLikes":2,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Pilar Pedraza on August 24, 2020.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598312639,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 01:43:59 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"My cute sister in law @sarahleevanleuven wanted to go get pedicures with @barbietres  and I for my birthday in March.

Eles são constituídos por uma \u201Ccapinha\u201D de proteína e às vezes de gordura que envolve sua marca específica: seu DNA 🧬 ou seu RNA. São tão primitivos que nem mesmo próprio metabolismo possuem.⠀\n⠀\n➡️ De tempos em tempos somos surpreendidos com novos supervírus, foi assim na década de 80 com a AIDS, depois veio a SARS 😷 ente 2002 e 2003, logo em seguida, 2005,  o Ébola, além de várias gripes 🤧 que tem nos afetado ao longo do tempo.⠀\n⠀\n➡️ Mas como esses vírus 🦠 chegam a esse estágio letal? Nós, humanos, somos predadores naturais. Na medida em que nós entramos em contato com animais🦒🦔 portadores destes vírus 🦠\u201Cnovos\u201D, estamos abrindo espaço para que eles adquiram a capacidade de nos invadir e nos matar.⠀\n⠀\n➡️ Os vírus 🦠 podem passar rapidamente por mutações. Mutações são mudanças na sua estrutura de DNA 🧬 ou RNA. Estas mudanças fazem com que eles rapidamente se transformem em armas letais para nós. Aí está a grande vantagem de sua estrutura e engenharia simples: mudar \u2013 ou passar por uma mutação- é muito fácil.⠀\n⠀\n➡️ E aí onde entra todo o espanto. Nós humanos temos inteligência incrível, impressionante, ao ponto de mandar humanos para outro planeta 🪐. No entanto, nossa fragilidade fica escancarada quando ficamos assombrados ante a possibilidade de morrer, atacados por um ser estruturalmente rudimentar, microscópico e invisível aos nossos olhos 👀.

How about the quality of your life? Your health? Stress levels? \n\nHas it improved your life somehow, or has the quality of your life suffered? Has it caused you to take better care of your body or pushed you off the deep end and driven you to drink more, eat more, stress more, and suffer more? Are you feeling better or feeling worse? Does your life feel like it\u2019s spiraling out of control? Is your health slipping away and your stress levels as high as they\u2019ve ever been?\nWell, if you answered yes to any of the above you\u2019re NOT alone. In fact, I think most are in the same sinking ship. Life was stressful enough before this pandemic hit, right?!\n\nJust like anything in life, we ALL have the same 24-hours in the day and the same ability to CHOOSE exactly how we want to respond to the events in our life that are out of our control. These choices and our perspective either make us or break us. There appears to be two camps. The people that Covid happened FOR and people that Covid happened TO. \nSome have used this time to take better care of their bodies, eat better, move more, and do the things they know they need to do to manage stress. Others have done the opposite. No judgement here. Just encouraging you to take a step back and reflect on the path you\u2019ve chosen. Yes, it was a choice and it\u2019s never too late to chose another response, another path, re-evaluate and pivot. \n\nThe first day of quarantine I made a conscious decision to choose to focus on what was right about quarantine\/Covid, not what was wrong. We can all agree there\u2019s a lot that\u2019s wrong, hard, scary, and stressful. But, I also realize that focusing on those things was only going to bring more of the same into my life. Where our focus goes, our energy flows, right?? \n\nThere\u2019s a lot we can\u2019t control. In fact, the only thing we can control is how we choose to respond to the events in our life. Maybe it\u2019s time to step back and ask yourself a different question.

Her current focus is on mental and physical well-being and self care. Always on one journey of self-discovery or another, Nadine hopes to share her experiences of moving from darkness to light with courage, kindness, and gratitude with those who are ready to listen and use them as a catapult for their own journeys.\u2060\n\u2060\nJoin us TUESDAY at 7am on IG live to take part in the Flow to Grow writing practice.

It did receive a limited run the week prior. This past weekend's $4 million haul brings the movie to just over $5 million, cumulatively. The numbers proved some people were ready to go back to theaters because the week-to-week bump in box office revenue amounted to a growth of 575.5-percent for the new release. While the overall number might not seem like a lot, it's actually well within range for a film of this size, that's an original IP and not based on a pre-existing franchise. This past weekend saw the first proper box office reporting since the start of the pandemic began. Over the past few months, IFC has released a slate of horror movies, which have done very well with drive-in audiences, but they also had VOD releases because indoor theaters haven't been open as widely as they are now. On top of Unhinged, less publicized movies like Words on Bathroom Walls and Cut Throat City opted to go to theaters and drive-ins and not debut with a VOD release. For its second weekend in theaters, Unhinged will have to contend with the theatrical opening of Marvel's New Mutants. The highly-anticipated comic book adaptation could pull second-week audiences away from Unhinged in favor of a slightly more family-friendly experience. Plus, the debate regarding reopoening continues to rage on. Several states are still seeing spikes in the coronavirus, causing theaters that do open to alter their day-to-day operations drastically. Solstice Studios, as a new company, needs to make a name for themselves, so they wanted to continue with their marketing strategy regarding Unhinged.\n\n#movie#boxoffice#weekend\n#results#top10#money\n#openingweekend#popcorn\n#movietheater#candy\n#newreleases#moviefood#fun#excitment\n#winners#losers#history#endgame\n#moviehistory#2020#covid19#unhinged#russellcrowe#pandemic","NumberOfLikes":13,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598302194,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 24 22:49:54 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"\u2063\nTreats go right here. \u2063\nThank you for coming \u2063\nto my TED Talk.\u2063\n~ Lašká","NumberOfLikes":133,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Elizabeth Karolina Macháčková on August 24, 2020.

What will you say or do for a 6 year old child who says she doesn\u2019t really like school work? How does your school teachers handle different learners?\n\nThe pandemic came with a lot of heart breaking events. I mean, a lot of people lost their lives to the virus. On the flip side it afforded a lot of families to stay closely knitted. Something a lot of homes have not done in a long time. What would have made the kids stopped going to school and dad and mum stay home all the time without even going to the church or mosque, it has to be something really serious, something like covid 19.\n\nOne of the things staying at home did for me was to understand my children better like I said earlier. I must say that some parents finally had an idea of what the school was teaching, how their children react to school work and their children\u2019s strength and weakness.\n\nMy husband was supervising our daughter Pemi while I worked with Nimi. He told me that Pemi said she didn\u2019t like school work. In fact she wasn\u2019t interested\u2026.i smiled because I was not surprised. Staying with her during the lock down had afforded me the opportunity to see her at play and at study regularly.\n\nWhen it comes to science experiments, my daughter is an eager and impressive student. She would ensure she performs the experiment to the latter. Oh! You can literarily see the excitement on her face and she treats it like she is doing something really important.\n\nI remember when Pemi and Nimi were watching junior church on TV, Pemi was not really paying attention until the teacher gave an assignment that involved an activity.\n\nAs soon as the class was over, she ran to the kitchen, took a cup and she proceeded to do her assignment.  The teacher had taught them about the fruits of the spirit. She asked them to write the different fruits of the spirit on a paper, colour and paste on their cups with glue.\n\nI remember another day she woke up in the morning and told everyone who cared to listen that she wanted to organise a party. She made a list of what she wanted to do.

Masks are now mandatory in Seoul. The government is also considering whether to close schools and businesses.\n\nInfectious diseases experts in the country have called on the government to step up social distancing measures even further, warning that \"hospital beds are quickly filling up and the medical system is nearing its limits\".\n\nThe Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) has admitted that about 20% of all new cases are of unknown origin - despite the country's efficient contact tracing system which can track down around 1,000 potentially infected patients in an hour.\n\nSouth Korea's fight against Covid-19 began in February after an outbreak at a Christian cult called the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in the city of Daegu, about 200km (124 miles) south of Seoul.

And I'm watching my old department lose staff left right and center. Support staff in medical research. You would think these positions are important to help solve the covid-19 pandemic, but it's clearly a non-issue to @alberta_ucp . \n.\n.\n.\nI worked my ass off to build myself a career in a competitive work field in animal care but this chapter has come to an end. It's a field where mental health is overlooked when staff deal with major health issues and death on the daily. Yet we still get blasted for being animal murderers or 'doing it for the money.' To my friends still in animal care, I commend your strength but I'm out ✌️.\n.\n.\n.\nI'm not sure where my career will take me next, but I have a fire under my ass to dig into a new field. A fire that burns HOT for being laid off while on sick leave. Did I get let go because I'm prioritizing my own health or because I'm the only non pretty girl working under a straight male department head? Maybe. Sketchy, yes, but it's clear my employer doesn't care about my well-being. \n.\n.\n.\nPeace out animal care, I'll miss you.

We all know that. Nurturing love, whether with yourself, with whom you live or with your partner, is so important during stressful times like these.\nFor many folks, that transition from initial infatuation and sexual fantasy to more routine dating (or quarantining together) can come with a sudden decrease in sexual frequency. It\u2019s almost like you\u2019ve asserted that you\u2019ve chosen one another, so that psychological edge of uncertainty is home. You\u2019re falling into a routine\nSex can be a critical bonding experience for some partners, but it\u2019s not a priority for every relationship. Of course, when the physical intimacy isn\u2019t at 100% in your relationship, it\u2019s a good idea to do your darndest to make sure emotional intimacy is. Getting emotionally intimate together could be sex-related like watching, listening to, or reading about erotic situations as a couple, or it could be as simple as learning your partner\u2019s love language and making sure they\u2019re satisfied in that area. \n#stress #quarantine #quarantinesex #corona #covid19 #pandemic #nurturelove #love #sexesteem #sexpositive #sextherapy #sex #sexedu #sexeducation #sexed #selfcare #selflove #radicalselflove #radicallove #sextherapist #sexualeducation #sextoys #loveandsex","NumberOfLikes":6,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Sari Cooper on August 24, 2020.

But NO MORE KIDS PLS. \nImagine this: Instead of giving poor people (and non-poor people) more money the more kids they have (which encourages poor people - and everyone - to have unprotected straight sex = more babies), what if poor people (and within reason everyone else) got money\/ support \/ benefits\/ food \/ healthcare\/ rent assistance (ie basic needs met) for NOT having kids (and not making an already suffering planet and economy worse)? \nI wouldn\u2019t have to worry about being homeless, even though I\u2019m childless! What a dream. Poor people (and everyone else) would have to put all their love, money, focus, and time into 2 kids only (or no kids!). The world would be a better place, full of happier adults, and happier children; that\u2019s for sure. We\u2019d even overcome a pandemic like Corona easier. This behavior is insane, and I guess it takes a \u201Ccrazy\u201D person to see it and say it.\nIf you know someone in power (influence, money, politics), please pass on. Namaste, bitches. I love you 🤍\nP.S. People would say Congratulations! on social media when friends had a sterilization surgery. \nMen would stop feeling \u201Caccomplished\u201D and \u201Cproud\u201D to have made a woman pregnant. If a rapist can be a \u201Cdad\u201D, or a drunk teen; don\u2019t you get it? NO ONE IS IMPRESSED. The physical torture the women put themselves through though, that is fucking impressive. But my utopia is even better. Bonus: Less abortions, less foster kids, less abused kids (hopefully), less starving kids, less neglected kids, less teen pregnancies, less babies born addicted to drugs, less crushed female dreams and careers. And you know what that all means? Less fucked up adults and pain in general. Amen! \nVisit your local Planned Parenthood clinic or Family Planning aisle at HEB today.","NumberOfLikes":5,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ℌ𝔞𝔩𝔩𝔬𝔴𝔢𝔢𝔫 𝔅𝔞𝔯𝔟𝔦𝔢 on August 24, 2020.","NumberOfComments":13,"Timestamp":1598293445,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 24 20:24:05 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Gameplay walkthrough part 22","NumberOfLikes":2,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598256449,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 24 10:07:29 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Source: Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman #thenexteconomymustbefair #tnembf #inequality #oligarchy #taxtherich #healthcareisahumanright #economicjustice #billionairesarelooters #essentialworkers #generalstrike #generalstrike2020 #rentstrike #cancelrent #cancelrentnow #suspendrent #noworknorent #rentsuspension #pandemic #desigualdade #oligarquia #inégalité #oligarchie #oligarquía #desigualdad","NumberOfLikes":28,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The Next Economy Must Be Fair on August 24, 2020.

It has been tried since early in the year in China, the Netherlands, and also in the US, where more than 70,000 patients have received it already as part of studies or under case-by-case medical exemptions, according to the US Food and Drug Administration. However, some doctors have criticized how the treatment has been handled in the US. Because doctors have been allowed to give plasma to tens of thousands of patients outside of trials, they say, it\u2019s been difficult to gather decisive evidence on the effects. \n\nThe approval of the use of plasma also comes days after President Trump took to Twitter to accuse the FDA and the \u201Cdeep state, or whoever\u201D of slow-walking cures in order to interfere with his chances in the November general election.\n\nThe plasma approval could foreshadow US government actions around a vaccine for covid-19, some scientists fear. The chief doctor coordinating vaccine studies in the US has said data supporting a vaccine won\u2019t be in hand until January at the earliest, but the Financial Times reported that the administration is looking to fast-track an emergency approval of a vaccine before Election Day.  If an unsafe or ineffective vaccine goes into wide use, that will be a bigger setback than we\u2019ll suffer if convalescent plasma proves a dud. That is because plasma is given to people who are already sick, while vaccines are given to healthy people. Click the link in our bio to learn more.

Aidan (Tyler Posey) wakes up to find himself trapped in his apartment, totally cut off the outside world and unable to reach his loved ones with infected people everywhere in his building.

In hindsight, never having spent longer than three weeks together and moving 150 miles from most people we knew really could\u2019ve gone terribly. \nMost couples don\u2019t run a business together and have separate jobs and workplaces to go to for 8\/9 hours a day, we don\u2019t have that. It\u2019s just us (plus the fluffies and Scott\u2019s Nan, Marie), all day, everyday. Luckily it turns out that we really like spending ALL THE TIME together! And we now have the office space for when one of us (ie. me) needs to concentrate and get out of the house.\nWe\u2019re coming up to a year in Weston and what a year it\u2019s been: a Green Business award, finding @thestableweston, making some friends, investing in ourselves, that whole pandemic thing that took over the world and it\u2019s only August!

Monday is finally done and dusted. Luckily for me I have a full week off of work plus bank holiday so I am relaxing and reading. Today I went swimming for the first time and was seriously impressed with all the precautions they took. It made me feel very safe! It was so lovely to get out and stretch my body and discover that I\u2019m actually still quite fit 😂 despite not having swam in a year. Lockdown made me move my body more and so I\u2019m putting it down to that. \u2063\n\u2063\nThis book was a YouTube recommendation but I can\u2019t remember who from. But... I am shocked at how absolutely incredible this book was. I loved it. The prose was insane and it was insightful and it was painful. If this one sounds like it might be up your street then it probably is one for your favourites shelf. It is worth the hype. \u2063\n\u2063\nThis story follows various characters in Santa Lora, America, in their fight for survival against a sleeping disease that sets out a pandemic across the town. The roads are sealed and the shops become barren. Dogs start to wonder the streets, families become split apart and black \u2018X\u2019s\u2019 are sprayed upon the doors of those affected. People are falling asleep and they are not waking up. Sometimes for months. Why is this happening? When will it end? How is it spreading? This book explores the very thing that keeps humanity ticking and yet exposes the very thing we all want to hide, our dreams. Not the kind that we wistfully think about, but the terrifying. \u2063\n\u2063\nMy favourite quote: \u2063 \u201CThis is how the sickness travels best: through all the same channels as do fondness and friendship and love.\u201D\n\u2063\nI was absolutely astounded by the writing and the story plot. I couldn\u2019t guess what was going to happen and yet all of it felt real, especially in our current time. This one was a 5 stars for me, no question, and I have already borrowed Karen Thompson Walker\u2019s other novel The Age of Miracles.\u2063\n\u2063\n#thedreamers #karenwalkerthompson #libbyapp #libraryread #ebook #ebookstagram #ebookreader #reading #pandemic","NumberOfLikes":14,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Emsal Arslan in Kent, United Kingdom.

It\u2019s easy to say, \u2018I can totally defend how there can be a good God and innocent people dying,\u2019 but then when you actually start suffering, you have to reevaluate that argument while feeling the hurt instead of just thinking about the hurt. \n\nGoing through a difficult situation can ultimately strengthen your faith because it makes you believe that thing that you said you did. It puts your purely intellectual beliefs to the test and, if you have faith, can help cement those beliefs in your heart. It\u2019s not effortless or simple, but in Christianity, the most important idea is that you can always turn to God in your hardship if you trust in him.\u201D","NumberOfLikes":55,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Lindsay Athena Wang on August 24, 2020 tagging @adultish.cambino.

For almost 3 decades I have listened to this album in the short period between Summer and Fall.  When I was younger, it was one that signaled a return to school.  Now it feels like the transition of warm days to cooler mornings.  The song Black Metallic was the first one of theirs that  caught my ear.  It\u2019s still probably their most solid track to date, but their whole catalogue is just phenomenal. \n\n-\n\nCatherine Wheel were the black sheep of the shoegaze family. They came from Great Yarmouth, a depressed and depressing town on the English coast with little in the way of musical heritage; their lead singer, Rob Dickinson, was a cousin to Iron Maiden\u2019s Bruce Dickinson; and their four members seemed slightly older than their peers, with drummer Neil Sims having worked on an oil rig before the band took off. Musically, too, Catherine Wheel were different: While they embraced the swirling, distorted guitars and muttered vocals of shoegaze, their sound edged towards straight-up riff-rock at times, with nothing of My Bloody Valentine\u2019s deviant experimentalism or Slowdive\u2019s feathery beauty. What Catherine Wheel did have in abundance were goosebump-raising, brilliant songs that piled earworm choruses upon nagging guitar lines and lyrics that spoke to a generation of awkward adolescents (\u201CI Want to Touch You,\u201D \u201CShe\u2019s My Friend,\u201D \u201CShallow\u201D). A good half of the songs on Ferment, their debut, are enduring shoegaze-disco classics, while \u201CBlack Metallic,\u201D in its full seven-minute glory, makes a strong claim to being the genre\u2019s \u201CStairway to Heaven.\u201D \u2013Ben Cardew- Pitchfork - A score of 23 of the 50 best Shoegaze albums of all time \n\n#CatherineWheel #Ferment #shoegaze #vinyl #vinyllove #vinylporn #vinyllover #vinylrecord #vinylcollection #vinyljunkie #vinylrecords #vinyladdict #vinylcollector #vinylcommunity #vinylcollectionpost #love #quarantine #pandemic #music #vinylcollector","NumberOfLikes":34,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1598287077,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 24 18:37:57 CEST 2020","Location":"Mesta Park"},{"CaptionText":"Protect Farmworkers ✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾\n.\n.\n.\nIn Fires, In Storms, In Heatwaves, And In A Pandemic Thousands Of Men And Women Continue To Work To Keep Food On Our Tables. #farmworkersfeedtheworld \n.\n.\n.\nEssential Workers Deserve Hazard Pay!

It's good for brain development, social skills, creativity, language skills and so much more. But, I think that's also beneficial for us parents.\n\nThere are a few things I've realised about the times when I've stopped and took the time to actively play. The benefits I've experienced include:\n\n\u2022 Reduced stress levels. Working from home can be really stressful at times and it's generally when I'm busy that the kids will start asking and nagging me to play with them. And I've found that if I even just take 5 minutes out to play I get back to working feeling a lot less stressed.\n\n\u2022 I laugh more. I'm not sure about you but for some reason we always end up laughing lots when we start playing and laughing is definitely good for the soul. \n\n\u2022 Play also allows me a chance to see the world through their eyes. Whether it is through dress up, story telling or their favorite game, mummy and baby, I've learnt a lot about how they view the world in these times we play together. \n\n\u2022 I get lots of extra hugs. I become the favorite parent even if it's just for that day. But after we spend some time playing I get loads of hugs. \n\n\u2022 Sometimes it's just a little reminder that there are other important things in the world and that you have to take time to be silly and to play. \n\nBy the way I think I fit right into the ball pool, don't  you? \n @mommyingabout the proof is in the pudding\/ pool. 🤣","NumberOfLikes":34,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by toomuchofakidthing on August 24, 2020.

Quando os pais devem se preocupar?\n\nVamos pensar sobre a fase da adolescência.\n\nNão existe uma data definida para determinar quando acontece a adolescência. De acordo com a OMS (Organização Mundial de Saúde), essa fase acontece entre os 10 e 24 anos de idade e é divida em pré-adolescência, adolescência e juventude. \n\nA adolescência não dura para sempre, mas é um longo período de alterações hormonais e de identidade, quando o jovem passa por um processo de desligamento do seu eu infantil e passa a descobrir quem ele realmente é ou quem quer ser.\n\nPorque é tão bom ficar no seu canto sozinho?\n\nQuando o adolescente se tranca no quarto ele esta construindo essa nova identidade. No seu espaço ele pode se expressar com toda a liberdade, ele usufrui de sua necessidade de intimidade, ele redescobre o seu corpo com todas as modificações, nessa fase ele tem o seu despertar sexual, ele tem mais sono, ele sente necessidade de privacidade.\n\nMas o que diferencia um isolamento normal, de um que parece ser um problema? \n\nSe mesmo antes do isolamento social, provocado pela epidemia do coronavírus, alguns adolescentes passaram a se \u201Cfechar\u201D, agora longe de tudo e todos, é preciso que os pais e responsáveis fiquem mais atentos às mudanças comportamentais. Isso porque, ainda não se sabe ao certo o quanto esse afastamento \u201Cbrusco\u201D pode prejudicá-los.\n\n\u201CO adolescente é uma pessoa normalmente informada, com maravilhosas capacidades e habilidades. É uma geração melhorada que precisa de segurança e afeto das pessoas significativas, como pais, tios, avós, e do mundo\u201D, destaca o psicoterapeuta Neido Castilho Júnior.\n\nAlém disso, é necessário que haja entre os pais e adolescentes, \u201Cuma comunicação não violenta, horizontalizada, momento quando se permite o desabafo ou expressão de sentimentos e opiniões\u201D.\n\n#adolescencia #vinculo #familia #paisefilhos #comunicação #mediação #educacao #desafio #adolescents #adolescentes #psicoterapeuta #psicología #psychologist #mentalhealth #saúdemental #isolamento #segundafeira #pandemic #psis #boasemana","NumberOfLikes":11,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598281976,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 24 17:12:56 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"High Society Man...\n\nHas you in the palm of his hand\nHe knows you long to free\nHe makes enemies of you and me\nHe's a high society man\nYou know he's got blood on his hands...\n\n#songwriter #ascap #tunecore #spotify #hidingbehindblueskies #election2020 #pandemic\n#music #rockmusic","NumberOfLikes":7,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598281557,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 24 17:05:57 CEST 2020","Location":"North Little Rock, Arkansas"},{"CaptionText":"If you or someone you know, has a business, daycare, school, restaurant, church, gym, car dealership, or practically any public place that\u2019s open to the public, and want to best insure the safety of you, your staff and your customers, by making sure you have a Covid19 (CoronaVirus)!free space. \n\nContact #HazmatProsFL at  www.WeRemoveCovid.com \n\nYou can see rates, schedule your desired service right from the website. \n\nTechnicians avaible to service, \nJacksonville and North Florida \nOrlando and Central Florida \nWestPalmBeach and Central South Florida \nFortLauderdale  and South Florida \nTampa and South West Florida\n\nThe EPA and NSF approved disinfectants used by Hazmat Pro\u2019s are non toxic, food surface safe, and approve for both Hard and Soft surface removal of #SARSCoV2, #Mold and other #Viruses 🦠, Bacteria, and Parasites!!!! \n\nHazmat Pro\u2019s is Licensed, Bonded and Insured\n\nSo reduce your liability by hiring a professional.\n\nVisit our website: www.weremovecovid.com\n\nCall us toll-free: 1-844-8HAZMAT or 1-844-842-9628\n\n#HazmatPros #WeRemoveCovid #Florida #Covid19 #Coronavirus #StaySafe #Covid_19 #Covid #Service #Floridalife #Corporate #Pandemic #Residential #Services #StaySafeStayHome #StaySafeEveryone #Pandemic2020 #PalmBeachCounty #PBC #Hazmat #StaySafeOutThere #StaySafeAtHome #StaySafeAndHealthy","NumberOfLikes":8,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598283327,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 24 17:35:27 CEST 2020","Location":"Florida"},{"CaptionText":"We are happy you are loving your Carnival Care packages made by us. \nYour creativity has definitely put a smile on our faces. ✨✨✨✨ Thank you for sharing this with us.
