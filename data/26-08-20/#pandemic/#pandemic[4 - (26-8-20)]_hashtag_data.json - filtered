Everyone is in need of support, both socially and fiscally. Unfortunately, we are having to completely rewire the way we offer and receive support during this pandemic. No more happy hour fundraisers or extravagant galas. This is the era of learning how to engage donors virtually. It feels like everything is on pause but political fundraising cannot stop. \u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nHere are 5 ways your political organization can raise money in the midst of a global pandemic. \u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\n 1) Live Stream a Pajama Ball or Virtual Gala\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nWith a little creative use of Social Media capabilities, you have the ability to live to stream your event to your audience or \u201Cattendees\u201D. You can incorporate Q&A sessions so that attendees can participate from the comfort and safety of their own home- as dressed up or dressed down as they wish.\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\n2) Host a Webinar\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nInvite your supporters to a virtual town hall or webinar, where they can view live sessions with the CEO and Board. They can participate in live interviews with the rest of your team, and learn about the present, past, and future initiatives and projects\u2063\u2063.\n\u2063\u2063\n3) Plan a Virtual Race\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nDon\u2019t cancel that 5k you had planned! Encourage your community to run outside in their community or on a treadmill by hosting a virtual fun run. Ideally, participants will sign up, pay a registration fee, and set up a date and time for the virtual race. You can keep track of participant\u2019s times and announce the winners on a live stream or webinar.\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\n4) Host an Online Auction\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nHosting a virtual auction can be easier than setting one up in person. Set up a page where all your items can be viewed and bid on, you can announce the winners on a live stream or virtual gala.\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\n5) Plan a Virtual Happy Hour\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nWe could use all use a happy hour to ease the stress of a global pandemic, and it is more important now than ever to build and maintain positive relationships between donors and organizations.

Moving along, chugging along, riding the bumps and turns, at the end of the day sleep overtaking the exhaustion of living in these times.\n\nSometimes we all live our lives in a small bubble, I do too. Everything outside is abstract, and not real, we do not understand it completely. While that bubble might mask us all from the worries outside or right now the raging pandemic gripping this world, it actually hurts the most when the bubble bursts and everything hits home and brings a cloud of anxiety and confusion.\n\nSo I urge you all, to take this seriously(if you are not). Pandemic isn't over yet, far from it. It's high time for all who are carelessly or unknowingly ignoring this to WAKE UP.\n\nEverything pushes me down these days, and it's fine. But just like everyday, you show up, make the best of what you can. Like this weekend, we went for a short hike with the boys and the weather was just perfect. While they explored the woods, we awed in their little joys, super proud of how much they are growing and learning every single day, despite being home.\n\nYes life keeps going, pandemic or not.  We have a busy week ahead with lots of stuff planned before the school starts in September. Never did I imagine that my little boy will start his first school year like this, but it is what it is.\n\nWhat are your plans before schools start? How are you feeling about it all?\n\nHave a great week everyone.\n\n#Mondays #mondaymotivation #pandemictimes #pandemic #covid19 #school #kindergarten #firstyearofschool\n#foodblogger #momblogger #browngirlwrites #brownmoms #boymama #parentinginapandemic #parenting #motherhood #hiking #weekendplans #hikingwithmyboys","NumberOfLikes":117,"Hashtags":["#Mondays","#mondaymotivation","#pandemictimes","#pandemic","#covid19","#school","#kindergarten","#firstyearofschool","#foodblogger","#momblogger","#browngirlwrites","#brownmoms","#boymama","#parentinginapandemic","#parenting","#motherhood","#hiking","#weekendplans","#hikingwithmyboys"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Pankti | food & motherhood on August 24, 2020.

Henry McMaster prepared to announce the end of a coronavirus stay-at-home order, his top staff received an email from the state health department.\nThe message, highlighted in bold, was clear: Wait longer before allowing customers back inside restaurants, hair salons and other businesses where people will be in close contact.\nInstead, McMaster pressed ahead with a plan written by the state restaurant association to resume inside dining on May 11. The guidelines made masks optional for employees and allowed more customers inside than the health agency had advised.\n...\nHe was hardly alone. Thousands of pages of emails provided to The Associated Press under open-records laws show that governors across the U.S. were inundated with reopening advice from a wide range of industries \u2014 from campgrounds in New Hampshire to car washes in Washington. Some governors put economic interests ahead of public health guidance, and certain businesses were allowed to write the rules that would govern their own operations.\n.\nFULL STORY:\nhttps:\/\/bit.ly\/3hCLCdT\n.\n#maskcapecod #MaskUpMA #wearamask please, because #covid19 #coronavirus","NumberOfLikes":1,"Hashtags":["#pandemic.","#maskcapecod","#MaskUpMA","#wearamask","#covid19","#coronavirus"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @maskcapecod on August 24, 2020.

The flurry of voice and video may be initially hard to follow, but as the dialogue develops, a clearer picture of the narrator\u2019s journey through illness and recovery emerges. \u2063\n\u2063\nTo watch the full work, click the link in our profile.\u2063\n\u2063\nJohn Muse\u2019s 𝘋𝘶𝘦𝘵 is the fifth of Open Video Call 2020\u2019s ongoing weekly premieres. Through September 16, new works will be featured on ICA\u2019s website every Monday at noon, followed by a live interview and Q&A session on Wednesdays at 6PM between the filmmakers and this year\u2019s curators, local media arts collective Lino Kino (@linokinovideo). This Wednesday\u2019s conversation will also feature John Muse\u2019s collaborator on 𝘋𝘶𝘦𝘵, Mason Rosenthal.

Can\u2019t quite put your finger on what might be contributing to it?  You might be experiencing something called Crisis Fatigue.⠀\n.⠀\n🌿 This occurs when stress from one or more crisis or threat is unrelenting and chronic. And 2020 has been a challenging and stressful year for many of us:  a global pandemic, socio-political protests and upheaval, traumatic world events, financial crisis, political disruption....all layered with our individual life stressors....it\u2019s A LOT. Too much, even.⠀\n.⠀\n🌿Stress accumulates.  And our bodies and minds aren\u2019t designed to withstand unrelenting stress.  It depletes our resources and resilience and takes a toll on our physical and emotional health. This is where we can experience Crisis Fatigue.⠀\n.⠀\n🌿So if you\u2019re feeling unmotivated, exhausted, numb, or overwhelmed please know that it\u2019s ok.

You\u2019re literally trying to process an incredible amount of stress, crisis, and in many cases trauma.⠀\n.⠀\n🌿 Look after yourself.  Do what feels right for you.  And if you\u2019re feeling burned out, return to the self-care basics and build up from there.  Drink enough water. Eat regularly. Talk about your feelings. Breathe.

It\u2019s only when the horror stories of the disease started coming in that I steadily grew more anxious. That coupled with the new knowledge that this wasn\u2019t something that was going to blow over anytime soon made me feel even worse.\n\nI am a vocal mental health ally, so it wasn\u2019t difficult for me to pause and acknowledge my own feelings. I believe in the power of authentic conversation so whether it is my blog or my podcast, you\u2019ll find me discussing all these things very openly.\n\nI found that our collective mental health as a country took a terrible turn for the worse when we heard of the untimely and very sad demise of Sushant Singh Rajput. At that point I felt that suddenly there was a lot of chatter on social media about mental health that didn\u2019t necessarily include verified facts.\n\nAs a writer and responsible content creator, I thought about how I could help. That\u2019s when I tied up with a team of psychologists to create simple, succinct, and easy to understand content around mental health.I feel like it was the need of the hour.\n\nThe posts I create are branded \u2018Real Talk\u2019 and they tackle one difficult topic at a time, \u2018How To Decide If It\u2019s Time To Get Therapy\u2019, \u2018How To Deal With Feelings Of Hopelessness\u2019, etc. It\u2019s been extremely heartening to see people really keen to share these posts as I guess everyone is looking for reliable sources on important conversations. Meanwhile on my podcast 'Real Talk With Smriti Notani' there have been fun episodes on \u2018Tips For Couples In Lockdown\u2019 and \u2018100 Awesome Things To Do During Quarantine\u2019. \"\n\n💛 Continued in comments 💛","NumberOfLikes":314,"Hashtags":["#PlixxoUpCloseAndPersonal,","#PlixxoInfluencer"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":6,"Timestamp":1598269615,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 24 13:46:55 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"\u2063\nTHE SHOW MUST GO ON...... \u2063\n\u2063\nJust because we\u2019re going through a pandemic doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s all over.... there are so many things to be grateful for, and so many things that can fill your life with joy... don\u2019t forget about the little things. \u2063\n\u2063\nI AM ABUNDANT ✨ \u2063\n\u2063\nvia @georgiameretta \u2063","NumberOfLikes":66,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ALICE ONS | BUSINESS MENTOR ✨ in Byron Bay, New South Wales.

We need to allay the possibility of a \u201Ctwindemic,\u201D the overlap of #fluseason and an expected surge in COVID-19 cases this fall and winter. #covid19 #covid #flushot #prevent #immune #contagious #doctor #physician #nurse #hospital https:\/\/www.google.com\/amp\/s\/pressofatlanticcity.com\/news\/now-is-the-time-to-defend-against-influenza-get-a-flu-shot-dr-nina-radcliff\/article_fa87c715-5250-5c1a-af3b-2a010a096035.amp.html","NumberOfLikes":563,"Hashtags":["#weekly","#nationally","#syndicated","#column","#influenza","#flu","#health","#experts","#country","#stress","#vaccination","#fall","#emergencyrooms","#urgent","#clinics","#challenged","#pandemic","#healthcare","#visits","#fluseason","#covid19","#covid","#flushot","#prevent","#immune","#contagious","#doctor","#physician","#nurse","#hospital"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Nina Radcliff on August 24, 2020.

When you lack in Vitamin D, your skin becomes easily inflammable leading to pimples, acne flares, brittle nails, hair fall, dirty skin, irritation, sleep and mental disturbances, etc. Skin conditions like psoriasis can also increase if your body doesn\u2019t get adequate vitamin D.\n\nToday, Dr Rahul Shetty enlightens us with how to take care of skin while you stay indoors!

Be it at home, outside, anywhere. As vectors of deadly diseases in times like this as well they are lurking.\n\nThis post is to remind ourselves to not drop guard - Mosquitoes are one of the deadliest animals in the world. Their ability to carry and spread disease to humans causes millions of deaths every year. In 2015 malaria alone caused 438 000 deaths. The worldwide incidence of dengue has risen 30-fold in the past 30 years, and more countries are reporting their first outbreaks of the disease. Zika, dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever are all transmitted to humans by the Aedes aegypti mosquito.

How? Swipe to find it. \n\nGimana HoReCa di Belanda mencoba survive di masa pandemi ini? Protokol Corona wajib dijalankan. Aku coba share disini ya, kalo soal jaga jarak dan pake masker itu udah dibahas kemarin-kemarin tapi sekarang how to track & trace itu ternyata perlu cara juga, walau ada yang tetap drama & baper. Ada beberapa orang menentang protokol corona dengan alasan melanggar hak privasi dan hak asasi. Sejauh ini disalurkan dengan petisi, demo dan maju ke pengadilan. Anyway, just want to share this. Something to remember & learn. Pretty simple in my opinion. \n\nPertama: hampir di semua lokasi mengaplikasikan rute 1 arah untuk menghindari orang selisipan. \n\nKedua: diberi sekat-sekat barang atau plastik. \n\nKetiga: Ini yang menarik, semua tamu diwajibkan mengisi formulir data yang berisi check list: nama, kontak, tamu di tgl\/jam berapa & duduk di dalam\/luar. Ini cool menurut aku. \n\nTerakhir: Formulir diberikan ke pramusaji\/karyawan & Enjoy your meal! 💕 \n\nSolusi cukup adil untuk mendata manual siapa saja & ada dimana saja untuk kepentingan bersama.\n\nTambahan: sistem ini melengkapi app yang sedang diuji coba pemerintah untuk alert system track and trace ini. (ada di 2 slide terakhir).\n\nCovid 19 ini juga berevolusi memberi tantangan bertahan dan ternyata juga menimbulkan banyak stigma bagi yang terpapar & lingkungan. \n\nKebutuhan Nongkrong-Konten vs Kesehatan Publik. \n\nKetersediaan Kamar Hotel vs Ketersediaan Kamar di RS.\n\nMembantu Ekonomi vs Membantu Kesehatan \n\nJaga Imun. Jaga Iman. \n\nPanjang ya ceritanya karena ketika di Indonesia sedang menuju puncak kurva gelombang pertama, di Belanda menuju puncak gelombang kedua. \n\nMencoba Stay Safe & Solidarity.

As per the recent reports, China has claimed the Pamir region of Tajikistan that accounts for 45 per cent of Tajik territory. In line with its modus operandi to stake a claim on foreign territories, Beijing has started with historical revisionism.\nAs a matter of fact, Central Asia is a region of Chinese influence. But, the latest bid to claim almost half of Tajikistan might end up antagonising Central Asia against China. Moreover, the Sino-Russian \u201Caxis of convenience\u201D is again being put to test with the latest round of Chinese expansionism.\nRecently, official Chinese outlets relentlessly republished an article written by a Chinese historian, Cho Yao Lu, several times. The provocative article titled \u201CTajikistan Initiated the Transfer to China of Its Land and the Lost Mountains of the Pamir Were Returned to Their True Master.\u201D This article claims that the entire Pamir region was once part of China, but it lost these territories in the 19th century due to pressure from the UK and Russia.\n\nYao Lu also states that China was able to reclaim a part of the Pamir region in 2010. He is here referring to a 2011 deal wherein a debt-ridden Tajikistan had to lose 1,158 square kilometres of its \u2018disputed\u2019 territory to China. Beijing had then persuaded a debt-trapped Dushanbe, to cede a part of its territory. Now, China wants to use its infamous debt-trap diplomacy to usurp almost half of the landlocked country.\n\n#hongkong #zoom #virus #blacklivesmatter #belarus #pandemic #protest #beach #socialdistancing #wtfmemes #lockdown #christian #tiktok #cat #corruption #covid19 # #propaganda #evangelical #obama #socialmedia #bailout #quarantine #trump #blm #pandemic #stimulus #testing #stayhome #trump2020 #bhfyp #election2020","NumberOfLikes":4,"Hashtags":["#hongkong","#zoom","#virus","#blacklivesmatter","#belarus","#pandemic","#protest","#beach","#socialdistancing","#wtfmemes","#lockdown","#christian","#tiktok","#cat","#corruption","#covid19","#propaganda","#evangelical","#obama","#socialmedia","#bailout","#quarantine","#trump","#blm","#pandemic","#stimulus","#testing","#stayhome","#trump2020","#bhfyp","#election2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Bastian - Hidden Figure 🚶 on August 23, 2020.

Elissa gave us a little insight into her experiences working with our most vulnerable community members and we wanted to share her story with you.\n⠀\n\u201CWhen we started caring for aged care residents on our ward I went to my Grandmother\u2019s house and she gave me a whole pile of Greek magazines that I could give to our Greek residents to have something to read. I then went out and purchased some reading glasses for Panagiota as she didn\u2019t have any and wasn\u2019t able to read. There is another lady as well who is Greek and she unfortunately arrived to us without her glasses from her aged care home, so I gave them a call and asked them to send them to us. Which we received and she was very happy.\n⠀\nThe patients really enjoyed the magazines, so when I went to go pick up the Greek newspaper (@Neos_Kosmos) for my grandma I decided to get some for the Greek patients on our ward at the same time. I had a conversation with my Dad and we talked about trying to get the paper sent to the hospital for them for free. Dad called the paper and arranged for 10 newspapers to be donated each day they are published. They now get delivered to the hospital and we distribute them to our Greek patients. The content is just like the herald sun and it\u2019s the most popular Greek newspaper in Australia.\n⠀\nI find that when I have spare time I go and have a chat with my Greek patients. I like being someone who they can talk to and we chat about all sorts of things. Panagiota is just beautiful she reminds me so much of my grandmother. She\u2019s kind, caring and a bit cheeky.\n⠀\nGoing into working on this ward I was a bit scared of what it would be like but I have absolutely learnt to love it. I love going in and working with a great team of nurses that have come from all departments across SVPHM and I really look forward to going into see my Greek patients in the morning. Every day I walk into Panagiota\u2019s room and say Kalimera which means good morning. And she responds with Agapi mou, which means my love.

The reason, he explains, is pretty simple: blood samples are much easier to obtain than lymphatic ones.\n\nIt usually takes years for tumours to spread to distant sites in the body, or metastasise, mainly because most of the cells die while they\u2019re migrating through the blood. In previous work, Morrison and his team suggested that oxidative stress, a process by which free oxygen radicals can damage fatty cell membranes, was killing off most of these cells. But it wasn\u2019t clear why some are able to survive this.\n\nSource: Nature \n\nDo follow @nerdy_scientists for more latest updates..! 💖\n\n#cancer #tumortherapy #facts #facts💯 #physics #pharmacy #pharmaindustry #scienceiscool #physicsfun  #physicsfacts #corona #computerscience #coronavírus #covi̇d19 #sciencefacts #pandemic #socialdistancing #social  #research  #physicsteacher#cough #coughing #science  #latest #physicslab #trending #factsdaily #teamnerdyscientists","NumberOfLikes":30,"Hashtags":["#cancer","#tumortherapy","#facts","#facts💯","#physics","#pharmacy","#pharmaindustry","#scienceiscool","#physicsfun","#physicsfacts","#corona","#computerscience","#coronavírus","#covi̇d19","#sciencefacts","#pandemic","#socialdistancing","#social","#research","#physicsteache","#cough","#coughing","#science","#latest","#physicslab","#trending","#factsdaily","#teamnerdyscientists"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Nerdy Scientists in University of Texas Medical Branch with @ucl, @chemistry_nerds__, @scientist_maria, @scicomm.group, @thehiddenscience_, @caffeinatedscientist_, @science.fanatics, @chaozinorder, @chloe.the.scientist, @scicomm_geek, @sciencefluencer, @gina_science_says, @curious_geeks, @scientian_abstracon, @sciencenstyle, @scientificsoul01, @scistudent.jm, @scienceandseaweed, and @sciencebash.
