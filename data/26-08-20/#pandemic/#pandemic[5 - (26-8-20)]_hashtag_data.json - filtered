Using data compiled by Araz Chiloyan (@arazchilo ), we were able to create a graph showing COVID-19 trends along with health policy decisions. \n.\n\nWhat is the takeaway here? When restrictions were lifted in April, cases continued to increase: we see a jump in weekly average cases 2-3 weeks after this policy. In early June, enforcement of mask wearing and public health policies became more strict, and about three weeks later we begin to see average weekly cases consistently declining even up until this past week. \n.\n\nSo why is there a 2-3 week delay between policy enactment and a change in trends? Remember that COVID-19 symptoms can take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to the virus, so someone exposed right when a restriction was implemented may go in for testing up to 2 weeks later. Additionally, it takes some time for individuals to adjust behavior after policy change.\n.\n\nIn summary, social distancing and mask wearing works! Keep it up Armenia!\n\n.\n#publichealth #ph #health #covid #covid19 #covid_19 #armenia #armenian #armenianhealth #pandemic #armeniannews #positive #positivity","NumberOfLikes":130,"Hashtags":["#publichealth","#ph","#health","#covid","#covid19","#covid_19","#armenia","#armenian","#armenianhealth","#pandemic","#armeniannews","#positive","#positivity"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1598238962,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 24 05:16:02 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"daggiophoto","CaptionText":"Humanos del 2020\n2020 humans \n\n#pandemic #fotojournalist #journal #pandemia #caserita #mercados #fruts #safe #fotoperiodismo #ecuadorentusojos #streetphotography #lapsocovid19 #humanosdel2020 #2020humans","NumberOfLikes":37,"Hashtags":["#pandemic","#fotojournalist","#journal","#pandemia","#caserita","#mercados","#fruts","#safe","#fotoperiodismo","#ecuadorentusojos","#streetphotography","#lapsocovid19","#humanosdel2020","#2020humans"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598225043,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 24 01:24:03 CEST 2020","Location":"Riobamba"},{"Owner":"matte_church","CaptionText":"Just sharing my thoughts on the pandemic.\n\nI respect everyone and know or do not know that people are dealing with many things that #covid19 had compounded on and or magnified.\n\nBe kind.\nBe empathetic.\n\n#practicerun\n#pandemic\n#covid19 \n#health \n#LIVEHOODANDPROSPER \n#DontMindMatteChurch","NumberOfLikes":28,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#practicerun","#pandemic","#covid19","#health","#LIVEHOODANDPROSPER","#DontMindMatteChurch"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1598238758,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 24 05:12:38 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"angelzierra","CaptionText":"\"Pandemium\" retrato tomado en Miquihuana, Tamps.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#photography #portrait #stars #galaxy #galaxia #vialactea #pandemia #pandemic #virus #coronavirus #covid_19 #fotografia #fotografo #photograper #mexico #angelzierra #landscape #travel #traveller #l4l #f4f #followforfollowback #followme","NumberOfLikes":15,"Hashtags":["#photography","#portrait","#stars","#galaxy","#galaxia","#vialactea","#pandemia","#pandemic","#virus","#coronavirus","#covid_19","#fotografia","#fotografo","#photograper","#mexico","#angelzierra","#landscape","#travel","#traveller","#l4l","#f4f","#followforfollowback","#followme"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Angel Zierra on August 23, 2020.

That after December, it will magically get better. However, that could not be further from the truth; thinking that it is, is dangerous.\n\nWhat we are seeing and experiencing: pandemic; natural disasters and out-of-control wildfires; injustice; and unrest--is simply the beginning of a new normal. A paradigm shift in the stability of our habit: Earth. While they may seem like separate events, they are all connected.\n\nRemember the unprecedented wildfires that occurred in Australia in January? What is currently happening now in California is simply the flipside of the hemispherical coin. And it's only going to get worse. Instances like these; the hurricanes approaching the Gulf; and the unclassified windstorms in the Midwest will continue to amplify every other systemic problem that we face.\n\nWhat is the solution? In broad strokes, unity. We must end the radical polarization that currently divides us through a strategic, empathetic and compassionate approach that puts the good of all humans, our habitat, and co-inhabitors (animals and plants) first--instead of unfettered corporate profits, executive bonuses, and concentration of power.\n\nThose last aspects can only be controlled through policy; we have the power to directly elect the representatives who will be agents of change. Don't like who you see on the ballot? Then it's time to step up. The necessary changes must occur from the inside. Who is going to answer the call?\n\nüì∑: @xtine.lotus watches the sun set behind Desolation Wilderness's Sierra Crest on Wednesday.

It\u2019s a great resource for city dwellers; it offers ideas for local activities and trips, and features NYC artists\/writers. This sculpture is old but Seeing it makes me nostalgic for my daily 7 train commutes.\n\nPosted @withregram \u2022 @epicenter_nyc This week, we are featuring Linda M. Ganjian, @lindaganjian a Queens-based artist who works in a variety of materials, including clay, cement and paper. Her main pursuit has involved making large \u201Ctabletop\u201D sculptures, composed of hundreds of miniature forms, that are a reinterpretation of Middle Eastern and American craft traditions (carpets, quilts, calligraphy). Much of her work presents memories and impressions of the urban landscape, the specific history of a site or more personal narratives. \n\n\u201C7 Train Panoramas\u201D is a sculptural interpretation of the rooftop architecture visible from the 7 train, organized into a quilt-like structure. The forms (made from clay and painted paper-board) reflect the haphazard array of satellite dishes, antenna, skylights, vents, barbed wire, graffiti, etc., she says, \"that mark the landscape my eyes glaze over on my daily commute.\"\n\nWe want to see, hear, feel, support your art and response to this moment.

As we have mentioned before we are in the middle of World War 3, this is taking place between the globalist elite based in London and the deep state in Washington. However, as it is not being fought in a conventional way people do not realize this. The tools being used are biological warfare and economic warfare and this is affecting everyone around the world. In previous videos we talked about the economist and it front page, the war is between the globalist elite which is Wall Street and the deep state which is Main Street. The U.S collects around 4 trillion dollars of tax every year and tax evasion is considered one of the most punishable offences. Although it is difficult to avoid paying taxes, due to the power Wall Street hold they pay little to none tax at all. Most companies are exempt from paying taxes. In contrast, Main Street and the American population pay up to 4 trillion dollars of tax while Wall Street only pays 400 billion dollars. \n\nFollow OTRV On Instagram at: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/otrvideo\/\nFollow OTRV On Twitter At: https:\/\/twitter.com\/OTRVideos\nFollow OTRV On Facebook At: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/offtherecord.otrv.3\n\n#virus #pandemic #ww3 #elite #modernwarfare #biological #tax #taxes #america #dollar #deepstate #globalists #washingtondc #london #theeconomist #wallstreet #mainstreet \n#mediterranean #trump #washingtonpost #wallstreetjournal #newyorktimes #robertmueller #OTRV","NumberOfLikes":2,"Hashtags":["#virus","#pandemic","#ww3","#elite","#modernwarfare","#biological","#tax","#taxes","#america","#dollar","#deepstate","#globalists","#washingtondc","#london","#theeconomist","#wallstreet","#mainstreet","#mediterranean","#trump","#washingtonpost","#wallstreetjournal","#newyorktimes","#robertmueller","#OTRV"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by OTRV on August 23, 2020.

Repost @gaiasquarci\n„Éª„Éª„Éª\nPosting a few selects and outtakes from a recent @newyorkermag story about pastor Juan Carlos Ruiz, who became a point of reference for immigrant communities in Brooklyn during the Covid-19 lockdown. I followed him for one day, from the moment he picked up bags of rice, beans and flour at a wholesale supermarket in the morning through his food distribution for families economically impacted by the pandemic at his church in Bay Ridge, ending with a meeting he held to help volunteers start a cooperative of construction and find employment during these dark times. \nFrom the secular perspective I come from, I saw what I was hoping for. A church alive and truly at the service of the people. Fresh produce cardboard boxes in the nave and folks walking in to work hard for others, feeling at home. \nIn the evening Juan Carlos explained to me his perspective: \"Worship for me is and has always been trying to have the right relationship to other people, to the economy which influences all interpersonal relationships, to the environment, to god.\" It's the kind of vision that another part of the church doesn't get, and that got him in trouble many times. #covid19 #pandemic #bayridge #brooklyn #pastor #fooddistribution #community  #jonathanblitzer #mexico #futbol #puebla #sunsetpark #labor #undocumented #abolishICE #8645 #86GOP #newsanctuarycoalition #maketheroadny #defineamerican #justicedemocrats #borderangels #alotrolado_org #unitedwedream #aoc #ReframeToReform #somosmas #votolatino #FreeThemAll #TrumpVirus","NumberOfLikes":38,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#pandemic","#bayridge","#brooklyn","#pastor","#fooddistribution","#community","#jonathanblitzer","#mexico","#futbol","#puebla","#sunsetpark","#labor","#undocumented","#abolishICE","#8645","#86GOP","#newsanctuarycoalition","#maketheroadny","#defineamerican","#justicedemocrats","#borderangels","#alotrolado_org","#unitedwedream","#aoc","#ReframeToReform","#somosmas","#votolatino","#FreeThemAll","#TrumpVirus"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Jim McKay on August 23, 2020.

Positive social interaction lessens anxiety and helps us gain perspective.\n- Avoid sugar and caffeine\n- Set goals. They don\u2019t need to be big triumphs.

Key factors put with simplicity to help understand how things were already \"non-normal\" prior pandemic, and what to notice moving forward.\nKEY NOTES & INTERESTING FACTS:\n- In the previous history:\n a) debt was used toward investing to produce future growth and return, VS now went to buy back shares.\nb) debt to equity didn't surpass 30% where now went beyond 100% ! More debt was produced within the last 3 -4 months than the last decades.\n- (min 5.20) The Non essential parts of economics that had to shut down with pandemic, was the 80% of GDP. Non jobs related to physics, engineering, science.. yet lower income streams mainly, as tourism, hospitality, hotels, leisure etc.\nThose jobs designed to have lower wages for the majority of the masses, so even when unemployment rate was very low, there was not a significant impact on GDP\n- About half of American households had NO savings to cope with 3 months of lockdown\n- The application of the checks issued from government being very different than savings coming from normal wages ( money going toward rent, utilities, food, pharmaceuticals.. rather than toward entertainment and other non essential spending)\n- One of the main issues moving forward will be and is Economic Inequality\n.\nBonus point: I appreciated the point the interviewer made: as it happened for the 11th\/9 with terroris m attack, that saw then policies and operations significant changes (ex. with airlines..), this pandemic will welcome permanent changes to affect lives and businesses moving forward (i.e. in relation to hygiene standards, contact etc)\n.\nWelcome to surprise with a comment or quick opinion,as you read so far. Let's have a great day.. and stay mentally awake!

The various rallies were held under banners such as the \u201CNo Marxism in America Rally\u201D and the \u201CTrump 2020 Cruise Rally.\u201D Counter-protesters from anti-fascist groups like Popular Mobilization PDX also gathered Saturday, and the two groups quickly began shouting at each other and engaging in tense, face-to-face confrontations in front of the Multnomah County Justice Center. Within an hour of meeting, protesters began to push each other and throw objects. Some demonstrators on the pro-police side fired paintball guns and deployed pepper spray on counterdemonstrators. Other protesters used baseball bats. Many people wore helmets and body armor as they punched, kicked and tore at each other. Ahead of the weekend rallies, the FBI said it had received a bomb threat against federal buildings in Portland. The agency said it was still assessing the credibility of the threat Friday, and closed federal buildings through the weekend as a precaution.

Education is a right for every child regardless of their disabilities, delays and differences. This pandemic has made it easier for the education system to back off, wash their hands and \"remote\" teach. The education of our children is in the hands of automated programs designed to keep the kids glued to a computer with looped exercises. Since when is education only about factual knowledge? School used to be all about teaching children how to teach themselves. School used to teach children how to live in society. How can remote learning fulfill that right? We setting our next generations up for failure and everyone seems to be okay with that. Do you think for a second that schools and teachers will ever get back to teaching children full time? I don't think so. Why work hard or work period when a program can do that and they are still being paid for it? #covid19 was the excuse the #education system has been waiting for to switch models. What a #shame. \n\nÿßŸÑÿ™ÿπŸÑŸäŸÖ ÿ≠ŸÇ ŸàŸÑŸäÿ≥ ŸÅÿ±ÿµÿ©.

Het trieste hoogtepunt zou bereikt worden in september met 1000 doden per dag, ondanks het feit dat naar schatting driekwart van de bevolking de stad dan al was ontvlucht. Nochtans had tsarina Catharina de Grote eerder dat jaar, op 17 maart (ongeveer zoals bij ons) dringende quarantainemaatregelen afgekondigd in Moskou: theatervoorstellingen, bals en grote publieke samenkomsten werden verboden. Builenpest kende\/kent immers een hoge mortaliteit (anders dan corona): zonder behandeling overleeft minder dan 40% van de geiÃànfecteerde personen de infectie. Toch had de ramp zich toen niet doorgezet: de strenge Russische winter had een remmend effect op de verspreiding van de pestbacil, waardoor het dodental snel was afgenomen. De maatregelen werden afgebouwd, maar eind juni (ongeveer zoals bij ons) kwam de pest terug opzetten. Strenge maatregelen waren aangewezen, maar hier stuitten de medisch wetenschappelijke denkbeelden op de tradities en emoties van de bevolking. In heel Moskou braken rellen uit, mensen forceerden zich een weg tot de pesthospitalen om bij hun dierbaren te komen die daar afgezonderd lagen. De doden die buiten de stad waren begraven werden opgegraven om ze binnen de stadsmuren opnieuw ter aarde te bestellen. De doden werden zelfs door hun nabestaanden omhelsd, zoals de Russische traditie dat voorschreef. Aartsbisschop Ambrose van Moskou, die probeerde de gemoederen nog te bedaren, werd gelyncht door de menigte. Gevolg van dit volksoproer was dat elke rem op de pestepidemie verdween. Dat de epidemie tenslotte toch uitdoofde kwam weer door de winter, die dat volgende jaar zelfs voor Russische begrippen uitzonderlijk streng en langdurig was.

I feel guilty for even saying that, because everyone is struggling, and if someone's not, they're probably an asshole.\n\nBut 2019 was supposed to be my bad year. 2019 is when I did the hard shit. I ended my marriage, I identified the abuse I endured, I dug deep into my own healing, I began a new and healthy relationship, I got a job, I put my kids in school and daycare, I found a new home, I finally approached polyamory on my own terms. I fought like hell to save myself and I barely made it. 2019 took everything I had.\n\nI made no resolutions for 2020. I intended to take this year at face value, to enjoy the life I tried so hard to get. At first, it seemed like that was really happening. My kids and I settled into normalcy. Our new apartment felt like home. I felt more confident at my new job. I met someone wonderful.\n\nYet this year keeps demanding more and more and I have nothing left. I am spent. The routine I fought so hard to establish for my family was shattered months ago with no return in sight. I'm back to being a stay at home parent half the time, which I hated before, and now I have a full time job on top of it. Soon my oldest will start all-online kindergarten, and I dropped out of early childhood ed after my first year of college. Meanwhile, the pandemic continues unchecked and no one really seems to care.\n\nMost days it's just too much.\n\nMy therapist tells me to do self care, but it's really hard to do that when the unknown threats that lie ahead loom over me constantly.\n\nOccasionally there are moments when I'm astonished that we're all supposed to carry on like this is normal. There's no relief, no assistance on its way, whether it's financial or emotional or practical. This capitalist hellscape proves once again that our lives are nothing, our physical health is nothing, and our emotional health is nothing, unless you can profit off of it.\n\n(Continued in comments ‚¨áÔ∏è)","NumberOfLikes":32,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Skylar Camp in Columbus, Ohio.

It made me nostalgic for the days when we could eat in restaurants, shake hands to greet each other, and go to work or school without having to wear a mask, stay six feet away from each other, or slather ourselves in hand sanitizer. Whenever I go to the grocery store and see everyone wearing masks, I feel sad about how quickly and drastically everything changed. I will never again take for granted the feeling of fresh air on my face. I wear the mask in public because I have to, but I hope someday to be free of the restrictions the pandemic has forced us to adhere to.

Com a quarentena, muitos de n√≥s fomos levados a ficar mais em casa, a sair menos. \n\nA consequ√™ncia √© que, por falta de op√ß√µes, necessidades limitadas ou mesmo por uma decis√£o consciente sobre essa nova realidade, nos √∫ltimos meses, gastamos menos. Diante disso, como fazer essa economia extra fazer parte do nosso planejamento financeiro quando a vida \u201Cvoltar ao normal\u201D?\n\nEm primeiro lugar, vamos pensar no que realmente aconteceu para que \u201Csobrasse\u201D dinheiro no final do m√™s. A verdade √© que muitos dos nossos gastos habituais, como jantares, cinemas, festas, compras, foram postergados. \n\nMas, at√© aqui, a mudan√ßa √© passageira. Talvez voc√™ apenas adiou a compra de um carro novo para mais adiante, ou postergou aquele curso que tanto queria para quando puder frequentar as aulas.\n\nAo sermos for√ßados a gastar menos, por√©m, podemos nos questionar sobre nossos h√°bitos antigos. Sobre com o que gast√°vamos nossos dinheiros e como aquilo verdadeiramente afetava a nossa sensa√ß√£o de bem estar e felicidade. E √© isso que vai fazer a diferen√ßa nas nossas finan√ßas pessoais.\n\nUm primeiro passo para manter a economia alcan√ßada √© se questionar: dentre tantas coisas, itens de consumo, ou mesmo despesas fixas, que voc√™ abriu m√£o nesse per√≠odo, de quais deles voc√™ mais sente falta? Quais s√£o os mais dispens√°veis? Sente-se indiferente sobre algo especificamente, ou com muita falta de outra coisa?

A relief that I had not known for quite a few months. \n\nI looked at myself , and saw myself.

This way was the way of how other people dressed , and I was obsessed with how they dressed . It was the only thing that I was seeing around and then when I saw myself in the mirror , I just did not look like them. My wardrobe was completely different and I wanted to change it, so I did. \n\nBut after I started going out a little , well we had to get our coffees , right ? I wore those outfits, I was fitting in and almost everyone around me looked the same with flared jeans , tank top , sneaks and a sling diagonally worn. I finally fit in , I was trendy, I was everywhere I looked around . \n\nAfter I had had my Irish cream coffee from the Big Chill Caf√© ,I was feeling pretty good , it was a Sunday. I looked into the mirror. Several times. But I could not recognise myself . At all. Where was I ? Where was all that style I had so proudly worn as mine ? It was now where to be found , until today. \n\nToday, I would finally say , that I styled myself . I saw myself almost a bit more than I saw myself in the mirror the last time. It was difficult to re-find my style amidst the style that was flooding around me in a quarantine . \n\nI hope that once you get out of the quarantine and start styling yourself and suggestively start living your life to the fullest , something that this pandemic has taught us apparently , I sorely hope that you see yourself in the mirror .\n\n#styling #pandemic#only#converse#adidas#promos#styleforyourself#personalityisyou#beingyou#beingfiercelyyou","NumberOfLikes":24,"Hashtags":["#styling","#pandemi","#onl","#convers","#adida","#promo","#styleforyoursel","#personalityisyo","#beingyo","#beingfiercelyyou"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Aakriti and Naina in Khan Market with @converse, @adidasoriginals, @promod, @coffeenclothes, and @onlyfansofficial.

It can be hard enough trying to decide what to do let alone in a pandemic. \n-\n- \nAfter doing my A levels (Psychology, Travel & Tourism,  IT) I knew straight away that I was done with education. I had worked for what felt like my whole life in education, trying so hard with my school work and fitting into the mould that is the school system. \n\n-\n-\nSo I took a gap year. Worked in an office temporary job, alongside my job at Sainsburys. Quit Sainsburys to do my office job as my 9 - 5. The goal? To save up enough money to go travelling. A friend and I went to Thailand and working that boring 9 - 5 office job made me realise that Is not something I wanted to do in the future.

Blocking the middle seat is such a huge plus, not only does it give you more room, but it truthfully mitigates the risk of COVID-19.  Additionally , the cabin crew ensured everyone was properly wearing a mask , and those that had masks with exhalation valves got surgical masks to cover them.  I'd put the actual flight as the lowest risk of the whole experience.  Not only is the cabin air refreshed with filtered air every few minutes , but everyone had their masks on.  The airport gate however is where I believe the highest risk of transmission is.  While 80% were wearing masks properly, 20% seemed to forget that the nose is part of their respiratory system. However both Newark and Florida had EXTREMLY high levels of mask wearing.  I actually didn't see a single person without a mask.  All in all despite prevalence being much higher now than when I flew back in March, the added safety measures definitely mitigate the spread.  Sanitizing surfaces , mask wearing , physical distancing when possible, have synergistic effects.  These measures are simple , and can allow us to enjoy things like traveling.  They give you more freedom , while keeping you safe.  10\/10 experience with @jetblue.  If you are flying during this pandemic , they need to be on the top of your list.","NumberOfLikes":176,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":33,"Timestamp":1598202920,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 19:15:20 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"amyippoliti","CaptionText":"(Sound ON üéß) The COVID Pandemic has held up a mirror to our fractured relationship with the natural world.

In the last 7 months, we have seen giant progress in his verbal communication skills. He seems to be more excited to see familiar faces and engage with us, he is repeating more words and phrases, and is overall engaging in more functional play with us. It\u2019s really one of the best things to come out of this whole pandemic \n\nThat being said, before everything was shut down in March, Bodhi was just starting to adjust to Early Intervention Preschool. They were working so hard with him on play skills with peers. This is an area where I have seen huge regression lately and it\u2019s very frustrating. I cannot tell you how many times this summer a child around his age has approached him at the park or at the lake or at the pool excited to engage with him, and Bodhi screamed and ran away ‚òπÔ∏è it\u2019s almost as if he was afraid of them. This is something that obviously needs to be worked in social settings daily.\n\nDue to the current school environment, we made the decision to keep Bodhi home from pre-k this fall until at least some of the pandemic protocols calm down. I know this is the right decision though I\u2019m very nervous for his continued regression with social skills.\n\nAutism is a constant see-saw and a balancing act. It\u2019s frustrating. I feel like when we see one huge gain in an area it\u2019s as a result of a regression in another one. We are still figuring this out.

Kalau tiba-tiba teringat pada anak, kirimkan bacaan Al Fatihah. Sampai ke ayat \"Iyyakana'budu waiyyakanasta'in\" (\"Hanya kepada Mu kami menyembah dan hanya kepadaMU kami memohon pertolongan.\"), mintalah apa-apa hajat saat itu yang ada hubungannya dengan anak yang kita ingat saat itu, habiskan bacaan surah Al Fatihah doakan semoga anak kita diberi kepahaman yang sebenarnya dalam urusan agamanya, memiliki ilmu yang bermanfaat dan serahkan urusan anak kepada Allah untuk menjaganya.\n\n2. Pandang wajahnya saat dia tidur, ucapkan....\"Ibu mau (nama anak) jadi anak yang sholeh, sayang...\"\nCoba amalkan (seperti kata Ustadz, kata-kata ini bermakna kita bercakap dengan rohnya) \ndan ucapan ini adalah DOA, sesungguhnya Allah Maha Mendengar lagi Maha Melihat.\n\n3. Bangun shalat malam, shalat lah disisinya. Maksudnya kita shalat dalam kamar dia dan dekat dengan ananda. Jika Kita sering melakukannya dan kita juga selalu beritahu dia bahwa kita sering doakan dia, dia akan merasakan satu  ikatan kasih sayang yang hakiki yang kita sangat sayang pada dia dan mau dia jadi anak yang sholeh. Dia akan tahu kita selalu shalat hajat untuknya.\n\n4. Minta dikasihani. Ucapkan setiap saat bahwa kita ini sedang menunggu panggilan Allah. Jika dia tidak jadi anak sholeh bermakna dia tidak sayang kita dan tentunya kita akan merana di Alam Barzah nanti.\n\n5. Peluklah anak selalu walaupun dia sudah besar, sebagaimana kita sayang dia saat kecilnya. Aura ciuman dan belaian Ibu sambil bisikkan padanya bahwa kita bangga mempunyai anak sepertinya.\n\n6. Maafkan anak kita setiap waktu walaupun perbuatannya amat melukai hati kita. Muhasabah diri, mungkin kesalahan yang anak kita lakukan itu adalah karena dosa-dosa kita di masa lalu.\n\n7. Yang paling penting jaga tutur kata kita, jangan sekali-kali ucapkan perkataan yang bisa melukai hatinya. Jika ini terjadi juga karena kita khilaf, cepat-cepat cari waktu yang sesuai untuk kita minta maaf padanya. Mengakulah padanya itu kelemahan kita, kita marah karena dia berbuat salah, bukan bermaksud membenci. \n\nBersambung ke comentüëá","NumberOfLikes":4,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by üß°PertemananShalihat Communityüß° on August 23, 2020.
