The movie felt extremely real. I liked how it was a shot, through zoom, but it could have been better. I really thought it was unique that the film was shot in real time. This a definitely a movie you would want to watch during quarantine, being this film takes place during the Coronavirus pandemic. They make a few references to the current pandemic. This film had many scenes that will make you jump. I thought these scenes were executed phenomenally. One scene that I thought was great was when the filter face was floating in mid air, and the girl reached for the face and it turned to face her. This demon was as scary as any demon that we have seen it quite sometime. This film focused more on scaring the life out of you than anything else. The characters lacked substance but that wasn\u2019t the point of this film. The final scene, although predictable, has the ability to make you jump 12 feet in the air. Again, this film has many scenes that are capable of scaring just about anybody.

Many times, when the everyday stress of life does not have an outlet, combined with sleep deprivation and lack of proper nutrition , the situation may create reactions instead of responses to life\u2019s challenges. These reactions can create additional situations leading to a vicious cycle of overwhelm, frustration and feelings of powerlessness which repeats the cycle. Sometimes we are forced to stop the stress cycle in various ways giving us time to reevaluate our lives and the decisions we make that lead us to an out-of-control feeling in our lives.\n\nFive minutes each day can start you on a different pathway. Start small and increase the skill of self-care through practice and consistency.\n\nTry to do at least 5 things in a day, here is the list! \n\n1. Try to connect with people that make you great and accept you as it is.\n2. Open the window to let in some fresh air to boost your mind.\n3. Take a bubble bath.\n4. Go to bed early and get plenty of sleep\n5. Stay hydrated. Drink 8 glasses of water in one day. Schedule your time to drink water.\n6. Take a hike in nature to ground yourself. Find and explore a local park you\u2019ve never been to before. \n7. Do some exercise  or mediation to calm your nerves.\n8. Read a good book instead of spending time on social media.\n9. Spend your time cuddling pets ad took them for a walk.\n10. Eat light healthy food. \n\nSo there you have it--a recipe for self-care. Will you take the time to make these small changes?

It can also infect humans and is known as Weil's disease. \n\nDon't believe the scare stories- if you have concerns regarding vaccinating your pet please speak to your vet who will be happy to discuss this with you... don't rely on Facebook groups or Instagram accounts that are spreading false rumours!\n\nThere are those who want to see a world with no vaccines. Well, this coronavirus pandemic has shown us what the world is like without just one specific vaccine. \n\nPlease share to spread the world - vaccines work!\n\n#vaccines #vaccineswork #science #medicine #epidemiology #scicomm #pandemic #covid19 #pets #animals #dogs #dogstagram #ilovemydog #cats #horses #veterinary #vetlife #vetmed #stbernard #health #healthylifestyle #natural #animalphotography #thatface #farming #veterinarian #puppy #fakenews  #naturalhealth","NumberOfLikes":61,"Hashtags":["#Repost","#vaccines","#vaccineswork","#science","#medicine","#epidemiology","#scicomm","#pandemic","#covid19","#pets","#animals","#dogs","#dogstagram","#ilovemydog","#cats","#horses","#veterinary","#vetlife","#vetmed","#stbernard","#health","#healthylifestyle","#natural","#animalphotography","#thatface","#farming","#veterinarian","#puppy","#fakenews","#naturalhealth"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Vetlife on August 23, 2020.

It is slowly instilled in each one of us through the religion, astrology and apparitions. But, each of us go through the fear of living  on a daily basis.\n\nThrough teenage and adulthood, you find yourself constantly questioning the decisions you make. You question long existing beliefs and values and try to figure out a way of life. You wade through self-doubt and hope for a life of ease. However, in each step of this process, there is a fear that is persistent throughout. Some fear failure while a few fear challenges and obstacles. Many want constant success and a life that is a bed of roses. \n\nFear of living manifests itself in so many ways- some rational, some irrational. The fear of facing oneself, the fear to blindly accept faith\/religion, fear of losing loved ones, fear of falling in love, fear of opinions and arguments, fear of letting things be, fear of taking action, fear of success\/failure, fear of dominance\/ power, fear of society, and finally, fear of death.\n\nI wake up with this fear on a daily basis, live and laugh through it. Sometimes it's so overwhelming that I curl up in my bed and hate myself for it, but other times, it motivates me to face it. Often, fear is instilled because of our past experiences or present failures. There is so much hesitation to do what I fear the most, and honestly, facing it does not make it better the next time. However, I keep trying to face it every single time hoping that this fear leaves me atleast for a moment.\n\nFeel free to contact or DM here to share more.\n\nIllustration: @elesq \n\n#mentalhealthawarenessmonth #mentalhealth #therapy #therapysession  #pandemic #fear #anxietyproblems #fearofgod #fearless #psychedelicart #psychologyfacts #counselling #counsellingservices #covidart #covidmentalhealth #covidthoughts","NumberOfLikes":41,"Hashtags":["#mentalhealthawarenessmonth","#mentalhealth","#therapy","#therapysession","#pandemic","#fear","#anxietyproblems","#fearofgod","#fearless","#psychedelicart","#psychologyfacts","#counselling","#counsellingservices","#covidart","#covidmentalhealth","#covidthoughts"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by The Humdrums on August 23, 2020 tagging @elesq.","NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1598188139,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 15:08:59 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Long.

Shelters are enforcing social distancing rules and mask wearing, but officials say evacuees should consider sheltering with family and friends. \n📸: AP \n\n#California #Wildfires #Fire #USA #America #NapaValley #Sonoma #NorthernCalifornia #PresidentTrump #Trump #Hot #Coronavirus #Covid #Covid19 #Pandemic #USNews #Climate #ClimateChange #Summer #Channel4 #Channel4News","NumberOfLikes":249,"Hashtags":["#California","#Wildfires","#Fire","#USA","#America","#NapaValley","#Sonoma","#NorthernCalifornia","#PresidentTrump","#Trump","#Hot","#Coronavirus","#Covid","#Covid19","#Pandemic","#USNews","#Climate","#ClimateChange","#Summer","#Channel4","#Channel4News"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":15,"Timestamp":1598186904,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 14:48:24 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"⠀\n초록빛 가득했던 큰그림농장이 그립다.\n장마로 시설하우스 45동 전체가 잠기면서 수확 직전의 작물들은 속절없이 쓸려갔고 하우스 내부엔 토사가 가득하고 트랙터, 포장박스 농장의 모든 것이 피해를 입었다.\n흙에 물이 가득해 기계도 발도 푹푹 빠져서 복구를 시작하지 못 했고 그저 비가 그치고 땅이 마르길 기다렸다. 지난주에 마흔다섯동의 하우스에 가득 찬 토사를 삽으로 퍼내기위해 대민지원이 약속돼있었지만 코로나19의 심각화로 전면 취소.\n⠀\n⠀\n내년 오픈 예정인 쏠티팜클럽의 설계를 진행하면서\n왠지 기대보다 걱정이 더 커지는 요즘 -\n포스트코로나, 팬데믹 현상, 언택트 시대. 이 단어만 봐도 숨이 막힌다.\n코로나 이전의 시대로 돌아갈 수 없을 것이라는 말 역시.\n⠀\n쏠티팜클럽이 내가 꿈꾸던 모습대로 되지는 않을 것 같단 생각이 든다.\n그렇지만 이 공간은, 그렇기에 아이들에게 부모들에게 우리 모두에게\n더 소중하고 온기가 있는 공간이 될 것이라 확신한다.\n⠀\n⠀\n⠀\n\u201C기쁨은 근육과도 같아서 쓸 수록 강해진다.\u201D\n\u201C현재 기뻐하기로 결심하면, 내 과거의 사건들이 새롭게 회생되고,\n미래에도 희망에 불이 밝혀진다.\u201D\n2020.08.23 분당우리교회 이찬수목사님 설교 중\n⠀\n⠀\n#늘그랬듯언제나우리는답을찾을것이다\n⠀","NumberOfLikes":110,"Hashtags":["#늘그랬듯언제나우리는답을찾을것이다"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":26,"Timestamp":1598186893,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 14:48:13 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"please press subscribe @playonjaedragon 's YouTube channel!

But the suspension of flights and safari visits because of the COVID-19 pandemic has decimated this critical source of income\u2014and devastated the wildlife conservation efforts it funds. The repercussions for flora and fauna are far-reaching. Anything with a horn or tusk is at greater risk today than yesterday. \u2060⠀\n\u2060⠀\nThe economics of wildlife reserves are somewhat opaque, and few visitors to the parks and reserves understand their significance to their business models. At least half their revenue\u2014and in some cases all of it\u2014comes from tourism. The money is used to protect wildlife by paying operating costs, employing rangers, and maintaining security. These places are the economic lifeblood of the regions they serve. Many support local schools and health clinics and employ local people\u2014who might otherwise work in charcoal production and bushmeat hunting\u2014in nature-based jobs.\u2060⠀\n\u2060⠀\nThis was supposed to be a \u201Csuper year\u201D for biodiversity. Instead, the world is facing a shocking, real-time need for action. That is why TNC and other environmental NGOs are calling for 30 percent of the Earth\u2019s surface to be protected by 2030, through the so-called 30x30 commitment. To build a world in which humans \u201Cdo no harm\u201D and create space for nature to flourish, a broad swath of private protected areas\u2014such as forests that are lightly, sustainably logged, and marine protected areas that allow only for small-scale, sustainable fishing\u2014will also be needed. Such diversification is necessary in order to ensure fiscal and environmental health. \u2060⠀\n\u2060⠀\nDespite the challenges, there is no reason that we can\u2019t deliver net gains for nature.

During the 2016 campaign, Trump promised repeatedly that, if elected, he would construct a wall along the southern border \u2014 funded by Mexico. As president, he has made no headway on getting Mexico to pay for the wall and has tangled with Congress over whether U.S. taxpayers should fund the project.\n\nProsecutors alleged that Bannon and Kolfage along with two others \u2014 Andrew Badolato and Timothy Shea \u2014 routed payments from the crowdfunding campaign through the nonprofit and another shell company, disguising them with fake invoices to help keep their personal pay secret.\n\nAll four were arrested Thursday and charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering. After being later released on bond, Bannon emerged from the federal courthouse in Manhattan, taking off his mask and smiling at a bank of television cameras. \u201CThis entire fiasco is to stop people who want to build the wall,\u201D he said.\n\nWith the indictment of Bannon, prosecutors have now brought criminal charges against more than half a dozen people who worked for Trump\u2019s campaign or his administration or advised him personally. Those who have been convicted or pleaded guilty to federal crimes include Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, his deputy campaign chairman, his former personal attorney and his former national security adviser.\n.\n.\n.\n#abcnews #washingtonpost #thisisamerica #stevebannon #usacorruption #mexicanborder #trumpswall #coronavirus #covid19 #pandemic #stayhome #quarantine #abuseofpower #fucktrump #2020 \n\n☑️ 𝗙𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗼𝘄 @sacredeyes_magazine #sacredeyes_magazine","NumberOfLikes":43,"Hashtags":["#abcnews","#washingtonpost","#thisisamerica","#stevebannon","#usacorruption","#mexicanborder","#trumpswall","#coronavirus","#covid19","#pandemic","#stayhome","#quarantine","#abuseofpower","#fucktrump","#2020","#sacredeyes_magazine"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1598178904,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 12:35:04 CEST 2020","Location":"Mexican Border"},{"CaptionText":"#instagood #instagram #twitter #tweetforfun #trending #instadaily #moodtweets #memelovers #memesdaily #absolutetweets #instatwitter #tweets #fun #laugh #twitterquotes #coronavirus #pandemic #okaybye","NumberOfLikes":24,"Hashtags":["#instagood","#instagram","#twitter","#tweetforfun","#trending","#instadaily","#moodtweets","#memelovers","#memesdaily","#absolutetweets","#instatwitter","#tweets","#fun","#laugh","#twitterquotes","#coronavirus","#pandemic","#okaybye"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Absolute Tweets on August 23, 2020.

Haven't we all lost our minds being locked up. Writing, conceptualising and directing a movie during these tough times is remarkable and here's #TheGoneGame, a four episode web series, that entirely defines our ambiguities and uncertainties regarding the pandemic. What blew my mind is the fact that the whole thing was shot indoors and none of them had to step out of their homes.\n. \nMystery thrillers always possessed a vocabulary that seemed very familiar like the crime spot, weapons, evidences, suspects etc but now it's all different. Quarantine, Lockdown, curfew, self isolation these words have taken over the scene. An year ago we hardly knew what quarantine means. And this series has successfully captured the haplessness of the pandemic. \n. \nThe plot is very fresh and we get to see a wonderful cast showcasing their best and also the new normal has pushed filmmakers to experiment with technology and bring out the best possible outcome. This edgy and gripping thriller won't disappoint you. \n.\nStreaming on @vootselect\n.\n#indiancinema #bollywood #webseries #Lockdown #pandemic #covid19 #coronavirus #thegonegame #mumbai #arjunmathur #sanjaykapoor #rukhsarrahman #shriyapilgaonkar #shwetatripathi #enoughsaid","NumberOfLikes":47,"Hashtags":["#TheGoneGame,","#indiancinema","#bollywood","#webseries","#Lockdown","#pandemic","#covid19","#coronavirus","#thegonegame","#mumbai","#arjunmathur","#sanjaykapoor","#rukhsarrahman","#shriyapilgaonkar","#shwetatripathi","#enoughsaid"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Cinema Aficionado on August 23, 2020 tagging @shriya.pilgaonkar, @arjun__mathur, @rukhsarrehman, @battatawada, @nix_bhat, @sanjaykapoor2500, and @vootselect.

I\u2019ve decided to start selling them. They\u2019re £7 each or 3 for £20. I\u2019ll be donating £1 from the sale of each mask to @refugecharity . Their work involves crisis and ongoing support for women and children who are victims or survivors of domestic violence through a range of services. Postage is £1 for UK, £3 for Europe and £4 for Australia. Let me know if you would like one or many, I have lots of different colours available. #FaceMask #FaceCovering #Mask #StayHomeStaySafe #Covid19 #Coronavirus #Pandemic #Sewing #SewingProject #SewingBee #SewingFun #Sew #LoveToSew #HomeMade #MadeByMe #Rainbow #Dinosaur #Chilli #FashionMask #Glasgow #NHS #ComfortableMask #Effective  #Adjustable #SupportCharity #CovidKindness #YouAreNotAlone #SupportEachOther #RefugeCharity #UniquelyDominique","NumberOfLikes":17,"Hashtags":["#FaceMask","#FaceCovering","#Mask","#StayHomeStaySafe","#Covid19","#Coronavirus","#Pandemic","#Sewing","#SewingProject","#SewingBee","#SewingFun","#Sew","#LoveToSew","#HomeMade","#MadeByMe","#Rainbow","#Dinosaur","#Chilli","#FashionMask","#Glasgow","#NHS","#ComfortableMask","#Effective","#Adjustable","#SupportCharity","#CovidKindness","#YouAreNotAlone","#SupportEachOther","#RefugeCharity","#UniquelyDominique"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1598176860,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 12:01:00 CEST 2020","Location":"West End, Glasgow."},{"CaptionText":"Remembering flying to Vegas this day last year.

It is necessary not to overlook the word 'principal', for it signifies that while it is on these three great teachings that the Craft lays the greatest emphasis, yet there are other teachings of almost equal importance. In any discussion of our subject those others must not be lost sight of.\n\nBy a 'tenet' is meant some teaching so obviously true, so universally accepted, that we believe it without question and always take it for granted. Examples of such teachings lie everywhere about us. Good health is better than illness; a truthful man is more dependable than a liar; it is better to save money than to waste it; education is to be preferred to ignorance these are but a few of the countless examples of teachings that no intelligent man can possibly call into question. Everybody takes them for granted. They are tenets.\n\nWhen we turn to the Principal Tenets of Freemasonry we are at once struck by an interesting fact - Freemasonry considers Brotherly Love, Relief and Truth to be teachings of this kind! It holds them to be true in a sense that no man can question them. They are obvious; axiomatic, self-proving. I wonder if you have always considered them to be so?

Pasalnya, peraturan itu dibuat di tengah - tengah kebingungan menghindar dari kejaran virus corona di Aceh, ujarnya.\n\n\"Aturan itu bagus, tetapi akan lebih bagus lagi ditunda hingga masyarakat betul - betul nyaman dalam mendulang rupiah untuk memenuhi kehidupannya sehari - hari,\" ujar Dedy ketika sedang mengantri di SPBU Lambuk, BandaAceh.\n\nAmatan KBA.ONE, Sabtu 22 Agustus 2020, di beberapa SPBU di Kota Banda Aceh, sebagian masyarakat yang menggunakan mobil menerima dipasang stiker dan ada juga yang terpaksa membeli dan mengisi BBM non subsidi.\n\nSementara itu, pengamat ekonomi dari Fakultas Ekonomi dan Bisnis Universitas Syiah Kuala Banda Aceh, Amri, saat dihubungi KBA.ONE, mengatakan kebijakan itu tidak pernah benar dan salah. Akan tetapi, melihat kondisi seperti ini pemerintah seharusnya sabar dan menunda dulu kebijakan itu hingga Aceh terbebas dari pandemi covid-19.\n\nSelama covid merebak, dikatakan Amri, dari sisi kegiatan ekonomi dan bisnis sangat berpengaruh, baik dari level paling tinggi, menengah, hingga level paling bawah, sangat berdampak, ujarnya.\n\n\"Artinya, kegiatan ekonomi hampir mati total dan mulai 'layu'. Sampai ketingkat warung kopi, ada yang tutup disebabkan tidak mampu membayar sewa,\" ungkap Amri.\n\nSumber : @kba.one \n#stickers #bbm #prokontra #spbu #pandemic #unsyiah #pengamat #amri","NumberOfLikes":12,"Hashtags":["#stickers","#bbm","#prokontra","#spbu","#pandemic","#unsyiah","#pengamat","#amri"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by bansa.nanggroe in Banda Aceh, Indonesia.

The journal is available online for all to read! \n.\n.\nMany thanks to my parents for being able to financially, morally and emotionally supporting me through this journey, I wouldn\u2019t have done it without them. \nMany thanks to both of the universities for setting the stepping stones to my very bright future for my Masters in Medical Biotechnology!! \n\n#academia #french #france #etudiant #etudie #university #lafrance #caen #normandie #blessed #happiness #lifegoals #pandemic #blessed2020","NumberOfLikes":36,"Hashtags":["#academia","#french","#france","#etudiant","#etudie","#university","#lafrance","#caen","#normandie","#blessed","#happiness","#lifegoals","#pandemic","#blessed2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":14,"Timestamp":1598152236,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 05:10:36 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"ગણપતિ બાપ્પા મોરયા.. \n#ganesha#2020#pandemic","NumberOfLikes":130,"Hashtags":["#ganesh","#202","#pandemic"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Dabhoi Voice on August 22, 2020.

As for the future of this account im going to try my best to keep updating and posting. As I heal from my own traumas I hope ill be able to  inspire others to reach out and talk about their problems with professionals because after all a problem shared is a problem halved. I hope that eventually this will make a beautiful recovery story and turn into a space filled with only love and  positivity. I hope to feel confident enough to share parts of my story with you in the near future because mental illness is the realist thing in today's world and no one should ever suffer alone. Its okay not to be okay and its okay to ask for help when you're struggling. My inbox is always open if you need someone to talk to, you will get through this 🦋💙","NumberOfLikes":0,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by a n n a l i s e 🍃🌍  new acc on August 22, 2020.

Congress heard the (bugle) call and responded with what #SenateMajorityLeader #MitchMcConnell (R-KY) called a \u201Cwartime level of investment into our nation.\u201D\nCalling #coronavirus (#COVId19) the \u201C#invisibleenemy,\u201D🤣🤣 the president has called for \u201Cshared sacrifices\u201D and a \u201Cresponse unseen since World War II.\u201D\nThe president is getting a hefty fiscal fix through a $2 trillion stimulus spending bill moving to his desk shortly for signature. Spanning nearly twenty years of conflict, the #warsinIraq and #Afghanistan cost the #taxpayer roughly $1.5 trillion dollars 🤔🤔 by comparison.\nThe stakes are high, and no one is immune. The military is ramping up to support state and local authorities in responding to the pandemic. The Department of Defense is also confronting the rise of infected servicemembers, families, and defense civilians, all while it deals with impacts on the defense industrial base \u2014 the Defense Department needs this new funding.\nDefense spending in the stimulus totals $10.5 billion, with likely more to come later. Of this, $1 billion is allocated to the Defense Production Act (DPA), and the bill waives several restrictions to supercharge it for pandemic recovery. Other priorities include $1.5 billion for working capital funds, $1.2 billion for uniformed personnel, $2 billion for Operations and Maintenance, nearly $5 billion for the Defense Health Program, and $2.8 million for the Armed Forces Retirement Home.\nThis funding demands strident supervision. Mark Cancian from the Center for Strategic and International Studies explained that the Defense Department\u2019s original request for supplemental emergency funds involved the creation of a \u201Cslush fund.\u201D Congress rejected the concept and used various provisions to strike a helpful balance between the immediate funding needs of the U.S. military . #tangibles #tangibles2020 #reparations #reparations2020","NumberOfLikes":187,"Hashtags":["#PresidentTrump","#wartime","#pandemic","#SenateMajorityLeader","#MitchMcConnell","#coronavirus","#COVId19)","#invisibleenemy,\u201D🤣🤣","#warsinIraq","#Afghanistan","#taxpayer roughly","#tangibles","#tangibles2020","#reparations","#reparations2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":6,"Timestamp":1598149138,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 04:18:58 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"***(For those wondering about our home renovation,  priorities shifted; delaying progress.

I love Palm trees and am thankful every time I see one. (I change the sign and font often) With limited socializing, and minimal activities, these jars have more significance than ever.

Still, like so many families, we had planned a beautiful wedding for our daughter. The Pandemic meant it couldn\u2019t be held at the resort, as we envisioned. ***Two weeks prior to their date, we experienced the sad, sudden loss of our thirty-eight year-old family member, a handsome, loving Dad to his daughter age five, and his son, age six. He was fit and never knew he had heart trouble. For his loving wife, our Cousin, her world has been turned upside down. It\u2019s inconceivable.

Us 90's babies were hyped and joined in on the memes.\n\nHere's how I imagine the suit would look like if used as protection rather than the medical grade PPEs. Anatomically incorrect and weirdly proportioned COVID-19 Ranger ready for battle. Hahahaha...\n\nOn a more serious note, our world is crumbling. CoVid cases are dangerously increasing, businesses are declaring bankruptcy, people are losing their jobs and single use plastic wastes are piling up. If I constantly think about all of these and everything else, there's no way I could have a good night sleep every night. Even my waking hours will be perturbed. We should be scared about our future. I know I am.\n\nSo, what should we do?\n\n#illustrate #illustration #lettering #art #drawing #pendrawing #sketch #character #covid19 #pandemic #powerranger #meme","NumberOfLikes":14,"Hashtags":["#illustrate","#illustration","#lettering","#art","#drawing","#pendrawing","#sketch","#character","#covid19","#pandemic","#powerranger","#meme"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Jewdryna on August 22, 2020.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598144265,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 02:57:45 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"You guys.

Las clases de maquillaje son para reuniones en 𝙕𝙤𝙤𝙢 o 𝙁𝙖𝙘𝙚𝙏𝙞𝙢𝙚, porque finalmente, ¿qué marca querría promocionar un labial, si las mujeres andarán con tapabocas?\n_\n@sephora canceló todos sus servicios en tienda y dirigió su público al Mercado online (𝙘𝙤𝙣 𝙚𝙣𝙫𝙞̨𝙤𝙨 𝙜𝙧𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙨), @morphebrushes envió notas prohibiendo a sus clientes y empleados a no usar los productos 𝙩𝙚𝙨𝙩𝙚𝙧 (de prueba) mientras dure la pandemia. Y es que aunque los datos que se han ofrecido solo reflejan el tiempo de duración del virus en superficies duras, aún los laboratorios estudian si se adhiere a gels, cremas o labiales que no tengan alcohol.\n_\nMuchas de estas firmas coinciden que sus procedimientos van a cambiar, aunque muchas de ellas también esperan a ver cómo reaccionará cada sector. Por ejemplo, mientras en #EEUU las ventas cayeron 58% en Marzo comparado con las ventas del 2.019, en #Mexico para Abril las ventas han subido un 24%, según la Asociación Mexicana de Ventas Online (AMVO) y sólo las sobrepasan los alimentos, artículos de cuidado diario y antibacteriales.\n_\nAún tenemos mucho tiempo para seguir pensando y evaluando cómo sería avanzar en nuestra cotidianidad, mientras aprovechemos el tiempo para evaluar nuestros productos, brochas, cremas milagrosas y más, cómo también:. ¿Cuánto tiempo llevan esos productos en el baño sin usar? ¿La limpieza del estuche de maquillaje? \u2026entre otras cosas.\n_\n@absoluedu\n#covid19 #coronavirus #pandemic #makeup #inspiration #late #opinion #top #like #love #absolutedu #motivation #EEUU #Venezuela","NumberOfLikes":17,"Hashtags":["#Repost","#EEUU","#Mexico","#covid19","#coronavirus","#pandemic","#makeup","#inspiration","#late","#opinion","#top","#like","#love","#absolutedu","#motivation","#EEUU","#Venezuela"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Amomakeup - Maquillaje Cejas on August 22, 2020.
