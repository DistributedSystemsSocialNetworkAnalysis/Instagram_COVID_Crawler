The forms (made from clay and painted paper-board) reflect the haphazard array of satellite dishes, antenna, skylights, vents, barbed wire, graffiti, etc., she says, \"that mark the landscape my eyes glaze over on my daily commute.\"\n\nWe want to see, hear, feel, support your art and response to this moment.

After rain out at Starke, we went to Texas State University. It was a course we havent played yet. The udisc app was very helpful in navigating the course, as the signage was pretty much non existence. The first couple holes play right along a very busy, loud road. Then the course goes into technical tight woods. After that, into the campus, then back out towards the road along the parking garages. There is some fair and birdiable holes, and some not so much. There is a lot of up and down and side hill, along with guardian trees, low ceilings, and tunnel shots to provide a great mix and challenging course. Also there is multiple different basket types. There is some DGA, Discatcher, and some other randoms. The teepads are mostly dirt (mud today). If you are in the San Marcos area, give your self a challenge.\n\nPandemic Disc Golf Apparel.

The flow got you to where you are, now you have to exit the ride and start a walk back, alone, that is a solo, unique journey. No one can walk it for you, it is much more uncomfortable than just status quo living (whatever that was for us). So, when you are faced with heavy, weighty feelings and periods of anxiety and depression because you are waking up to truth and choosing better for yourself, be thankful and comforted in knowing this is part of processing and healing. You will come through it, it\u2019s part of the journey. This doesn\u2019t mean ruminating endlessly, but sitting with feelings, not running from thoughts and ideas and zoning out. Dealing with the questions and conclusions and accepting them for the truths they are. Being there with yourself as you go along this road is the best thing you can do\u2014you are getting somewhere. Letting emotions come up and be felt and acknowledged, understanding your past in new ways, wanting and yearning for more in the future\u2014let your soul process this, all of it. What awaits on the other side is a new level of being. And this process continues as long as we partner with it. üíú #womanreleased #emotionalabuse #emotionalhealth #awakening #codependencyrecovery #narcissisticabuse #covertabuse #trauma #gaslighting #cptsd #selfhealers #worldhealers #pandemic x#sabbath #sabbathrest #spiritualabuse #reset #wakeup #repentance #truth #God #purpose #heal #lead #joinvoices #releasetheworld #jubilee #youarereleased #collectivetrauma #amplifylove","NumberOfLikes":3,"Hashtags":["#womanreleased","#emotionalabuse","#emotionalhealth","#awakening","#codependencyrecovery","#narcissisticabuse","#covertabuse","#trauma","#gaslighting","#cptsd","#selfhealers","#worldhealers","#pandemic","#sabbath","#sabbathrest","#spiritualabuse","#reset","#wakeup","#repentance","#truth","#God","#purpose","#heal","#lead","#joinvoices","#releasetheworld","#jubilee","#youarereleased","#collectivetrauma","#amplifylove"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Womanreleased on August 22, 2020.

It can also infect humans and is known as Weil's disease. \n\nDon't believe the scare stories- if you have concerns regarding vaccinating your pet please speak to your vet who will be happy to discuss this with you... don't rely on Facebook groups or Instagram accounts that are spreading false rumours!\n\nThere are those who want to see a world with no vaccines. Well, this coronavirus pandemic has shown us what the world is like without just one specific vaccine. \n\nPlease share to spread the world - vaccines work!\n\n#vaccines #vaccineswork #science #medicine #epidemiology #scicomm #pandemic #covid19 #pets #animals #dogs #dogstagram #ilovemydog #cats #horses #veterinary #vetlife #vetmed #stbernard #health #healthylifestyle #natural #animalphotography #thatface #farming #veterinarian #puppy #fakenews #misinformation #naturalhealth","NumberOfLikes":2359,"Hashtags":["#vaccines","#vaccineswork","#science","#medicine","#epidemiology","#scicomm","#pandemic","#covid19","#pets","#animals","#dogs","#dogstagram","#ilovemydog","#cats","#horses","#veterinary","#vetlife","#vetmed","#stbernard","#health","#healthylifestyle","#natural","#animalphotography","#thatface","#farming","#veterinarian","#puppy","#fakenews","#misinformation","#naturalhealth"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Danny Chambers ü©∫ in Danny Chambers - Veterinary Surgeon with @danny_the_vet.

For 30 weeks & 4 days I\u2019ve kept you quiet. 30 weeks & 4 days for me to find the words, the strength to speak about you. I\u2019ve typed this & deleted it a million times. I\u2019ve spent hours wondering how to approach announcing you. I\u2019ve always strived to be honest, I\u2019ve never been one to sugarcoat or fake things. This has been different, harder than anything I\u2019ve ever faced. The thing is, I didn\u2019t want to be a mom. It\u2019s not who I was. There\u2019s such pressure on women, but when we\u2019re talking about pregnant women? It\u2019s a whole new world. I haven\u2019t been in a place where I could share my experience, my thoughts, my struggles. I\u2019ve been terrified of what my truth would look like to others, how I would be perceived. What judgment would I face for feeling how I feel? What unsolicited opinions & advice would I get? I wasn\u2019t ready for the \u201Ccongratulations\u201D, it\u2019s not what I felt. I\u2019m not your sunshine & rainbows pregnant woman. I have endless intrusive & terrifying thoughts, feelings, fears, pain, & mental struggles that I\u2019m desperately working through. Pregnancy in general is life rocking-but when I wasn\u2019t ready for it, through a pandemic, in the midst of a severe bipolar spiral-it wasn\u2019t what I signed up for this 2020. I have kept quiet for many reasons. 1. the shame & guilt society has driven women to feel surrounding pregnancy & 2. mentally I have been FAR from capable of handling everything, much less letting others in. I know there are women just like me, who feel just as alone, terrified, judged & like some horrible woman\/mother for feeling this way. For not wanting this. For not being thrilled about this. We\u2019re told we \u201Cshould be grateful\u201D & our pain & emotions are invalidated, as if being a mom, getting pregnant, that\u2019s every woman\u2019s dream. I want to share with them. So here it is. Baby boy, your daddy & I love you with everything that we are. I want you to be proud of me, of us-but I am scared. I am uncertain. I\u2019m not ready. I am struggling. Yet I am here. For you. Entirely. October 27th 2020, we will welcome you InshAllah & you will change us forever. \n#pregnancy #babyboy #pandemic #mentalhealthmatters","NumberOfLikes":952,"Hashtags":["#pregnancy","#babyboy","#pandemic","#mentalhealthmatters"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Morgan Miller Maksoud on August 22, 2020.","NumberOfComments":154,"Timestamp":1598125151,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 21:39:11 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Oprah\u2019s anti wrinkle cream. \n\nMade from human growth hormone and human foreskin. \n\nAs stated, and as listed on the products. \n\nüôÇüê∏\n\n\u2014- \u2014- \u2014- \u2014- \u2014- \u2014- \u2014- \n\u2022\nRepost from @slasherstorian\n\u2022\nBe Gone\n\u2014- \u2014- \u2014- \u2014- \u2014- \u2014- \u2014- \n\n#xposingtruth #savethechildren #saveourchildren #endhumantrafficking #wherearethechildren #pedo #virus #adrenochrome #thegreatawakening #truth #Qanon #Q #WWG1WGA #hoax #pandemic #nomasks #maskoff","NumberOfLikes":29,"Hashtags":["#xposingtruth","#savethechildren","#saveourchildren","#endhumantrafficking","#wherearethechildren","#pedo","#virus","#adrenochrome","#thegreatawakening","#truth","#Qanon","#Q","#WWG1WGA","#hoax","#pandemic","#nomasks","#maskoff"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1598125886,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 21:51:26 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Custom Disneyland attractions mask $10 shipped.

I thought about how much I miss Broadway. I never really realized how much until now.\nI miss everything. I miss posting whenever someone makes their debut in a track they cover. I miss geeking out with my family whenever I meet someone I look up to. I miss getting to stage door and telling some of my favorite performers how much I appreciate what they do. I miss getting 99¬¢ pizza with my dad before seeing a show. I miss getting up early to jump on a train to New York City. I miss waiting in the rush ticket lines in the morning. I miss feeling the energy of NYC as I walk around. I miss it all so much.\n\nThis photo was taken when I was waiting to get on a subway. It was almost 2 am. I was giddy from the day  Earlier, my dad and I went to see Dear Evan Hansen.  I told him I wanted to stop by Mean Girls to catch the actors after the show. All of the sudden, he surprised me with front row tickets to Mean Girls on Broadway! I was so elated that I was going to see one of my favorite shows of all time with my dad. He\u2019s the one whom I love talking to about all things Broadway. My family has been so supportive of my love of theatre. I love them and I\u2019m glad that I can spend time with them during this challenging situation.\n\nThe world has changed so much in the past year. Many people have gone through unimaginable hardship, and some have even lost their lives. When Broadway comes back, it will be so different than what we remember. There will be no stage dooring and no backstage tours. Everyone will have to wear masks at all times. The stage door is one of my favorite things about theatre. It was my chance to tell the performers how much their artistry meant to me. \n\nIf you can, please join me in donating to @theactorsfund. They help people in the arts pay their rent and get essentials. Every penny counts so please give if you can.\n\nI hope all of you are doing well and staying safe. üôÇ\n\nLove and blessings,\nAshley ‚ù§Ô∏è","NumberOfLikes":519,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ÀóÀèÀã Broadway ÀäÀéÀó in New York City Subway with @superha, @theactorsfund, @dearevanhansen, @flexitarianmd, @meangirlsbway, and @bemorechillmusical.

Their name was inspired by the best drink of the galaxy, the \u201EPangalactic Gargleblaster\u201C from Douglas Adams fabulous book \u201EThe Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy\u201C. Here you see them at one of the two starting points in 2019, in G√∂rlitz, Saxony, Germany. Unfortunately two of the teams were forced to stay at the (by the way awesome!) K√ºhlhaus-Campground because DHL was messing with us and not delivering our beloved hitch-packages in time. They were welcomed back to the race two days later in Krak√≥w, Poland. Sweet memories!\n\nDon\u2018t forget: Still Europe watches innocent people who are drowning in the mediterranean sea and still European states treat them inhumanely in Camps like Moria.

Much less likely to eat out and Uber eats and door dash bills surpass the wine store now. My general rule of thumb has been to never get a lobster roll from a grocery store because it would be a clawtastrophe and yet for the second time in a month I\u2019ve broken my own rule and was happy once again. Harbor Harvest in Huntington right near prime. It\u2019s kind of a hornet grocery store and deli combined. So when I saw lobster rolls on the menu I figured hey you only live once. The place has some clawbiance with tables on the harbor but took it home. $22.95 definitely a mice starting point as the price doesn\u2019t break the clawbank. Connecticut style with butter that always make me happy. Bread was huge and fries were big portion so don\u2019t eat this if you plan on activities or going out after because I\u2019m 30 minutes from food coma right now. My one clawtique is to not cut up the lobster into such small pieces because you get spillage while eating and I don\u2019t want lobster spilling out onto my shirt that I\u2019ve worn 3 days in a row working from home.

[2\/2]\n\nSmuggling gangs in Mexico have repeatedly sawed through new sections of President Trump's border wall in recent months by using commercially available power tools, opening gaps large enough for people and drug loads to pass through, according to U.S. agents and officials with knowledge of the damage.\n\nThe breaches have been made using a popular cordless household tool known as a reciprocating saw that retails at hardware stores for as little as $100.... After cutting through the base of a single bollard, smugglers can push the steel out of the way, allowing an adult to fit through the gap. Because the bollards are so tall -- and are attached only to a panel at the very top -- their length makes them easier to push aside once they have been cut and are left dangling, according to engineers consulted by The Washington Post.\n\nAsked about the revelations, Trump said he was unfamiliar with the revelations, though he quickly added, \"We have a very powerful wall. But no matter how powerful, you can cut through anything, in all fairness.... You can cut through any wall.\"\n\nThe president went on to say that after the barriers have been pierced, he's confident that officials can \"put the chunk back in\" -- after people have had an opportunity to go through it after using popular cordless household tools readily available in hardware stores.\n.\n.\n.\n#msnbc #thisisamerica #stevebannon #usacorruption #mexicanborder #trumpswall #coronavirus #covid19 #pandemic #stayhome #quarantine #abuseofpower #fucktrump #2020 \n\n‚òëÔ∏è ùóôùóºùóπùóπùóºùòÑ @sacredeyes_magazine #sacredeyes_magazine","NumberOfLikes":49,"Hashtags":["#msnbc","#thisisamerica","#stevebannon","#usacorruption","#mexicanborder","#trumpswall","#coronavirus","#covid19","#pandemic","#stayhome","#quarantine","#abuseofpower","#fucktrump","#2020","#sacredeyes_magazine"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1598116959,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 19:22:39 CEST 2020","Location":"Mexican Border"},{"CaptionText":"Mile 139 üö∏\n.\nAfter two weeks of school we haven\u2019t stop üõë missing the beach üèù the sun ‚òÄÔ∏è the sand, we\u2019ve been two weeks at it and this online thing it is absolutely annihilating us!

Want to find out more, check out the blurb and get your copy!!!!\n\n'Lockdown Life' is a humorous and reflective snapshot of the unique period called 'Lockdown'. 2020 brought us the great global event that resulted in seven billion people on the planet being sent to the confines of their homes amidst the pandemic, some to homes padded with toilet paper and others with cupboards full of dry pasta!\n\nSplit into three parts, this book is designed to help you spot 'Lockdown Personalities', explore 'Lockdown Activities' and reflect on 'Lockdown Lessons'. Did you know that the Lockdown Roadman\u2019s hobby of chatting up women outside Iceland was classed as \u2018essential work\u2019? Did you catch that glass of brandy your child\u2019s teacher was drinking off-screen during the English lesson on Shakespeare?\n\nLockdown made introverts (Intros) scream with joy and extroverts (Extros) quake in their boots as they were forced out of the pubs and clubs. It made parents appreciate teachers and the public appreciate the NHS, and some tapped into gifts and talents they didn\u2019t even know they had. But what can we gain from this time? Can humanity learn and grow?\n\nDive in and join us as we explore love, laughter and freedom amongst one of the most challenging times of humanity.\n\n#lockdown #lockdownlife","NumberOfLikes":22,"Hashtags":["#lockdown","#lockdownlife"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by consciousdreamspublishing on August 22, 2020.

What Unfriended did was pretty original but it lacked execution and I just wasn\u2019t that impressed. Host on the other hand somehow manages to impresses me with its filmmaking. Host is actually a really fucking good movie. It centres around these six friends who summon a demonic spirit during an online seance. The whole film is shot on iPhones and laptops and was actually filmed during the pandemic. They give little nods in the beginning of the whole pandemic which I thought was a really cool detail to add and explains why they chose to do this seance online rather than in person. The movie is also incredibly short. Runs at 56 minutes which is really a short in a way but this worked for me so well. It wasn\u2019t dragged on for another 20 minutes. This is the length the film needed to be and to my my surprise this is probably the scariest film I\u2019ve seen in all of 2020. It\u2019s incredibly √≠nstense and doesn\u2019t utilize jump scares as much for its scares. It utilizes the characters laptops and phones to capture the scare as if you\u2019re actually there with them in the zoom call watching it go down with them. The film is very quiet when it needs to be and when it is thats when its scariest. I\u2019m incredibly impressed with how this film was executed. They filmed this movie with their laptops and phones and they managed to pull off big scare set pieces with people being pulled across rooms, people flying through the air outside and landing in pools, people being lit on fire, cabinets and chairs flying all over the rooms, it\u2019s impressive. It was well executed and very terrifying. I recommend y\u2019all give this a try. Download Shudder and get the free trial and just watch it. If you\u2019re a horror fan you will be pleased with Host. \nFilm Rating 7.5\/10 \n#filmsforfreaks #movies #films #tvshows #reviews #moviereviews #cinema #host #shudder #pandemic #horror #scary","NumberOfLikes":14,"Hashtags":["#103","#filmsforfreaks","#movies","#films","#tvshows","#reviews","#moviereviews","#cinema","#host","#shudder","#pandemic","#horror","#scary"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Love For The Film Industry on August 22, 2020 tagging @shudder.

For many people, being sick with COVID-19 would be a little bit like having the flu. People can get a fever, cough, or have a hard time taking deep breaths. Most people who have gotten COVID-19 have not gotten very sick. Only a small group of people who get it have had more serious problems.\nIf you do get sick, it doesn\u2019t mean you have COVID-19. People can get sick from all kinds of germs. What\u2019s important to remember is that if you do get sick, the adults at home will help get you any help that you need.\nIf you suspect your child may have COVID-19, call the healthcare facility to let them know before you bring your child in to see them.\n.\nBe smart.

I had to take several days off from my walks. Not only was I incredibly fatigued but I was in a lot of pain. It has taken me a good 10 days to heal from it. Now I am feeling great and have more energy. I walked my usual distance this morning, and am startlingly close to reaching the next village (virtual) of Zibiri. So that means a good Spanish meal this week! Oh, and I also got my first tattoo to celebrate ending the first phase of treatment. I have never wanted one before but an experience like this has a way of making you do things you never thought you'd do. The quote reminds me of how Paul McCartney wrote the song \"Let It Be\" when his mother came to him in a dream and told him the fights with his band mates would be OK,  just let it be. This echoes my own personal dream experience and reminds me to just breathe and let God's will be done.\n*\n*\n*\n*\n#locustforkriver #tinyhouse #ecoretreat #sustainability #letitbe #eco #superhost #thebeatles #pandemic #camping #glamping #cancertreatment #cabin #cancer #alabamathebeautiful #cancersucks #onlyinalabama #caserockcabin  #strsharesunday #thisisalabama  #birminghamalabama #offgrid #offgridliving #rectalcancer #offgridarchitecture #mogmountain  #paulmccartney #airbnb #airbnbhost #tincanatcaserock","NumberOfLikes":125,"Hashtags":["#locustforkriver","#tinyhouse","#ecoretreat","#sustainability","#letitbe","#eco","#superhost","#thebeatles","#pandemic","#camping","#glamping","#cancertreatment","#cabin","#cancer","#alabamathebeautiful","#cancersucks","#onlyinalabama","#caserockcabin","#strsharesunday","#thisisalabama","#birminghamalabama","#offgrid","#offgridliving","#rectalcancer","#offgridarchitecture","#mogmountain","#paulmccartney","#airbnb","#airbnbhost","#tincanatcaserock"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":17,"Timestamp":1598107945,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 16:52:25 CEST 2020","Location":"Case Rock Cabin"},{"CaptionText":"@michael_rangel11 @nayenaye22 @madison_martin15 @kris10knott @brian.ramos.353  #ICURN #nurse #COVID #pandemic #youredeadtous #framily","NumberOfLikes":28,"Hashtags":["#ICURN","#nurse","#COVID","#pandemic","#youredeadtous","#framily"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Kayla North on August 22, 2020.

As well as the health benefits of simply getting outside in the sunshine and fresh air; it\u2019s a game changer. \n\nThe virus has asked us to slow down. It\u2019s closed us off and closed us in. However, many have sought solace in discovering nature. Maybe they\u2019ve checked out a new park, a new trail, went camping for the first time, etc. The possibilities are endless. \n\nWhile Covid-19 has brought the world to its knees its also made us aware of how we need to rise up in more ways than one. \n\nWe can continually practice gratitude by looking towards the positives of life rather than the negatives. Many things have closed, remain closed or you choose to stay at home for your own personal reasons, but nature is still there. It\u2019s right outside your door.

Lord Ganesha is considered as the demolisher of obstacles and the God of wisdom, knowledge, and prosperity. And it is believed that his body and possessions symbolize various spiritual aspects. So we decided to give the traditional Ganesh depiction a little science twist. Here\u2019s what each part represents:\n\nNeuron represents the large head and trunk of the Lord symbolizing great wisdom and intelligence. \n\nThe lungs represent the ears. It serves as a reminder of the ongoing pandemic. As the COVID-19 virus primarily affects the lungs, it is essential to take all the necessary precautions to protect our lungs. \n\nThe large stomach is represented by an adipocyte or fat cell. Here, the adipocyte reflects the effect of lockdown on our fat deposits. \n\nThe mucous cell represents the left hand of the Lord. It symbolizes protection. The mucous cells produce mucus which protects the cells lining the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract. \n\nThe right-hand side shows a neutrophil engulfing a pathogen.

The current controversy is in regards to reopening Ontario schools amid a pandemic vs safety of students. The critique is that not enough money is being invested to ensure safety, while the government expects class sizes to increase. There are homes with immunocompromised people who can be at risk with their children leaving and coming back from school, as well, if they choose virtual learning, it may do a disservice to students whose learning needs may not be met through this method. Young people with additional support needs in schools may also not recieve the support both in school and of course virtually. We should let parents decide what they would like to do and not judge them. This is a complicated decision. Not only is this entire process affecting children and parents, but there are other factors at play such as some parents not having the ability to make the decision they want to make because they will not have the funds to watch their children at home due to having to return to precarious working routines. Poverty, social class, and even race and other identity nuances will definitely impact the ability to make decisions or be forced into a decision (which is not a decision at all). #pandemic #children #backtoschool #covod19 #flashback @globalnews @globalnewsto #tv","NumberOfLikes":43,"Hashtags":["#pandemic","#children","#backtoschool","#covod19","#flashback","#tv"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Phoenix Rising on August 22, 2020.
