He tested positive for the coronavirus towards the end of July. He recounts that fateful day when he got the call from a health centre. He said that his friends were with him at that time. He was called three times and when the person in the line said his swab test was positive, he got nervous. His friends dismissed it and told him that it might be a prank call. Another friend told him that he saw a post on social media where his name was listed as one of the people who tested positive. This private information was leaked to the public. When he was approached by officials if he wanted to reveal his identity to aid in contact tracing, he agreed. Jay didn\u2019t inform his family about the result of the test. While his sister found out through the leaked information via social media, Jay kept it secret from his parents, fearing that they will worry for him. The only time his parents knew that he had to be brought to an isolation unit was when he was already fit to be discharged. He considers his recovery as a second lease on life. \u201CBaka madami pa akong gagawin dito sa mundo,\u201D he said.

My usual inner monologues did not do it for me anymore so I decided to start fresh somehow. And so I quit a job I\u2019ve held for a few years and decided to go backpacking for a bit before I started working at my new job. I went to Malapascua for a few days with a couple of friends and then headed here, in Panagsama Beach, by myself. This has always been my happy place. Because even if it\u2019s become so familiar to me (it\u2019s my go-to place when I need a breather) every time I come here feels like the very first time. I feel anonymous and safe. I\u2019m glad I took those trips. It helped me gain a better perspective on things and create a roadmap for my self-improvement project. And I went into my new job with an improved outlook on things. But then, shit hit the fan and I don\u2019t think anyone has foreseen the shit that\u2019s happened in a span of just a few weeks. Fast-forward to today and everybody is still in some form of isolation everywhere. In situations like this, I would have just said fuck it and leave all the happy things I made to keep myself up undone but somehow, I managed to talk myself out of spiraling down again and I was able to hold on to the positive vibes I gained when this year started. I don\u2019t think we can get back to being completely carefree when this is all over, the world will, indeed, never be the same but one thing I know is that pockets of paradise like Panagsama Beach will remain unchanged and will be there to welcome us back again and give us a much needed breather. \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n#travel #traveling #justbreathe #instatravel #instago #mentalhealth #breather #travelling #instapassport #instatraveling #mytravelgram #travelgram #pandemic #igtravel #pilipinas #philippines #wanderlust #explore #traversephilippines #panagsamabeach #pilipinas #islandvibes #beach #backpacking #islandlife #thepharchipelago #goodvibes #wheninmoalboal #paradise #tropical","NumberOfLikes":20,"Hashtags":["#travel","#traveling","#justbreathe","#instatravel","#instago","#mentalhealth","#breather","#travelling","#instapassport","#instatraveling","#mytravelgram","#travelgram","#pandemic","#igtravel","#pilipinas","#philippines","#wanderlust","#explore","#traversephilippines","#panagsamabeach","#pilipinas","#islandvibes","#beach","#backpacking","#islandlife","#thepharchipelago","#goodvibes","#wheninmoalboal","#paradise","#tropical"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Freddina Ho in Panagsama Beach.

Apasih Virtual Fashion Show itu? Virtual Fashion Show sama seperti fashion show pada umumnya, tetapi dilakukan secara virtual. Pandemi Covid-19 memberikan dampak yang besar bagi perekonomian Indonesia pada banyak sektor, tak terkecuali industri fashion Indonesia. Namun, dengan adanya pandemi ini bukan berarti menjadi penghalang untuk tidak melakukan apapun. Dengan berfikir kreatif dan adaptif, kita mampu untuk dapat memunculkan ide baru.\n----\nDengan memanfaatkan green screen atau layar hijau yang dilengkapi dengan visual digital, lighting yang cukup, dll virtual fashion show dapat berlangsung dengan menarik. Bisa dibuat dengan sederhana dari rumah atau studio yang memungkinkan para pelaku usaha fashion untuk bisa melakukan fashion show secara mandiri, sampai yang lebih bagus lagi dengan layanan live-streaming atau mengedit video semenarik mungkin sehingga semakin bisa menarik dan lebih dinikmati publik. \n----\nVirtual fashion show memiliki keuntungan yaitu dapat menghemat biaya bagi pihak penyelenggara yang dapat dilakukan dimana saja dan kapan saja tanpa membutuhkan area pagelaran yang luas. Di era new normal,  ini adalah kesempatan untuk pelaku usaha untuk bisa kreatif dan adaptif untuk lebih maksimal lagi dalam memasarkan produk. Tetapi, tantangannya juga lebih banyak, karena semua persiapan dan komunikasi dikerjakan dari rumah, lewat video call misalnya dan juga berfikir bagaimana cara mengemas dan menyajikannya ke publik sehingga bisa diterima dengan baik.\n----\nSemua produk kami bisa didapatkan di berbagai marketplace. Seperti Blibli, Tokopedia, Shopee, zilingotrade.id dan masih banyak lagi.

Murmu writes.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has devastated many lives and livelihoods around the world, but in India, the challenges have perhaps been the most formidable to its health system and its workers. Prime Minister Narendra Modi underscored this when he announced a complete lockdown across the country on March 24 and said, \u201CThink about the doctors, nurses, paramedical staff, pathologists who are working day and night in hospitals to save each and every life. Think about hospital administration staff, ambulance drivers, ward boys, sanitation workers who are working to serve others in these difficult condition.\u201D He also asked for the people to pray for personnel engaged in the delivery of essential and emergency services (e.g. police, fire service, garbage collectors, etc.).\n\nIn fact, the Centre on April 21 launched a portal \u2013 at covidwarriors.gov.in \u2013 to maintain a database of healthcare professionals and volunteers, including ASHA workers and anganwadi workers, and claimed 1.24 crore such individuals were available in the country. The portal is meant to help local administrations and state governments tackle COVID-19. The number of infected and killed workers could be extrapolated from the COVID-19 positivity and fatality rates respectively. But these figures would be mere conjecture \u2013 not desirable substitutes for validated data.\n\nMore in link in bio.\n.\n.\n.\n\n#india #indianpolitics #covid19 #coronavirus #pandemic #gocoronago #maskoff #lockdown #unlock #healthcare #medicine #frontlineworkers #essentialworkers #medicalprofessionals #doctors #nurses #hospitalworkers #hospital #treatment #death #sacrifice #optics #bjp #bharatiyajanataparty #modi #namo #thaalibajaao #diajalaao #essentialservices #lifesaving","NumberOfLikes":3012,"Hashtags":["#india","#indianpolitics","#covid19","#coronavirus","#pandemic","#gocoronago","#maskoff","#lockdown","#unlock","#healthcare","#medicine","#frontlineworkers","#essentialworkers","#medicalprofessionals","#doctors","#nurses","#hospitalworkers","#hospital","#treatment","#death","#sacrifice","#optics","#bjp","#bharatiyajanataparty","#modi","#namo","#thaalibajaao","#diajalaao","#essentialservices","#lifesaving"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The Wire on August 22, 2020.

Or that\u2019s what I realised when I started working on a story to decode how the pandemic is changing protest culture around the world. \n\nFrom #Russia to #Brazil, #Belarus to #Colombia, #Poland, #Lebanon, #Israel, #Thailand, #Germany, and #USA, angry populations are stepping onto the streets, with little regard to social distancing restrictions to push back against oppressive governments. It's not that citizens weren't angry before. Global protests witnessed a historic high last year, before the pandemic made the world eerily silent.  It's just that the anger has now metamorphosed into righteous rage. \n\nWhile the lockdown saw people experimenting with creative ways of protest ( think: banging pots and pans in Brazil or striking from their cars in Poland), they are back now to reclaiming the streets.\n\nAnd sure the way people are protesting look different in different countries, and their direct causes also vary, but the underlying reasons are the same:  a rage against the presiding political class, and a deep desire to have more say in things that shape their daily lives. Economics, definitely, has a huge role to play, but concern about the pandemic and its economic impact is far from the demonstrators\u2019 only issue. Dominating protesters\u2019 minds are things such as lack of economic opportunity, perceptions of rising inequality, and corruption by elites. Protesters are also worried about civil rights, racism, immigration, abortion, uneven access to healthcare, homelessness, and lack of basic government services.\n\nIt\u2019s not a surprise that many of these protests are led by young people, who feel the system is especially rigged against them, with an older generation making all decisions, whose fall out they would have to suffer through. In a recent op-ed, an 18-year-old climate activist wrote, \u201CMy generation is giving up our youth \u2014 our schooling, our fun and our freedom \u2014 so that you can see next year. When this [Covid-19 crisis] is over, you may have to keep giving something up so that we can see the next century.\u201D \n\n<to read the story, head to the link in bio >\n\nüì∑ :@afpphoto","NumberOfLikes":65,"Hashtags":["#Russia","#Brazil,","#Belarus","#Colombia,","#Poland,","#Lebanon,","#Israel,","#Thailand,","#Germany,","#USA,"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1598077664,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 08:27:44 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"norma9367","CaptionText":"#coronavirus #plandemic2020 #pandemic #virus #health #life #you #freedom #peace #world #ourcountry #unitedkingdom","NumberOfLikes":2,"Hashtags":["#coronavirus","#plandemic2020","#pandemic","#virus","#health","#life","#you","#freedom","#peace","#world","#ourcountry","#unitedkingdom"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Norma A on August 21, 2020.","NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1598077655,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 08:27:35 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"nomorepsycopaths","CaptionText":"#psycopathfree #nomorepsycopaths #redflag #pandemic","NumberOfLikes":0,"Hashtags":["#psycopathfree","#nomorepsycopaths","#redflag","#pandemic"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @nomorepsycopaths on August 21, 2020.

This in response to new infections in New Zealand after 102 days without any infection. The amount of active cases is said to be 111 (22 aug). Out of four alert levels the city of Auckland is at level 3 and the rest of NZ is at level 2 (level 4 is full lockdown). The cases are positively tested with the PCR test that is not fit to detect COVID-19. There is no gold standard test for COVID-19. There are no distinctive specific symptoms for COVID-19, so the PCR test can't serve as a valid gold standard. Only virus isolation can be the golden standard (COVID-19 has never been isolated and purified). \"The tests can detect genetic sequences of viruses, but not viruses themselves\" (John Lauritsen - Has Provincetown Become Protease Town?). So, does the virus even exist? Are the cases just the flu? Who knows? But despite this uncertainty, our governments treat this situation like a new plague and give birth to freedom inhibiting laws, turning us more and more into China everyday. They will continue in that direction if we won't do anything about it. It's time for civil disobedience and to infect others with our knowledge.\n\nMain source used: COVID-19 PCR Tests are Scientifically Meaningless - Torsten Engelbrecht and Konstantin Demeter.\nAlso interesting to read: \"Faith in Quick Test Leads to Epidemic That Wasn't\" - New York Times article about quick and highly sensitive molecular tests (PCR being used as an example) leading to false alarms. \"But their very sensitivity makes false positives likely, and when hundreds or thousands of people are tested...false positives can make it seem like there is an epidemic\".\n\n#covid19 #cov19 #sarscov2 #pandemic #epidemic #military #vaccines #lockdown #pcrtest #newzealand #auckland #billgates #pcr #quarantine #jacindaardern #ardern #realnews #nonewnormal #scamdemic #scamdemic2020 #plandemic2020 #nwo #newworldorder","NumberOfLikes":0,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#cov19","#sarscov2","#pandemic","#epidemic","#military","#vaccines","#lockdown","#pcrtest","#newzealand","#auckland","#billgates","#pcr","#quarantine","#jacindaardern","#ardern","#realnews","#nonewnormal","#scamdemic","#scamdemic2020","#plandemic2020","#nwo","#newworldorder"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598070123,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 06:22:03 CEST 2020","Location":"Auckland New Zealand MTC"},{"Owner":"graciousvictories","CaptionText":"Are you ready to launch or re- launch your mission?\n\nMany ladies we've connected with lately have expressed their desire to be more present and improve their wellness.

For it what it failed to deliver most of the time, I was able to find little nuggets of entertainment here and there, most notably in its rather vague messages and ideas regarding violence, control and domestic abuse as well as the long shadow that it casts over whomever. I would say more about how it lives up to its promised plight of destruction in the final act and some merit in the photography and atmosphere presented but that\u2019s about where i draw the line because for all the praise it\u2019s been getting, there\u2019s not much to this. There\u2019s thrills but not a lot of investment.\u2063\n\u2063\nJenna Lyng Adams, who also stars as the best aspect of the film portraying the main character, tries to make something out of the fake pandemic in the movie but - as scriptwriter - she doesn't give herself enough room to maneuver let alone contribute it to the situations that surround and cloud the main character despite having LITERALLY all the character development. The reminder of the specific pandemic setting fades the more we focus on the predicaments regarding each unfleshed out character that the film wants you to fill in the blanks for (not that I mind). Performances aren't consistently strong enough to enliven the action that\u2019s promised in the final act and the worldbuilding is rather strictly limited beside the possibilities that are just not taken advantage of. Yes, there are a few scenes here and there that take advantage of the film\u2019s style that captures the pandemic angle to a substantial level of competence but this happens so infrequently that it\u2019s almost borderline pointless.\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\nI've seen a lot of slow films that worked in the past but that\u2019s only if the project has enough material to build itself off of and work with. Scenes that are there for a reason, they have to establish something: characters, their relations, build up the atmosphere; anything to avoid filler and no waste time. That unfortunately is what this film does to the letter: waste my f\u2019n time.","NumberOfLikes":19,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Darius French in Saint Simons Island, Georgia with @nailahsharese, @teeitbug, @naoyuki_1995, @imjamesshaw, @carlos.gabriel1968, @redrumflix, @bfittsyy, @buy_black_friday, @the_cinematic_connoissuer, @mattreviewsthings, @fishnfilms, @duluvamills, @makarov_moviereviews, @asp123thedream, @optimistic_critic_reviews, @pownallmoviereviews, @victoriaroseblog, and @quick_reviewer287.

I want to tell you that today marks my one month as a VEGETARIAN!!\n\u2022\nThis pandemic has been a journey of self awareness. Reaching low points in my life to then finding the right mindset for myself to push forward thinking. Becoming a vegetarian was one of those shifts for me and the many others I\u2019m working on. I knew some major changes needed to happen, and this has been one that I can play the role in my very own kitchen. We\u2019ve all been limited to our social outings and those we wish to spend time with, which was a huge source of happiness for so many of us. Instead, I\u2019ve worked on ways to better myself with what I consume. And it\u2019s radically making a difference internally and externally.\nAnd with every change, there are challenges! Like sharing a pepperoni pizza and getting so distracted that you forget to take off the pepperonis, or going camping and the one item on the menu is Annie\u2019s mac and cheese with Bacon, \u201Cat least it\u2019s organic?\u201D There are tribulations, but it\u2019s fun to see how you react! And the feeling of overcoming that craving is something special!\n\u2022\nI want you to think of one thing you\u2019ve been wanting to change in your life. And do it. Simply do it, give it a try! Involve that change in your routine for two weeks and see how it will shift your mindset and perceptions in the world. This is something I\u2019m working on as well. I\u2019m slowly but surely changing back to some normalcy, but this time even better than before, and I want to see that for you! ‚ú® happy Friday and enjoy your weekend! \nAnd of course, go Blazers!!! üèÄ (Also, thanks for sticking with me through so many name changes! I think I found the one! Haha)","NumberOfLikes":42,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Maddy McKay in Portland, Oregon with @soulpancake, and @chopra.

This is a close-up of one of our defenses against COVID-19, Soap! Magnified approximately 250 times, the mezmerising colours come about due to thin film interference. This happens when a film is thin enough (on the order of the wavelength of light). Light reflecting off the top and bottom surfaces of the double-layered lipid film superimpose, enhancing or suppressing different colours depending on the thickness or optical path length. Water gushing around inside of the bilayer causes the coloured patterns to evolve with time. Where the film is extremely thin, it appears as black as the cosmic abyss. \n\nThe photography is of particular importance not only as scienceart and science education but also during these frightening times of the COVID-19 Pandemic. The rainbow colours represent the colours of support to primary health care workers. \n\nThank you to Kevin Kendle for the kind permission to use his music for the background.

Please make sure to fill out the questionnaire about your past and current history regarding your health so your professional can view it before starting the session. Go to @fitnessprolive on instagram, and book the day, time and specific service (personal training, yoga, nutritional advice, physical therapy and mental coaching) that you would like to receive. \n\nWhy are we doing this:\n\nBeing healthy is the reason we\u2019re able to get out of bed in the morning, go to work, play with our kids and more. Our health dictates what we can do, and how much we can do of it. Without it, sometimes we can\u2019t even start our day. Exercising is essential to be able to live a long and healthy life, and without it our freedom of being physically and mentally active is at risk. \n\nCovid 19 has made it impossible for people to live healthy and steady lives physically, mentally and economically. With the spread getting worse all around the world, people's livelihood will continue to be affected. \n\nWhen I had cancer, I had the opportunity to feel what it was like not having enough energy or motivation to go to the gym or being so weak that I couldn't perform a push-up or a lunge. I was too afraid of being in the gym sometimes because somebody might see the catheter hanging from my neck. You don\u2019t have to have cancer to experience these things, there are other circumstances that put people in similar situations. And it always helps to have alternatives suggested for you if you\u2019re struggling trying to find a way out on your own. Some people need an outlet during this pandemic, and exercise for some is the medicine. \n\n#freeonlinetraining #clients #trainathome #fitnessapp #client #trainanywhereatanytime #covid19 #onlinetraining #virtualtrainer #fitnessprofessional #fitnessprolive #kfitathleticperformance #pandemic #fitnessprofessionals #quarintine #exerciseathome","NumberOfLikes":11,"Hashtags":["#freeonlinetraining","#clients","#trainathome","#fitnessapp","#client","#trainanywhereatanytime","#covid19","#onlinetraining","#virtualtrainer","#fitnessprofessional","#fitnessprolive","#kfitathleticperformance","#pandemic","#fitnessprofessionals","#quarintine","#exerciseathome"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1598048359,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 00:19:19 CEST 2020","Location":"Stockholm, Sweden"},{"Owner":"tera620","CaptionText":"Anybody can \u201CDo it for the \u2018gram\u201D, but this is what a real day in the life of Dr. Giese looks like #NoMakeUp #PhysicalTherapist #PT #DPT #FemaleDoctor #Pandemic #Covid19 #N95 #FaceMask #ScubLife #ICantBreathe #FrontlineWorker","NumberOfLikes":204,"Hashtags":["#NoMakeUp","#PhysicalTherapist","#PT","#DPT","#FemaleDoctor","#Pandemic","#Covid19","#N95","#FaceMask","#ScubLife","#ICantBreathe","#FrontlineWorker"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Dr. Tera Giese, PT, DPTüë©üèº\u200D‚öïÔ∏è on August 21, 2020.

During this year, I kept visiting on assignment Northern Kenya on the lookout of the new massive swarms of locusts invading and decimating vast areas of East Africa -worst locust invasion for more than 75 years-. Despite the spraying efforts, thousands of liters of pesticides have been delayed in reaching the region because of border closures caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The locust swarms and hopper bands keep destroying crops and invading grazing land like happened to Lochom Ekiru (65, first picture) a Turkana farmer who lost all his maize due to a massive band of hoppers invasion. Governments and UN agencies have repeatedly warned that the desert locust invasion will cause calamitous food shortages if not properly managed and controlled.\n\nPhoto and text by @luistatophoto\n\n#photography #photojournalism #documentaryphotography #reportage #reportagespotlight #kenya #eastafrica #locust #locusts #desertlocust #locustplague #invasion  #coronavirus #pandemic #everydaysocialjustice #everydayeverywhere #everydayafrica #onassignment #locustswarm #samburu #turkana #farming #isiolo #insects #insect #catastrophe #emergency #climatechange #documentary #climate","NumberOfLikes":303,"Hashtags":["#photography","#photojournalism","#documentaryphotography","#reportage","#reportagespotlight","#kenya","#eastafrica","#locust","#locusts","#desertlocust","#locustplague","#invasion","#coronavirus","#pandemic","#everydaysocialjustice","#everydayeverywhere","#everydayafrica","#onassignment","#locustswarm","#samburu","#turkana","#farming","#isiolo","#insects","#insect","#catastrophe","#emergency","#climatechange","#documentary","#climate"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1598047043,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 23:57:23 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"rjet77","CaptionText":"#kimono #kyototocatwalk #japan #japanese #victoriaandalbertmuseum #museum #kensington #london #outandabout #socialdistancing #staysafe #coronavirus #pandemic #2020 #covid19 #details #silk #cotton","NumberOfLikes":8,"Hashtags":["#kimono","#kyototocatwalk","#japan","#japanese","#victoriaandalbertmuseum","#museum","#kensington","#london","#outandabout","#socialdistancing","#staysafe","#coronavirus","#pandemic","#2020","#covid19","#details","#silk","#cotton"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Raja J...  rjet77 in Victoria and Albert Museum.

In the State of California, six people have passed away due to the fires. The hotspots of the fires are the East and South of San Francisco. The fires reportedly started after multiple lightning at times during a severe heat wave. Many building have burned down and nearly \n175 000 people are being forced to evacuate their homes. This is especially difficult when Coronavirus cases keep getting higher. Officials say that some of the fires have doubled in size. We pray for the people of California, and hope that the authorities are able to control the fires before they spread further. May God grant peace to the people who have lost their lives, and their homes in these horrible fires.\n\nCredits: @bbcnews \n\n#onestopnews #newsforyouth #news #update #youth #teen #usa #america #us #california #sanfrancisco #cali #wildfires #fire #evacuate #pandemic #corona #covid #rip #restinpeace","NumberOfLikes":17,"Hashtags":["#onestopnews","#newsforyouth","#news","#update","#youth","#teen","#usa","#america","#us","#california","#sanfrancisco","#cali","#wildfires","#fire","#evacuate","#pandemic","#corona","#covid","#rip","#restinpeace"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598043616,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 23:00:16 CEST 2020","Location":"California, USA"},{"Owner":"wilfredcollex","CaptionText":"üíØAVAILABLE NOW ..üî•üî• üåèüåèüì¨üìÆüì≠WORLDWIDE DELVERIES AND SELFPICKUP Available... _______\n üì®üì• EMS FEDX DHL POSTAL SERVICEüì¶üì¶&MORE \n_________ üìûCALL OR WHATSAPP FOR ORDER PLACEMENT & ENQUIRIES ‚òé +2348065310488\n\n________\n\nSIZES AVAILABLE.....\n_\n\n_________\n\n#polishgirl #fashiondesigner #fashion #fashionblogger #fashionblogger#instablog #collection #dubai #uba #ghanafashion #gucci #ny #football #versace#fendi #fashiondesigner #pandemic #america #canadagirls #usagirls #nigeria#egungunbecareful #fashionista #ghanagirls #fashionphotography #fashionworldwide#lockdown","NumberOfLikes":4,"Hashtags":["#polishgirl","#fashiondesigner","#fashion","#fashionblogger","#fashionblogge","#instablog","#collection","#dubai","#uba","#ghanafashion","#gucci","#ny","#football","#versac","#fendi","#fashiondesigner","#pandemic","#america","#canadagirls","#usagirls","#nigeri","#egungunbecareful","#fashionista","#ghanagirls","#fashionphotography","#fashionworldwid","#lockdown"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by WILFREDCOLLECTION R.C 2549869üÜó on August 21, 2020.

Spending this much time with your sweetheart can be a plus or a deal breaker. \n\nHere are a few things to consider so you don\u2019t  make a permanent decision over a temporary problem. Yes, temporary. This #pandemic may or may not last for another one to two years. And if you and your boo have invested some time in each other you may not want to call it quits too fast. Then again, you may. This can get lengthy so we will keep it sweet because the main concern is when to stay and when to go.\n\nWhen to call it quits:\n1. When your interactions become verbally and emotionally abusive. In this time of GREAT REVEAL or PAUSE. He or she may have been hiding an unresolved issue and being still forces them to face their issue. You are the target because you are in proximity. Definitely remind yourself it is not your fault and support him\/her if he\/she choose to seek support. \n2. Things turn violent. This can be women demonstrating violence towards men and vice versa. You may need healing or your partner does.\nWhen to stay:\n1. When you understand that you both are feeling overwhelmed because of the situation and not each other. if you both work from home, consider working in separate space for a few hours because personal time is important. \n2. When you understand that this too shall pass and these moments together could be exactly what you needed to take the relationship to another level. \nüëãCapture the beauty in this time. You may be saving your life or just finding it with that special soul. \n#lifestyle #inspiration #education #love #gradschool #relationshipgoals #nurses #nurselife #npstudent #thinklikeannp #npschool #nursepractitionerstudent #nextgeneration #covid19 #pandemiclove #newnormal #doublefeature","NumberOfLikes":14,"Hashtags":["#npstudents","#pandemic","#lifestyle","#inspiration","#education","#love","#gradschool","#relationshipgoals","#nurses","#nurselife","#npstudent","#thinklikeannp","#npschool","#nursepractitionerstudent","#nextgeneration","#covid19","#pandemiclove","#newnormal","#doublefeature"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by NP Student Magazineü©∫ on August 21, 2020.

All children born in Finland between October 1st, 1985 and August 31st, 1987, approximately 116,000 were randomized to receive 4 doses of the HiB vaccine (PPR-D, Connaught) starting at 3 months of life or one dose starting after 24 months of life. A control-cohort included all 128,500 children born in Finland in the 24 months prior to the HiB vaccine study. Non-obese diabetic prone (NOD) mice were immunized with a hemophilus vaccine to determine if immunization increased the risk of IDDM.\u2063\n\u2063\nResults: The difference in cumulative incidence between those receiving 4 doses and those receiving 0 doses is 54 cases of IDDM\/100,000 (P = 0.026) at 7 years, (relative risk = 1.26). Most of the extra cases of IDDM appeared in statistically significant clusters that occurred in periods starting approximately 38 months after immunization and lasting approximately 6-8 months. Immunization with pediatric vaccines increased the risk of insulin diabetes in NOD mice.\u2063\n\u2063\nConclusion: Exposure to HiB immunization is associated with an increased risk of IDDM.
