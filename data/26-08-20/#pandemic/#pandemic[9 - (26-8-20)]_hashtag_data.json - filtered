Gold can be purchased in the physical form or as an ETF.\n\nT-BILLS: These are debt securities that are backed by the U.S. government and are considered to be risk-free, as any principal invested is repaid by the government when the bill matures.\n\nDEFENSIVE STOCKS: utility, healthcare, biotechnology, and consumer goods companies, consumers will always purchase food, health products, and basic home supplies.

The APRU Multi-hazards Symposium 2019 focused on exploring the interrelationship between disasters and development at the local, national, and global levels as well as understanding how disaster risk reduction (DRR) can best be applied to the future sustainable development of society. The Symposium explored the role of universities in delivering the objectives of the Sendai Framework for 2015-2030 and provided a great platform for the introduction of Architecture for Disaster Risk Reduction and Resilience Initiative to be presented to the experts in disaster risk reduction field. Dr. Osamu Murao, professor at the International Institute of Disaster Science and founder of the International Strategies for Disaster Mitigation Laboratory at Tohoku University and Associate Professor Takako Izumi, Director of the APRU Multi Hazards Summer Program attended the Symposium and presented ArcDR3 Initiative program and plans. #xLAB #IRIDeS #TohokuUniversity #UCLA #APRU #MIRAIKAN #Architecture #UrbanPlanning #urbandesign #Resilience #Communityplanning #ISO #sustainability #disastermitigation #disastermanagement #recovery #reconstruction #globalinitiative #COVID19 #pandemic #research #design #collaboration #education #proactivity #plan #architectureandurbandesignforriskreductionandresilience #arcdr3 #arcdr3initaitve","NumberOfLikes":4,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598038543,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 21:35:43 CEST 2020","Location":"Mexico City, Mexico"},{"CaptionText":"Roses that smell like roses. #roses #gardening #gardenlifeüå± #pandemic #greenthumb","NumberOfLikes":0,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Coco_365 in My Garden.

At first I thought they meant I shouldn\u2019t be walking around. It was early in the pandemic and everyone was nervous. After thinking about it I realized what they really meant\u2014it was anti-Asian harassment in the form of a microaggression. I knew by the scorn on his face.\n\nI was born in Malaysia and moved to Canada in the early 80s. I was one of two Asian kids at my high school, which had about 1,000 students. The other Asian was born in Canada. I tried to befriend him but he immediately rejected me. \u201CDon\u2019t talk to me, don\u2019t look at me,\u201D he said. \u201CYou don\u2019t exist.\u201D I understand now why he did that, it was self-preservation, because I\u2019m worse, I\u2019m an immigrant. But back then, small things like that constantly reminded me I\u2019m not like everyone else. The experience of being othered has been with me a long time. I\u2019m always wondering if I\u2019m good enough. There\u2019s even a point in my life I convinced myself I was white. It was easier.\n\nAs a gay, Asian male, I\u2019m very comfortable in my skin.

I envisioned it as the go-to neighborhood place for primary care needs and qualified medical care service, providing help seven days a week. ‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nDuring the H1N1 outbreak in 2009 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012, PromptMD and its staff supported the Hoboken residents. Since then, our goal to help the community has only grown more prominent. We have remained fully functioning during these tough times, facing the COVID-19 pandemic since its peak. It was not only my decision but also a combined effort of the group to be on the front line of our community's COVID response. We tested several thousands of patients in our offices.

I hope you find them helpful:)\n\nTip # 1. Be patient with the process. Don\u2019t expect everything to be perfect on the first day. This is distance learning and EVERYONE is learning for the first time how to navigate at the same time.\n\nTip # 2. Keep healthy snacks and refreshments around! This will help to keep your child\u2019s energy levels high enough to want to learn and engage!\n\nTip # 3. Think outside the box! If your child doesn\u2019t like the kitchen table try the couch, or coffee table! A place where there are few distractions is best!\n\nTip # 4. If your child is having a hard time with something make sure you address it with their teacher. My guess is that their teacher will appreciate it, after all you guys are a team. \n\nTip # 5. Give yourself time. Like a lot of time. This is not easy for anyone. Please remember to be kind to yourself. You got this!\n\nTip # 6. Be patient with your child. There are going to be times when they aren\u2019t listening. This is hard on them too. Try to have fun and know this isn\u2019t going to be forever.\n\nIf you have any additional Tips: please comment below!‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è\n\n#specialeducation\n#autumnsroadtodiscovery\n#virtual\n#covid19\n#pandemic\n#yougotthis\n#wegotthis\n#autism\n#autismawareness\n#autismacceptance\n#specialneeds\n#nonverbalautism\n#severe-autism\n#beauty\n#learningathome\n#autismblog\n#autismfamily\n#home\n#tips\n#havefun\n#friday\n#friyay\n#goodvibes\n#goodmorning\n#havefaith\n#haveagreatday\n#swing\n#sensoryplayideas","NumberOfLikes":232,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Autumns_Road_2_Discovery on August 21, 2020 tagging @autumns_road_2_discovery.

Here are some tricks that have been working for me. \n\n1. By wearing the mask as high as possible and having the glasses lay on top of it, the mask better contours around the nose and it causes not only less air to escape upward but the air that does travel up doesn't hit the lenses which would cause them to fog.\n\n2. A folded tissue can be placed between the mask and nose to not only create a better fit having less air escape upwards, but also to absorb the moistness in the air to protect the lenses from the fog. \n\n3. By washing with soap and water the lenses are covered by a thin film that acts as a surfactant to become more fog resistant. This layer lasts for about half an hour to one hour so it's a temporary fix. Maybe enough for a quick shopping spree?\n\n4. The snugger the top of the mask, the less moist air escaping upward to fog your glasses. You can tape it down or use a nose wire to really pat the mask down which allows the exhaled air to escape down and out rather than up.\n\nOther tips:\n-- when wearing the glasses push them further away from your face\n-- try an #antifog spray\n-- wear contact lenses and avoid this situation completely\n\n#fog #maskwithglasses #mask #covid #coronavirus\n#glasses #fogessentials #blogger #blog #covid_19 \n#MANIM #facemask #glasses #pandemic #maskon\n#protectyourself #maske #cdc #masked #muslimbloggers\n#philly #sisters #pakistanibloggers","NumberOfLikes":16,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by MANIM on August 21, 2020.

We went from business as usual when I signed the offer letter to full shutdown by my start date. Moving during the pandemic required continual adjustments as city services were suspended and flights were cancelled, rescheduled, and cancelled again. I had to change my initial housing plans to avoid a communal living situation, and I started training with only a laptop\/tablet hybrid and no printer. Throughout training, Brendan, Leavitt and the Training Committee were very accommodating of my situation and the challenges we all faced from suddenly working remotely. I\u2019ve now completed my Orientation period, and I\u2019m in my own place where I have a desktop computer and two monitors. I\u2019m getting a hang of things here at CBAR.

This is me when I started my very first company. I was working from bedroom and any random place I was in the mood to go. Had nothing fancy to start with so began with whatever I had - a basic laptop and a BIG dream. \n\n2. This is the UN conference room. This is where I dreamt to speak. That time, it seemed like an impossible dream. I visualised myself standing on the stage and sharing my journey.\n\n3. In 2015, my wildest dream came true. Here I am, speaking in a UN conference room. I was the youngest youth representative of entrepreneurship (India).\n\n4. I went for a conference in Boston where I decided to run a 10 km marathon with Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian of all time. \n\nThat's when it hit me, it's all about creating a legacy now. After this day, I started speaking across the globe - shared my story, gave away the lessons I learnt and thus started leaving my legacy behind.\n\n5. Damn, this is a day I can never forget. My first paid international speech in Singapore & stay at my dream hotel - Marina Bay Sands (fully sponsored for me, my brother and a friend üòç) \n\nPLUS: Got my first international social media consultancy project.\n\n6. Got featured in a magazine for the very first time. Since then have been featured in several publications like IB Times, YourStory, Business World and more.\n\n7. In 2019, initiated my first office project. I worked out of home and my dad\u2019s old office from 2013 to 2018. A dream came true - 2 storied building with a personal glass cabin.

It can severely affect the heart, vessels, nerves, kidney, skin and brain. Studies have shown that SAR-CoV-2 can cause severe damage, even in patients with mild symptoms or those in recovery. Often this damage is detected very late or not at all. People recovering from symptoms noted trouble with concentration, confused thoughts, memory loss, loss of consciousness, seizures, loss of smell and taste, psychosis, anxiety, delirium, trouble focusing, etc. Researchers found that one-way COVID attacks the body is by causing inflammation and swelling of the brain. \n\nBecause of significant involvement of lungs (prolonged ventilators, tracheostomy and dyspnea), nerve damage, and nervous system dysfunction (encephalopathy, stroke, seizure, psychiatric changes, etc.) Cognitive, Speech, Language and Swallowing difficulties are observed in individuals positive with COVID-19. A Speech-Language Pathologist (SLP) can help with the mentioned problems.\n\n‚≠êCOMMUNICATION: When on ventilator\/tracheostomy and individual is unble to voice,SLP can provide with alternative methods of communication. Some individuals post stroke\/encephalopathy have slurred speech (Dysarthria) or language difficulty (Aphasia) which requires help with communication and expression.\n\n‚≠êSWALLOWING: Breathing tube, vocal cord damage, fluids in lungs, in-coordination or weakness of throat and oral muscles can cause significant swallowing difficulties and requires prompt intervention by an SLP.\n\n‚≠êCOGNITION: With cognitive functions (memory, problem solving, reasoning, attention etc) affected, an SLP can step in with strategies and early intervention.\n.\n.\n.\n#covid19 #covid19india #covid #coronavirus #pandemic #pandemic2020 #speechlanguagetherapy #speechtherapy #languagetherapy #swallowtherapy #dysphagiatherapy #slp #slpsofinstagram #speech #language #cognition #swallowing #aphasia #dysarthria #dysphagia #cognitiveimpairment #tracheostomy #ventilator #encephalopathy #memoryloss #lossoftasteandsmell #nervedamage #seizures #mumbai #fixmyspeech","NumberOfLikes":20,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by All About Speech Therapy in Mumbai, Maharashtra.

Schools going from a single special education teacher to dozens. Children\u2019s hospitals now in every city. Children are being diagnosed with illnesses such as autism, asthma, allergies, cancer and ADHD at an unbelievable rate. The etiology of autism continues to confound mainstream medicine (deathcare), yet parents, independent  researchers, and anyone with a few brains cells dedicated to unraveling the mystery are putting the pieces of the puzzle into place. Mainstream media and medicine are nothing more than prostitutes for the companies and organizations who profit from the sick children. Although the specific pathophysiology of each individual child's illness varies, they all have the same basic underlying causes. It is a perfect storm of poison including decades of pharmaceutical over-usage, toxic food or nutritionally deficient diets, excessive exposure to environmental toxins and without question excessive toxic exposure from vaccination.\n\nThe only way out of this madness is to opt out of their insane system. Take control of our children's health. Being educated and informed is the only survival mechanism because those in media and medicine are mostly liars who are paid to protect their ruling pharma overlords in order to earn there own self serving compensation. The deception is beyond our wildest imagination and the lies are stacked as far the eyes can see. Reject their toxic food, medications, deathcare and vaccines. Relying on the legal system or political system to enforce change and protect us is just another illusion tricking you into bullshitting yourself that someone else is going to save you, your family or our society.

In 2015, the quantity of HIV\/AIDS patients oscillated between \"34.0\u201339.8 million\", meanwhile the death rate reported was also very high, as 35 million died from HIV\/AIDS according to the World Health Organization (\u201C10 Facts on HIV\/AIDS\u201D, n.d.). HIV\/AIDS are deathly pathologies that require a more efficient response from public opinion and political agendas.\r\n\nThe HIV and its posterior stage AIDS both limit the response to infections and diseases by jeopardizing the performance of the CD4 cells, a condition that brings weakness sensation and other initial flu symptoms in the first weeks and might advance to other chronicle diseases, such as cancer in a posterior acute AIDS phase. Nonetheless, HIV\/AIDS are insidious diseases for patients and politics. \u201CHIV testing reach is still limited, as an estimated 40% of people with HIV or over 14 million people remain undiagnosed and don't know their infection status\" (\u201C10 Facts on HIV\/AIDS\u201D, n.d.). Therefore, not only HIV symptoms can be undervalued by the patients who might think that is a simple flu, but neither authorities have implemented the right programs for HIV\/AIDS diagnosis and treatment, especially in developing countries. \r\n\nThe most common modes of transmissions are three: when someone carries HIV and has anal or vaginal sex without proper protection (facilitating the share of fluids), lack of hygienic measures in blood-transfusion centers, and breast milk supply from an infected mother. That is why sex education is so important, just as maternity education and the implementation of higher quality standards throughout health centers. Moreover, among all the treatments available, antiretroviral therapy helps HIV\/AIDS patients to minimize the HIV levels in their bodies.\n\nHIV\/AIDS are diseases that require more attention from public institutions. Especially the ones in developing countries or under a humanitarian crisis.\n\n#aids #who #cepal #onu #essay #culture #politics #healthcare #sida #hiv #pandemic","NumberOfLikes":3,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Joseph Essay Writer on August 21, 2020.

At that time, I probably envisioned that from my studio apartment, I\u2019d move to a bigger place, & that that next move would involve my getting married & having kids.\n\nIn fact, one of my underlying fears during the years I lived in Brooklyn was that I\u2019d run out of money & have to move home\u2014that I\u2019d *fail* at independent life as a grown-up.\n\nMoving in w\/a parent one month shy of your 45th birthday is not typically seen as an ideal situation & embraced. Likely, it would even be met w\/derision or judgement from others, & more judgment & shame from myself. In normal times. But we are not in normal times.\n\nTake a cancer diagnosis & undergoing treatment, & mix it in with a global pandemic, & everything changes. ONE HUNDRED PERCENT of people I\u2019ve told about my decision to move home to the suburbs & in with my Mom\u2014from my psychiatrist, to friends, to everyone here on social media\u2014have responded that that\u2019s a great thing to do & the right choice, & some have even expressed jealousy!\n\nI loved a lot about living in Brooklyn while I was there, but now I happily release my isolated, independent life of financial & emotional struggle for a much more peaceful & less lonely existence here in my hometown. With the companionship of my Mom. With the familiarity of the streets I could navigate in my sleep. With the deep smell of nature. With the spontaneous run-ins w\/people I grew up with. With a bedroom I love that looks out on the porch & the trees\u2014and sometimes deer\u2014beyond it, & that\u2019s almost as big as my entire apartment was.\n\nI didn\u2019t have the space, or the money, for a couch when I lived on my own in Brooklyn. Here there\u2019s a couch I can cozy up on, & as you can see I love being cozy. ü•∞","NumberOfLikes":159,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Jennifer Garam in Cozy Time.

I really like all bamboo handicrafts because since childhood our parents already have bamboo weaving skills to make various types of baskets.\n\nI feel very lucky, because since February 2020, two of my fellow graduates and I were given the opportunity to join a special training for three full months by East Bali Bamboo Bikes (social enterprise), on how to process bamboo to make various types of products that can be sold with more expensive price. At the beginning of the training, we had orientation. East Bali Bamboo Bikes artisans explained all the special tools\/equipment that we\u2019d use to process bamboo, including special chisels and knives, sanding machines, saws, grinders, drills, etc. that I\u2019d never used before. In the training I learned to make various types of bamboo handicrafts, such as balancing dragonfly, laminated snake, several animals, marine biota and toy vehicles. Most importantly we\u2019ve learned how to build various bamboo bike frames and laminated bamboo mudguards.\n\nAt the end of March, we suddenly had to stop due to the COVID-19 pandemic!

Maybe your brother isn\u2019t blind but maybe something has happened to you or someone close to you and you think it shouldn\u2019t have happened or shouldn\u2019t be happening now. \n\nBut it is. So what do we do?\n\nByron Katie says that when we argue with reality we lose, but only üíØ percent of the time. \n\nSo how do we win?\n\nWe win by accepting that we cannot change circumstances that our outside of our control. \n\nWe can control ourselves. \n\nWe can manage our thinking about things- and that doesn\u2019t mean that we want to think positively of things that we hate. But we can do better than seeing situations as black or white. \n\nWe win by shifting our perception to provide us with a result that serves us. \n\nLearning of my brothers recent blindness felt like a blow at first. I noticed I wanted to be so angry and find a solution for him to make his life better (all my thoughts). \n\nWhile these intentions seem right, they filled me with more anger and anxiety because I was focusing on what I thought he should be doing. Whatever we focus on we create more of, so focusing on anxiety-generating activities will only produce MORE anxiety. \n\nThe truth is that I have no idea what he should be doing. But I know exactly the kind of sister I want to be while he is deciding how to manage his new life. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m not willing to offer him resources or ideas if he asks for them. \n\nBut it means that at the end of the day I show up without an agenda for him. I allow him to be who he is. \n\nThe work for me or for anyone struggling to control a situation is to practice being who I want to be in any circumstance. \n\nHow do you want to show up for whatever is happening in your life right now?\n\nYou get to choose, my friends. \n\n#life #perspective #goldengatebridge #pandemic #news #sanfrancisco #wildfires #sonomacounty #happyfriday #lifecoach #coaching @byron.katie #perception #reality #lawofattraction","NumberOfLikes":11,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Wendy on August 21, 2020.

It\u2019s been an integral part of our business strategy since the #pandemic began. As such we\u2019ve pulled together our Top 10 Tips for Hosting Webinars to share with you. \n\n1.\tTime \u2013 getting the timing right can make or break attendance at a webinar. Are you clashing with other events? What time zone are you and potential attendees in? Lunchtime can be great for people if they like a working lunch.\n2.\tDay \u2013 we all know that Mondays and Fridays can be busy catching up on the last week or preparing for the next, so look to hold webinars mid-week. From experience we found Thursday is a good day.\n3.\tLength \u2013 this will very much depend on the subject and the interaction you want with attendees. Overly long webinars could mean that attendees skip out and miss important points. Where possible limit to an hour, especially if being held over lunchtimes. \n4.\tRecordings \u2013Making a recording available will be appreciated by participants who skipped out or could not attend last minute. It also enables attendees to share with their connections.\n5.\tTopic \u2013 be focused rather than general and provide real world examples.\n6.\tEngagement \u2013 Ask questions to engage audience and use polls and chat for responses.\n7.\tPresentation \u2013 Use images to convey a message rather than text and ensure continuity throughout, especially if co-presenting with others where a joint presentation has been created.\n8.\tMarketing - promote early, encourage people to share, provide an easy mechanism for sign-up.\n9.\tTechnology \u2013 with many of us working from home currently do you have sufficient Wi-Fi to avoid dips in connection? Are you familiar with the software, a trial run before hand will add confidence in delivery.\n10.\tHave a buddy \u2013 someone who can monitor the chat and polls and provide immediate feedback to support the presenter. \n\nWould you add to the Tips?

I can\u2019t even imagine not living here anymore, it\u2019s the only place I\u2019ve ever considered home.\n\nI\u2019m starting to get statements from my health insurance company for my recent hospitalization and the total is over $61,000 dollars. American healthcare isn\u2019t for anyone but the insanely rich. I can feel myself giving up which I hate. I just fall so easily into depression these days that David has to remind me to even eat.\n\nI\u2019m still trying my hardest to put helpful insight into the world, but only had energy for Reddit and gaming the last few days. I gamed with a lady friend of mine that I haven\u2019t in a while last night and it was the first time all week I felt happy.\n\nI just feel destroyed. No job and a career I have no interest in actually going back to, medical bills I\u2019ll never be able to play, rent which I won\u2019t be able to afford in a year, rapidly declining mental heath that\u2019s starting to scare me, terrible nightmares with little sleep and no solutions.\n\nI know life isn\u2019t suppose to be easy, but so often these days I feel too fragile to keep fighting. My mind is going places I\u2019m too terrified to even acknowledge.\n\nI didn\u2019t draw for a few days and hated myself for it, but I managed this piece last night. My hand felt forced, but I don\u2019t dislike the outcome which is a nice feeling to sit with for a little while.\n\nMagic Conflux 17\n6\u201D x 6\u201D \u2022 Procreate\n\n#magick #conflux #art #drawing #procreate #digitalart #illustration #monoline #bw #blackandwhite #abstract #graphicart #inspired #mandala #beautifulbizarre #nycartist #nyc #mindfulness #hopelessness #fear #truth #fragility #stress #living #pandemic","NumberOfLikes":19,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Diane on August 21, 2020.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598017038,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 15:37:18 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Follow me @mdotblake \n#tapenology #mask #fashion #safty #style #protection #fashionblogger \n#fashiondesign #getyours #paintings #brandambassador #quantumkente #takingorders #limitededition #pandemic #covid19 #mdotblake #mblakeinc \n\nInbox me if you would like a mask. \nOr place your order at\nMdotblake.com","NumberOfLikes":61,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1598017034,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 15:37:14 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Die Zahl der Corona-Neuinfektionen ist in den vergangenen Wochen wieder deutlich gestiegen.

David got laid off. His company was devastated to have to do it but if Hollywood isn\u2019t making enough movies then enough movie trailers aren\u2019t being made either. They did everything to wait it out and for that we are grateful. They are one of the most loving and caring companies he has had the privilege of being with and as soon as things can kick back in they\u2019ll be asking him back again! \n\nWithin a two week window our life did a 180*. We made some insanely fast choices, packed up our 3 bed 2 bath rental in LA (which we LOVED, cried w\/our neighbors and landlord - who we also LOVED and will never stop being friends with), grabbed two storage units and an RV and parked ourselves on my grandparents property in VC.  So now we have an adventure in front of us. A blank slate if you will. We will use this time to create this property being restored and beautiful. It will honor my grandparents and my mother. \n\nWe will renovate the RV and that will be an amazing project with our 10-year-old daughter. We will invite friends to visit. We will document our life and our adventure on this Instagram account. The good the bad the ugly which is a very vulnerable and Big deal. Sometimes it\u2019s going to look amazing and magical and sometimes it\u2019s going to look disgusting and vile and ugly. And that\u2019ll include black widows and cobwebs. In the last three weeks so much has happened I\u2019m proud of how much we have accomplished and I\u2019m in disbelief at how fast we\u2019ve moved given the circumstances. We are not victims of the circumstances it\u2019s just kind of amazing and I am in awe. \n\nOur hearts have been blown open by the kindness of neighbors that we\u2019ve had a new neighbors that we had never met before and the amount of generous help we have gotten. And we will share that and document it as well.

We are doing our best here. 163 days ago when our kids had to leave their classrooms I saw a lot of spirited posts from teachers talking about how parents will now see what they go through every day. I, like most parents, have a deep appreciation for teachers. To say they play an important role in the lives of children is an understatement. Teachers study and train specifically to plan and execute a curriculum. Many parents, like myself, don\u2019t have that experience...and that\u2019s only 1 difference between what teachers experience in a classroom vs at home education during a pandemic. I juggle my full-time career and household while simultaneously trying to keep my son on-track academically and socially. Let\u2019s not forget that my son is 4 so he cannot prepare his own meals or effectively participate in e-learning. Nobody could have planned for this, but take a moment to think about all of the women (and men) doing no less than 5 full-time jobs simultaneously 24\/7 for 23 weeks and counting.

When we got off we would enjoy a pastry or quick bite at a new bakery or cafe we discovered before making it to campus. When we arrived, we were impressed by the gorgeous campus. They even had an on campus greenhouse where they grew various vegetables and offered classes in the garden. There was also an on campus vineyard for olives and grape cultivation.

It dwarfs the Great Recession. So it\u2019s not surprising that we would also see the worst increase in the uninsured.\u201D\n.\nFamilies USA is one of a number of groups trying to estimate the number of people who have lost insurance during the pandemic; definitive data will not become available until mid- to late 2021, when the federal government publishes health insurance estimates for 2020. The analyses vary, but all reach the same grim conclusion: More people lack insurance than ever before.\n.\nThe nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation has¬†estimated¬†that 27 million Americans have lost coverage in the pandemic; that study took into account family members of the insured.¬†Another analysis,¬†published Monday by the Urban Institute and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, projected that by the end of 2020, 10.1 million people will no longer have employer-sponsored health insurance or coverage that was tied to a job they lost because of the pandemic.\n.\nAuthor \/ Shery Gay Stolberg \/ https:\/\/www-nytimes-com.cdn.ampproject.org\nPhoto: \/ Erin Schaff\/The New York Times","NumberOfLikes":1,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Den√©W on August 21, 2020.

For retail sales associates, for example, skills such as sales operations, account management and negotiation can be highly transferable. When retail sales associates migrate into new jobs such as inside sales or business development, such existing skills deliver about 70% to 80% of relevant expertise. This high overlap helps job-switchers succeed in their transitions -- and be effective without needing a lot of explicit retraining or fresh credentials.\u201D Check out the two charts to see how you can make a career pivot! \n.\nFollow @shortgazeproductions for more tips on how to re-invent yourself during this pandemic.","NumberOfLikes":6,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598014419,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 14:53:39 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Since 2001, HealthLink Dental Clinic (@healthlinkdental) has offered free dental services to low-wage-earning adults and military veterans age 18 and older in Bucks and Montgomery Counties who are without dental insurance. üíô\n\nPhoto: HealthLink volunteers Neil Dispirito, DDS and Delfina Costa outfitted in PPE gear in between patient appointments at the free dental clinic.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.timespub.com\/2020\/08\/02\/healthlink-dental-clinic-reopens-in-wake-of-pandemic-2\/\n\n#TPNP #goodnews #simplyrealnews #fittoprint #healthlinkdental #dentalclinic #free #reopen #pandemic","NumberOfLikes":6,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Times Publishing Newspapers in HealthLink Dental Clinic with @healthlinkdental.

We have been able to provide members of our community with a wonderful sense of connection, even amidst a health crisis.

The current track brings this system into the eastern #Gulf as a #hurricane early next week. There remains too much uncertainty at this point to pin down potential local impacts, outside of an increasing #ripcurrent risk.\n\nTropical Depression #14 is currently moving northwest near the coast of #Honduras and is expected to enter the southern #GulfofMexico later this weekend. Again, it's too early to determine impacts here locally (if any) at this point.\n\nWhat We Know: Rip current risk will increase to a HIGH RISK by Sunday and will likely extend through early next week.\n\nWhat We DO NOT Know: There is a LOT of uncertainty in the track and intensity of these systems. It's tough to pinpoint specifics at this point. #Rain chances and #winds will be driven significantly by the track of these systems.\n\nWhat Should YOU Do: Update your #hurricanepreparedness kit this week.

Due to this, there has been a rise in consumption of Ayurvedic remedies and herbal immunity boosters.¬†I am going back to the roots and sharing my recipe of making a simple Golden Kadha which is great for one's immunity. \nIn this recipe, you need to use\n\u2022 Giloy\n\u2022 Tulsi\n\u2022 Ashwagandha \n\u2022 Raw turmeric\n‚óáGiloy is a universal herb that helps boost immunity. It is a powerhouse of¬†antioxidants¬†which keeps your cells healthy and helps in getting rid of a number of diseases. It helps in removing toxins, purifies blood, fights bacteria that causes diseases and also combats liver diseases.¬†\n\n‚óáTulsi, as we all know, does wonders. It acts as a natural immune system booster and keep infections away. It protects against nearly all infections from viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa.\n\n‚óá Ashwagandha, with its unique fragrance, helps to increase strength, muscle mass and improve brain function as well.\n\n‚óáRaw Turmeric, helps in boosting up the immunity and helps to fight against viral replication due to its anti-inflammatory, antiseptic and anti-bacterial properties.\n\nFor full recipe, visit\nwww.thenutricion.com\n\n#nutricionbymanika #trending #health #healthybody #pandemic #nutrition #healthylifestyle #yoga #indian #viral #picoftheday #tipoftheday #tyasquad #happy #covid #coronavirus #staysafe #stayhome #behappy #recipe #recipeoftheday #homemade #fit #fitness #fitnessmotivation","NumberOfLikes":28,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1595062898,"LocalDate":"Sat Jul 18 11:01:38 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"- Sakarya University Faculty of Law not only awarded a law degree to visually impaired student Berru Merve Kul after 4 years of completing her law education, they also conferred an honorary degree to her mother who helped Berru by reading all the texts out loud at home.üèÖüí´\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#Style #Fashion #Lifestyle #lifestyleblogger #styleblogger #fashionblogger #pakdrama #covid19 #pandemic #Pakistanicelebrities #pakistanifashion #Instagood #instamood #instadaily #instanation #Pakistan #Lahore #karachi #Islamabad #multeemedia30 #fullermag","NumberOfLikes":81,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Multee Media 3.0 on August 21, 2020.

Akan tatapi sering kali ketika anda membelinya di pasar sering terjadi kontak fisik secara langsung hingga mengabaikan jaga jarak aman yang secara tidak langsung dapat beresiko terpapar virus tersebut. Selain itu juga, pandemi ini mengakibatkan banyak hilangnya pekerjaan sebagian masyarakat hingga mengakibatkan kesulitan ekonomi. \n\nPada kesempatan kali ini, saya ingin mengajak masyarakat untuk 'tetap produktif saat pandemi covid-19, dengan membuat tosaga (toko obat dan sayuran keluarga)'. Menanam sendiri di pekarangan seperti tanaman herbal dan sayuran untuk nanti hasilnya dapat dimanfaatkan untuk di konsumsi sendiri oleh masyarakat, dan sisanya bisa dijual untuk pemasukan masyarakat tersebut. Selain itu bisa membuat antibody lebih hemat, tidak perlu membeli vitamin yang harganya bisa ratusan ribu. Kegiatan ini juga bisa dijadikan kegiatan berolahraga dan menjaga kerukunan hidup bermasyarakat hingga menjadi suntikan semangat dimusim pandemi seperti ini. \n\nDPL : Anton Aulawi, SH., MH\n@kkmunbaja02_2020\n\n#covid19 #pandemic #covid #dirumahsaja #serang #banten #lawancovid19 #likeforlikes #kampus #kkm #kkmunbaja2020 #kkmkelompok02 #hitzunbaja #unbaja #unbajaserang #unbajaeksis #lppmunbaja #unbajaberkarakter #kkm","NumberOfLikes":198,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1064,"Timestamp":1596865581,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 08 07:46:21 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Only when normal things are not normal anymore\nDo we realise how special normal things are!\n\n#pandemic #effects #outside #green #morning #fresh #lively #selfie #me #thinkingpositive #quarantinelife #waiting #missingtravel #lockdown2020 #lockdown","NumberOfLikes":42,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by rushda chougle in Midc Mahape.

Create a self-imposed time limit for being on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other online networks. Take a break from the flood of information on COVID-19 and the economy and from the stress this can create. \u2063\n\u2063\n2. Read a self-development book and\/or listen to a podcast. \u2063\n\u2063\n3. Update your resume. When did you last add recent skills you developed, training and conferences you attended, and certifications you earned? Even if you are not job searching now, it\u2019s always good to keep your resume current, especially in an uncertain economy. \u2063\n\u2063\n4. Evaluate your skills, Know your weaknesses then book a coach or ake an online class. Many websites offer free courses. Find something that interests you and sign up. \u2063\n\u2063\n5. Master that hobby that you love. Whether it\u2019s photography, writing, drawing, web-building or another passion, you now have the time to perfect it. This may even turn into an opportunity to earn extra money.\u2063\n\u2063\nWhich one sounds interesting to you and which one will you take a chance to start? ‚¨áÔ∏è ‚¨áÔ∏è ‚¨áÔ∏è\u2063\n\u2063\nShare your new tips and best practices while on lock-down as well!","NumberOfLikes":9,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Nik on August 21, 2020 tagging @nithilankarunakaran.

Menggunjing sangat menyenangkan bagi orang-orang yang hidupnya kebanyakan waktu luang untuk berkumpul dg sesamanya.\n.\nJiwa menggunjing semakin bergejolak ketika semakin banyak diperoleh info mencengangkan \n.\nDalam film Tilik yang merefleksi masyarakat saat ini digambarkan gunjingan dilakukan di sebuah truk oleh sekelompok ibu2.  Kenapa harus buibu, bahkan digambarkan yakni ibu2 rumah tangga ? karena realitasnya demikian walopun banyak juga laki2 bergunjing. Perempuan dg ideologi masyarakat patriarkal umumnya dikonstruksikan diri mereka untuk hanya terbatas  pada hal2 domestik, yg mengakibatkan terbatasnya ruang gerak berinteraksi, berkembang dan berwawasan. Hal ini juga berkaitan dengan terbatasnya orang-orang yang mereka temui.  Pengetahuan yang dikonsumsi tentu akan berbeda dg mereka yang setiap hari harus melakukan perencanaan, mmbuat strategi, merancang sebuah sistematika, di samping ia melakukan pekerjaan domestik bekerja sama dengan pasangannya. \n.\nini bukan soal perempuan bekerja atau tidak bekerja saja. tetapi kecenderungan setiap orang dapat menentukan dirinya untuk menjadi produktif atau tidak produktif. \n.\n\u201CJika dirimu tidak disibukkan dengan hal-hal yang baik, pasti akan disibukkan dengan hal-hal yang batil\u201D\nDan sangat mungkin saat luang seseorang melakukan hal yang batil.
