The don\u2019t just drive buses. At their discretion, they give homeless people somewhere warm to sleep. They provide security for night shift workers against people who have had too much to drink and are acting aggressively. I have seen bus drivers stop buses and get out of their seat to help older people on and off the bus, to intervene when women are sexually harassed, to sit down with their phone and help people who are lost get home when the other passengers don\u2019t care enough to help. .\n\nIn April 2020, TFL\u2019s director of bus operations, Claire Mann stated her devastation at the deaths of TFL employees But then she said the \u201Cvery latest scientific advice\u201D was that PPE was \u201Cnot required in non-care settings and could be counter-productive.\u201D In my opinion I lay the blame of TFL employees squarely at their employers feet. .\n\nDuring June 2020, when pandemic lockdown restrictions were easing I started looking for a new job and taking buses again with the knowledge of at least 23 London Bus drivers had died due to contracting Covid-19. I was pleased to see that bus drivers had finally been given protection. .\n\nAlso by this time it was made compulsory for passengers to wear face masks on public transport and I witnessed a new set of challenges for bus drivers. They are now left solely responsible for enforcing masks on the buses and also refusing passengers when the bus is full. Whilst doing this, I\u2019ve witnessed horrific verbal abuse from people who are challenged by the drivers on not wearing masks. This abuse has extended to racist slurs and ever banging on the barrier and kicking the drivers door. I have been disgusted by the reaction of the general public towards the men and women who are providing a key service. .\n\nIs standing outside and clapping once a week your maximum capacity to care? .\n\nThis series is dedicated to Mervyn Mally Kennedy. .\n\n#transportforlondon #tfl #covid19 #pandemic #lockdown #lockdownlondon #pandemic2020 #mervynmallykennedy #londonbusdrivers  #lockdownlife #f","NumberOfLikes":14,"Hashtags":["#Repost","#transportforlondon","#tfl","#covid19","#pandemic","#lockdown","#lockdownlondon","#pandemic2020","#mervynmallykennedy","#londonbusdrivers","#lockdownlife","#f"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by FIXPHOTO on August 25, 2020.

For me it is having the time to enjoy the simple things in life, from watching nature change into its finest clothing has been a real joy, it has allowed a sense of connection with nature and wildlife on a deeper level. The time to share a chat with neighbours that we hardly ever spoke to before and the real camaraderie of sharing and helping one another is one that I hope will last into the future, it has been so comforting to know that others too have the time to converse and are willing to do so, rather than racing off to face another working day. These are all pretty simple things but have made a huge difference in peoples lives, especially those that live alone and long may it continue. I have added some of my drawings that I have been working on during this time, which is my way of using all the extra time to be creative which in turn helps to diffuse the impact of the pandemic. #contemporaryart #oilpastel #oilpastels #oilpastelonpaper #landscapedrawing #drawing #drawings #covid19 #covid_19 #covid  #lockdown #lockdown2020 #lockdownlife #lockdowndiaries #pandemic #pandemic2020 #wellbeing #wellbeingjourney #mindfulness #mindful","NumberOfLikes":64,"Hashtags":["#contemporaryart","#oilpastel","#oilpastels","#oilpastelonpaper","#landscapedrawing","#drawing","#drawings","#covid19","#covid_19","#covid","#lockdown","#lockdown2020","#lockdownlife","#lockdowndiaries","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#wellbeing","#wellbeingjourney","#mindfulness","#mindful"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Elaine Fox on August 25, 2020.

In the upcoming weeks, several teachers will be sharing their passion and purpose for teaching piano specifically during the pandemic. I hope this series will provide support, encouragement, and inspiration as we all\u2014from around the world\u2014navigate the unique challenges of teaching music this semester.\n\n\u2022\n\nOur first featured teacher is @pianobycarollynn!\nCarolLynn teaches piano in Utah, USA and will be teaching both in person and online this semester.\n\nQ: What is your greatest passion and purpose for teaching piano during a pandemic? \n\n¬ª It was so important to me to keep the music going during the pandemic. We were right in the middle of preparing for our spring recital when everything shut down, which was heartbreaking. I really wanted my students to keep the momentum going even through the stressful times. I knew that music could be such a great outlet and reliever of stress, as I have experienced often throughout my life. I have been so proud of my students for pressing on and keeping the music going in their lives.\n\nQ: What is your favourite story from teaching during the pandemic?\n\n¬ª My favorite story from the pandemic was a text I got from the mom of one of my students. It was a picture of her daughter sitting at the piano in her Sunday dress. Because everything was shut down and they couldn\u2019t attend church, this student would play the hymns every Sunday for her family\u2019s \u201Chome church.\u201D I might have cried a little! ‚ô•Ô∏è\n\nQ: What is your best online teaching tip?\n\n¬ª What helped me most was having copies of the music my students were working on. That made it so much easier.\n\nQ: What do you wish someone had told you when you started teaching online?\n\n¬ª Looking back, I wish someone had told me to relax, to not worry about having all the fancy equipment, and to know that it would be ok and even GREAT!\n\n\u2022\n\nJoin the conversation! What did you resonate most with CarolLynn\u2019s pandemic teaching experience?

Today\u2019s stop on my pandemic Hollywood tour is the house that the Lopez family supposedly lived in on the show!\n\n\u201CThe George Lopez Show\u201D house was originally built in 1885, making it the second-oldest home in San Fernando. The idyllic, Victorian, 4-bedroom, single family residence was commissioned by Senator Charles Maclay, a founder of San Fernando, and his wife, Catherine Paxton Maclay.\n\nThe Lopez family home from show is located at \u202A671 Fourth Street in San Fernando\u202C. Thankfully, the property looks much the same in person as it did onscreen, though it has since been painted green. Please note that this is a private residence so if you visit please do not trespass or disturb the people that live there.\n\n\u201CThe George Lopez Show\u201D originally aired for six seasons on ABC from 2002 to 2007. It is currently in syndication on Nick at Nite, and stars the titular comedian George Lopez, who plays a fictionalized version of himself and revolves around his life at work and raising his family at home.\n\nLopez drew much of the material for the show from his own life experiences, especially his upbringing in the San Fernando Valley. Lopez was one of the few Latinos to star in a television comedy series, following in the footsteps of Desi Arnaz, Freddie Prinze, and John Leguizamo.\n\nFun facts - The sitcom would have never existed without Oscar winning actress Sandra Bullock. In 2000, Bullock saw Lopez perform live at the Brea Improv Comedy Club. Bullock had been interested in developing a TV show with a Latino storyline, being concerned about the lack of visibility for Latinos on American television. Bullock approached Lopez backstage after the show and made her pitch to produce and star in a situational comedy centered around the comedian. \n\nFor the first five seasons, the show had an all-Latino cast with the exception of Albanian American actress Masiela Lusha, who played George\u2019s daughter Carmen.\n\nThe character \u201CGeorge Lopez\" was ranked #18 in \"TV Guide\"'s list of the \"50 Greatest TV Dads of All Time\"#filminglocation #thegeorgelopezshow #sanfernando #hollywoodtour #pandemic2020 #socialdistancing #wearamask #tonymiros","NumberOfLikes":24,"Hashtags":["#18","#filminglocation","#thegeorgelopezshow","#sanfernando","#hollywoodtour","#pandemic2020","#socialdistancing","#wearamask","#tonymiros"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1598374016,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 18:46:56 CEST 2020","Location":"San Fernando Valley"},{"Owner":"travsolo","CaptionText":"Narrow streets has ways of bringing you closer to beautiful realities üá≤üá¶ \n\u2060\nCool #solotravel üì∏ by @boifromvenus\n\u2060\nFollow & Tag @travsolo on your awesome travel pics for a chance to be featured! ‚úàÔ∏è\u2060\n.\u2060\n.\u2060\n.\u2060\n.\u2060\n.\u2060\n.\u2060\n.\u2060\n#solofemaletraveller #socialdistancingworks #extrovertedintrovert\u2063 #solotraveler #solotravelingisfun #solotraveling #girlstravel #globaltravel #covidtravel #pandemic2020 #pandemictravel #covidtravel2020 #morrocco","NumberOfLikes":21,"Hashtags":["#solotravel","#solofemaletraveller","#socialdistancingworks","#extrovertedintrovert\u2063","#solotraveler","#solotravelingisfun","#solotraveling","#girlstravel","#globaltravel","#covidtravel","#pandemic2020","#pandemictravel","#covidtravel2020","#morrocco"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Solo Travel Easier on August 25, 2020.

Trump has inherited the Death Star of mind manipulation. The digital dictatorship that we have been living under which knows our behaviors better than our own families...and even ourselves.

That's how you can remember us, we're like a ginger cookie. Everybody loves 'em, right?!\"\n\nThere are two kind of people in Inwood. Those who know and love Cookie and Ginger, and those who haven't met them yet. These two doyennes of the domain share decades of local history. They've seen this neighborhood through good & bad, boom & bust, high times and low. And always, always, they greet passersby with smiles and charm so winning that the busiest of us will take a few moments out of our day to stop and talk.\n\nWhich made seeing them the perfect capper to our trip back home. Like everyone, their style has been cramped by the pandemic. Being fans of live music and the nightlife in Norhtern Manhattan and the Bronx, they're often beckoned by bar owners and karaoke DJs to come spend a few hours at their establishment.  They'll send cars to come pick them up. They'll reserve bar stools. They'll buy them drinks. It's good business, but it's also just plain tradition. They don't pay for drinks, and they don't sing karaoke - but they'll loudly cheer everyone who does and they'll stay until late in the night.\n\nThe virus, of course, put the kibosh on all that. So for the time being, these two don their masks and park their chairs at the top of the 215th street stairs every evening, wishing travelers a safe journey out or welcoming them home for the night. Bartenders sometimes send a runner up the stairs with a couple refreshments. Those of us walking dogs stop and chew the fat. There are psychic scars left on this community from the casualties of early Spring. No one denies that. But Life. Goes. On. Because New York - and New Yorkers - endure.\n\n(Irony of ironies: Cookie showed me the pocket calendar she bought, the first she's ever owned, right at the start of 2020.

It\u2019s the last few weeks. It\u2019s a bitter sweet time of year for me, especially this one. It\u2019s been 90 plus pretty much all summer, during a pandemic. A FLIPPING PANDEMIC. Beyond hot and humid, trying to balance social distancing with an active 3 year old. Explaining we can see our family only, wearing masks everywhere, trying to make sure a little person who doesn\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening mental health is being tended to. Isolating him, keeping him and others safe, and all the while being judged for doing it. That\u2019s the culture we live in these days. Everyone thinks the know best not only for themselves but everyone else. Keyboard warriors. The cool thing is a long time ago I learned that what others think and say and feel about me isn\u2019t for me at all, it\u2019s for them. And that\u2019s a freedom I try tonnevee give away. There\u2019s so much much to what others are going through. Things aren\u2019t ever black and white. My job isn\u2019t to judge others but to stay in my lane and help my neighbor anyway i can. \nMy most favorite time of year coming to its end, but my runner up of fall is just on the horizon. I\u2019m starting to see pops of yellow, red, oranges in the trees. As the seasons change I\u2019m navigating covid 19 and life in general. Now I\u2019m gearing up for a new role of teacher. Juggling mom role, partner, business woman. Whoa. All while planning a wedding. Seasons are changing, and so am I.

Once you identify it, share it with the world. \n\nWant help trying to identify your gifts, strengths and superpowers, contact me today (sweethoneybeelife.com)!\n\nDon't forget to like this post and follow @sweethoneybee_life !\n\n‚ú®\n‚ú®\n‚ú®\n‚ú®\n‚ú®\n‚ú®\n‚ú®\n\n#shareyourgift #themeaningoflifeistofindyourgiftthepurposeoflifeistogiveitaway #pablopicasso #youareenough #findyourgifts #strengths #talents #youhavethepower #liftsomeoneup #reframeyourthoughts #makeapositiveimpact #shiftenergy #strengthsfinder #shineyourlight #whatsyoursuperpower #knowledgeispower #positivity #resilience #coaching #change #transitioncoach #columbusohio #pandemic2020 #sweethoneybeelife #keepshiningüåü","NumberOfLikes":2,"Hashtags":["#shareyourgift","#themeaningoflifeistofindyourgiftthepurposeoflifeistogiveitaway","#pablopicasso","#youareenough","#findyourgifts","#strengths","#talents","#youhavethepower","#liftsomeoneup","#reframeyourthoughts","#makeapositiveimpact","#shiftenergy","#strengthsfinder","#shineyourlight","#whatsyoursuperpower","#knowledgeispower","#positivity","#resilience","#coaching","#change","#transitioncoach","#columbusohio","#pandemic2020","#sweethoneybeelife","#keepshiningüåü"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Sweet Honeybee Life in Columbus, Ohio with @melissa.opasic, and @sweethoneybee_life.

Officially a Certified Life Coach through @jrnicoaching üçæüéä\n\nI made my own grad cap! I opened a fancy bottle of Champagne I was gifted by a friend over a year ago from France (I was saving it for a special occasion)!! AND I gave my OWN dang self a certificate of excellence just for taking this leap (and because it freaking made me feel good)! Because you are allowed to pat yourself on the back. Lift yourself up. Celebrate you! I chose to CELEBRATE this huge accomplishment with every ounce of joy in me! To make a big deal out of it!\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine that only 6 months ago I was hovering over the \u201Cconfirm payment\u201D button. Fully accepting this dream. This path I wanted to be on. This person I wanted to become. Putting my money where my mouth was. Could I actually do this?\n\nSpoiler alert: UH. YA. YA I COULD. AND HELL TO THE YA I DID.\n\nI worked hard. I found a way to pay for it. I showed up every Sunday for 6 months. I worked on myself. I helped others work on themselves. I learned more about who I am. I found my deep purpose on this Earth. There are no words for the utter joy and knowing I have about the next steps in this journey. Cannot wait to continue to share with all my important people üçæüéä\n\nAlso just a huge thank you to life itself for always booting me in the ass when I need it. For giving me the people and the lessons to become more of who I am, and ditch more of who I am not. For always placing exactly what I need, when I need it, within my grasp.

Before the pandemic hit, I felt as though I had a good rhythm of going to work and finding a fitness class to take with friends before coming home to cook dinner. \n\nWhen we entered quarantine and started working from home on the regular, my routine turned into crap. I was getting up 5 minutes before I had to start working. I no longer had a stand up desk since I was not at the office so I was sitting all day. I did not feel like moving my body after work especially since I was not meeting friends to do workouts and I was cooking whatever was easy, which usually meant not good nutrients for my body. All around I felt really shitty about myself. \n\nI knew I needed something to help me kickstart and get back into a routine that I could be consistent and comfortable with on a daily basis. Thank goodness I found an online accountability group of badass people that keep me feeling confident and hold me accountable to the routine I was looking to establish. \n\nSince joining this accountability group, I workout at home everyday and eat nutritious meals that help fuel my body. I am have more energy and all around I am a happier person. I even sleep better! \n\nBecause I have found so much success with establishing a better routine, I have decided to pay it forward, so I am looking to help people that could use more consistency in their routine to make healthier choices to feel better about themselves in this crazy time. If you are interested in joining my accountability group, leave me a comment below or DM me for details. \n\nToday is a great first step to a better YOU! \n\n#quarantine #workingfromhome #routine ##confidence #quarantinelife #pandemic #pandemic2020 #accountability #healthyhabits #healthyhabitsforlife #homelife #healthymealideas #sleepbetter #newnormal2020 #newnorm #newnormal","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#quarantine","#workingfromhome","#routine","#confidence","#quarantinelife","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#accountability","#healthyhabits","#healthyhabitsforlife","#homelife","#healthymealideas","#sleepbetter","#newnormal2020","#newnorm","#newnormal"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @ms.sara.stevens in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Por causa da pandemia do covid-19, a feira, que deveria ter sido aberta em abril, foi cancelada, provocando uma discuss√£o entre associa√ß√µes que representam as galerias e a dire√ß√£o da SP-Arte pela devolu√ß√£o do dinheiro pago pelo aluguel dos espa√ßos no pavilh√£o da Bienal. \n\nSegundo Fernanda Feitosa, a SP-Arte devolveu a integralidade dos pagamentos efetuados e diversas galerias, muitas delas expositoras desde a primeira edi√ß√£o e outras recentes, optaram por deixar o cr√©dito para a edi√ß√£o de 2021.\n\nSe h√° menos galerias na edi√ß√£o virtual, que vai at√© o dia 30, a perda de alguns participantes foi compensada pela entrada de novos parceiros \u2013 ali√°s nov√≠ssimos, caso da HOA, galeria de arte paulistana fundada este ano pela artista Igi Lola Ayedun, dedicada √† arte contempor√¢nea latino-americana, que j√° usa a internet como ponto operacional. Igualmente criada por artistas e tendo como curadores brasileiros e africanos, a 01.01 Platform promove artistas emergentes com o apoio de institui√ß√µes do Reino Unido, Portugal e Gana. \n\nTentando uma nova abordagem do mercado, ela prop√µe uma forma alternativa de colecionismo, que leve em conta a cultura produzida nos pa√≠ses da antiga rota comercial da escravid√£o.\n\nLink na bio.\n\nFonte: Estad√£o\n\n#covid19 #coronavirus #ONN #onovonormal #ONNpoliticapublica #covidart #covid2020, #covid19brasil #covidmask #covidphotodiaries #covidnews #covid19art #corona #coronav√≠rus #coronavirusbrazil #coronaviruspandemic #coronavirusoutbreak #coronavirus2020 #pandemic #pandemicart #pandemic2020, #pandemicorona #pandemiclife #fiqueemcasa #futuro #reuniaoonline #homeoffice #trabalhandoemcasa #emcasa","NumberOfLikes":10,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#coronavirus","#ONN","#onovonormal","#ONNpoliticapublica","#covidart","#covid2020,","#covid19brasil","#covidmask","#covidphotodiaries","#covidnews","#covid19art","#corona","#coronav√≠rus","#coronavirusbrazil","#coronaviruspandemic","#coronavirusoutbreak","#coronavirus2020","#pandemic","#pandemicart","#pandemic2020,","#pandemicorona","#pandemiclife","#fiqueemcasa","#futuro","#reuniaoonline","#homeoffice","#trabalhandoemcasa","#emcasa"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by O Novo Normal in S√£o Paulo, Brazil.

I've been driven to bombard all my senses. The food I cook has been more flavorful than usual and I've been listening to classical music every day, something I haven't done for years. After going nearly 35 years without using perfume, some days I rub a bit on my wrists. Surrounding myself with color has been a priority. For most of the summer I've created flower arragements with flowers from my garden. I've been drawn to intense colors and search for beauty when I am taking pictures.

Many religious ceremonies involve singing, such as Sunday Mass at Church. A study found that singing caused 53 of the 61 choir members testing positive and 102 of 130 members of an Amsterdam choir developed COVID-19 after a performance, and four people associated with the choir died. In Austria, 43 of 44 participants in a choir seminar tested positive.¬†\n\nRegardless of the distance between the musicians, harmony comes with dedicated, supervised practice. In an uncontrolled setting with distractions, dedicated practice is impossible. However, musicians also gain something by practicing at home. In a comfortable, relaxed environment they may be able to play better. Whether good or bad, stay-at-home musicians will give their audience a unique performance as they perform in the comfort, or discomfort, of their own home.¬†\n\nhttps:\/\/thelcr.com\/can-music-programs-survive-covid-19\/ (article in bio) \n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n#thelcr #musicclass #virtuallearning #educationmatters #musiceducation #socialjustice #harmony #votingmatters #choirlife #choirs #choirmusic #justiceforbreonnataylor #musicals #musicianslife #education #musiciansdaily #singingüé§ #wesing #highschool #highschoolmusical #discrimination #choirdirector #beautifulvoice #beautifulvoices #pandemic2020 #teachersrock #musicteacher #musicmatters #jazzmusician #classicalmusician","NumberOfLikes":12,"Hashtags":["#thelcr","#musicclass","#virtuallearning","#educationmatters","#musiceducation","#socialjustice","#harmony","#votingmatters","#choirlife","#choirs","#choirmusic","#justiceforbreonnataylor","#musicals","#musicianslife","#education","#musiciansdaily","#singingüé§","#wesing","#highschool","#highschoolmusical","#discrimination","#choirdirector","#beautifulvoice","#beautifulvoices","#pandemic2020","#teachersrock","#musicteacher","#musicmatters","#jazzmusician","#classicalmusician"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The LCR in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

But yesterday while listening to an awesome discussion between @therealbrianrose and @awakenwithjp called \u2018Fighting Censorship\u2019 I was struck by the passion and sincerity these two men had for defending free speech. I realised if I agreed with everything they were saying I need to start talking about this issue with my wider circles as well. The facts are, free speech is under threat right beneath our noses. I used to think the firewalls in China were scary until I came to understand that same concept is alive and well in every country around the world through manipulated search engine rankings, a biased media machine, and increasingly blatant censorship on social media.

I have a plethora of masks and face shields. I ordered in a small case of hand sanitizes or what we call at school \"hanitizer\u201D now if I could only get a good left foot (broke mine in a Red Lily Beetle battle . . . guess I lost). I got my \"things\" but am \"I\" ready? I worked at my school library throughout the pandemic with only a handful of people at the school. Schools in a covid-19 pandemic will look different. Not everything has been sorted out, but it will look different. No surprise there- most of 2020 has looked different. We are in this together and we will get through it together. One of my favorite words is HOPE. I've had to rely on hope and prayer throughout the last number of years. Some call,it a mantra and I call it my 'mindful or intentional words'. Here they are \"hope anchors the soul\" It races to my mind when \"worries voices starts chirping\" to silence him. What words\/phrases calm you down, focus your soul, and give your brain a rest?  Take a bit of time and grab some intentional words, they'll be ready when you need them.  School is not going to be the same when we get back. It's going to be better. We are adaptable and resilient folk who will do our best to create teaching moments like we've never had to create before. Our kids (and staff too) need community, need love and caring. They\u2019ll want us to understand that they feel many of the same feelings we do : apprehension, anxiety, uncertainty, but we also know we have the most resilient children too. Join the conversation about stress and fears, of expectations and anxiety together.

This is forever my favorite picture of him. He\u2019s going back to school tomorrow. We loved our beautiful Montessori school. Well, we still do in theory. It\u2019s not the school we don\u2019t love. He\u2019s having shorter days, and is only going for half the week for a fall and spring semester. Probably an estimated 40 days total. My heart feels so heavy about it all. A third of those days are about 3 hours long. \n\nHe used to love it so much. Never, not once, did he get upset during drop off. He occasionally said bye and waved me off, but normally he couldn\u2019t even be bothered to, he was to busy loving playing with his friends.\n\nHe said he felt different trying to go to bed tonight knowing he has school in the morning. We talked about how it would be all outside, and his best friend would be there. That cheered him up a little bit, enough to finally fall asleep. He seemed distressed. My little social butterfly, doesn\u2019t want to leave home. I know in my mama heart it\u2019s because of how the world is shifting. While I know there so much delicious potential to sneak a lot of goodness in with this shift, moments like these remind me of how hard it still can be. Remember to talk to your kids about what their next step is and check in with them regularly on it. This world is scary enough for them. It\u2019s scary enough for adults.

We started something called Goat Happy Hour in 2015. GHH is basically getting outdoors in a beautiful farm setting, being surrounded by animals and distracting people from stress, illness or depression. Over the years it has helped give so many people happy distractions from what they were going through. At this crazy time, people need this more than ever.\n\nAt a time when it's probably difficult to see your patients over Zoom, phone calls or even in your office, we thought it would be the perfect time to invite you out to have your sessions with your clients on our farm! You can social distance, you can be out in nature and surrounded by animals and make the session memorable & something that they might even look forward to! We will not be charging for this. It will be a donation only basis and everything would be used to care for the farm and the the animals. Please look up @noregretsfarmsanctuary and if you and your clients would be interested in using our sanctuary for a meeting place please contact us! #goattherapy #goathappyhour #goathappyhouroregon #noregretsfarm #naturetherapy #mentalhealthactivities #mentalhealththerapist #mentalhealthcounseling #bentoncountyoregon #oregon #covid19 #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":82,"Hashtags":["#goattherapy","#goathappyhour","#goathappyhouroregon","#noregretsfarm","#naturetherapy","#mentalhealthactivities","#mentalhealththerapist","#mentalhealthcounseling","#bentoncountyoregon","#oregon","#covid19","#pandemic2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Original Goat Yoga‚Ñ¢Ô∏è in No Regrets Farm & Sanctuary.

Link to show in bio.\n\u2022\n\nThis painting is apart of a 7-portrait series of women writers exploring how violence and a longing for connection in both nature and human relationships is a catalyst to an awakening. Amidst the current pandemic, this series is relevant as we try to understand what\u2019s happening and look for ways to engage the future. This portrait of Flannery O'Connor, a collector of oddities and visionary, includes symbols of violence she used as a the catalyst for grace, and agents of change -- the bull that gorges and kills, and the fire that both destroys the wood and references the divine. The tattoo man both destructively seeks human connection with the lure of apples, then rejects it. In these uncertain times, I want this series to engage the local community as I explore how nature and a desire for human connection mirror one another, and the part violence and dystopia play to wake us up to reality.\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n#pandemic2020 #pandemicart #flanneryoconnor #flannery #portriatpainting #figurativeart #symbolicart #womenpaintingwomen #womenauthors #texasartist #artspace111 #texasnow #contemporaryrealism #tattooman #viewofthewoods #cleighholderart #artshow #artgallery #originalart #oilpainting #fortworthart #figurativepainting #artcurators #artcollector #poetsartists #southerngothic","NumberOfLikes":60,"Hashtags":["#pandemic2020","#pandemicart","#flanneryoconnor","#flannery","#portriatpainting","#figurativeart","#symbolicart","#womenpaintingwomen","#womenauthors","#texasartist","#artspace111","#texasnow","#contemporaryrealism","#tattooman","#viewofthewoods","#cleighholderart","#artshow","#artgallery","#originalart","#oilpainting","#fortworthart","#figurativepainting","#artcurators","#artcollector","#poetsartists","#southerngothic"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":15,"Timestamp":1598213903,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 22:18:23 CEST 2020","Location":"Artspace111"},{"Owner":"teslahername","CaptionText":"The cosmos is within us.

Over the past five months, the dollar has fallen 10 percent. Much of this depreciation comes from the central banks monetary easing, rising inflation expectation and gold price.\n\nThe pandemic itself has shown weakness in the U.S. dollar. The failure to contain the health crisis by the U.S. government along with the economic vulnerability that comes with it has contributed to the dollars decline. \n\nThe central bank has made decisions which have bettered the dollars position to combat depreciation. This includes currency swap lines with other central banks which give the dollar liquidity. At the same time, low interest rates were taken on to stimulate investment in a way to restore a competitive edge globally. So taking on a weaker dollar is necessary to have an attractive market for foreign investors. \n\nThe rising national debt along with fiscal stimulus continue to increase demand in foreign capital. Jerome Powell has also said they plan on keeping interest rates near the zero-lower bound until 2022. Considering this, the dollar faces a long road to reach its pre-pandemic levels. \n\nReported By: Project-Syndicate, Foreign Policy, Barron\u2019s","NumberOfLikes":9,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Economic News Today on August 23, 2020.

Reopening plans like this have already proven dangerous in other schools around the country, such as UNC-Chapel Hill, among others, which opened for a week before having a large outbreak and subsequent move to all online to prevent further spread. In an attempt to prevent this, UMKC has been doing a back-to-school safety drive to give students kits containing a mask, hand sanitizer, disinfecting wipes, and a card with measures to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. In addition, these tables are being used to hand out Student ID cards, usually handled in an office inside the UMKC Student Union, to help lower the number of people in the Student Union at one time. This has been a new process facilitated by having students email a picture for these cards rather than coming in to the Student Union and having these pictures taken.\n\nThe question of course remains, will this be enough?

I\u2019ve dug through every memory, experience, for good and for bad and perseverated unnecessarily. I\u2019ve worried every back to school during a pandemic worry. But for what? Where has it gotten me? Nothing and nowhere, and pretty exhausted!
