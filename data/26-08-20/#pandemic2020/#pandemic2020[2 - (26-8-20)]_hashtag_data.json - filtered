This entire year has both flown by and remained frozen at the same time. This morning I was thinking about how I never in my wildest dreams would think we would have to live our daily lives wearing face masks and living in constant fear. I rarely leave my house anyway,  but there is a difference between it being my choice to stay isolated and being forced to be. For those with debilating mental illness this swift change of life has been even more difficult. \nüíä\nBeing dumped by the love of my life of 18 years in 2014, losing my career of 10 years in 2016, losing all the friends that I made there, becoming disabled due to mental illness, a suicide attempt\/hospitalization last October, and then my dad passing away last November after a 2 year battle with cancer has been overwhelming to say the least. I've dealt with all of that, by hiding in my room. The fear of ever getting too close to anyone ever again, is so strong, that I would rather spend the rest of my days alone than ever allow myself to be hurt like that ever again. \nüè°\nI'm lonely sometimes, and wish I still had parties with friends, someone to share my experiences with, or even someplace to go when I need a change of scenery, but my peace of mind is worth more.  Parasocial relationships are the way of the future, I feel safe there.  #summer #dogdaysofsummer #pandemiclife \n.\n.\n.\n.\n#mentalhealth #coronavirus #lifestyle #friendship #loss #cancer #death #fired #divorce #heartbroken #disabled #disability #isolation #Depresion #bipolar #fear #pain #cutslikeaknife #sadness #relationships #familyovereverything #hurt #storytime #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife","NumberOfLikes":6,"Hashtags":["#summer","#dogdaysofsummer","#pandemiclife","#mentalhealth","#coronavirus","#lifestyle","#friendship","#loss","#cancer","#death","#fired","#divorce","#heartbroken","#disabled","#disability","#isolation","#Depresion","#bipolar","#fear","#pain","#cutslikeaknife","#sadness","#relationships","#familyovereverything","#hurt","#storytime","#pandemic2020","#pandemiclife"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1598150808,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 04:46:48 CEST 2020","Location":"Chesterfield County, Virginia"},{"CaptionText":"For everyone days or night #covid19 #friends #family #ordernow #youandme #pandemic2020 $10.00  only  TextNow üòä","NumberOfLikes":6,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#friends","#family","#ordernow","#youandme","#pandemic2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1598150752,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 04:45:52 CEST 2020","Location":"Atlanta, Georgia"},{"CaptionText":"üá∫üá∏ just watch, LISTEN, then think pls thx üò∑ #realtalk #reallife #thisisreallife #unreal #unbelievable #ignorance #ignoranceisnotbliss #ignoranceisachoice #ignorancekills #factsmatter #factsfirst #truthmatters #recallnewsom #dumptrump #maga #maga2020 #saywhatagain #covid19 #covid_19 #coronavirus #pandemic2020 #cnnnews #cnnireport #ac360 #donlemon #abc7eyewitness #abc7la #cbsla #foxla #ktla5news @foxla @cbsla @abc7la @ktla5news @vc_reporter @vc_star @cnn @cnntonight @donlemoncnn @andersoncooper @andersoncooper360 @gavinnewsom","NumberOfLikes":12,"Hashtags":["#realtalk","#reallife","#thisisreallife","#unreal","#unbelievable","#ignorance","#ignoranceisnotbliss","#ignoranceisachoice","#ignorancekills","#factsmatter","#factsfirst","#truthmatters","#recallnewsom","#dumptrump","#maga","#maga2020","#saywhatagain","#covid19","#covid_19","#coronavirus","#pandemic2020","#cnnnews","#cnnireport","#ac360","#donlemon","#abc7eyewitness","#abc7la","#cbsla","#foxla","#ktla5news"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":122,"Timestamp":1598150302,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 04:38:22 CEST 2020","Location":"Ventura Pier"},{"CaptionText":"Setelah membaca fakta di atas, kamu lebih pilih Roti apa Nasi?

There was no contract that we signed with reality that said \"when the going gets tough, this pandemic will just ease up because we know it's hard and you've earned it.\" All of those cons I mentioned above are things that make us uncomfortable. We have control over our comfort and you can do things to make the cons easier to manage and tolerate. \n\nI'm working on mask wearing with my 2 year old but she has trouble understanding it and it's going to take time. We don't leave the house at all other than for food, work, a walk outside, and school, and we've still been exposed directly to COVID multiple times. Wear your mask for her. Wear it for others who legit can't. Just because it's been 6 months and you're tired doesn't mean it's time to wrap up out efforts to slow the spread. The young and immune compromised are depending on you. Wear a mask, stay distant, WASH YOUR HANDS, get a flu shot, cough in your elbow, stay home when you are sick, limit contacts, get tested when you are feeling symptomatic or exposed, do all the things you know need to be done. We are all humans inhabiting this planet together. Do your small part, even if it's uncomfortable for you. Thanks for listening.\n.\n.\n.\n#covid19 #covidlife #coronaviruslife #cornavirus #covid_19 #pandemic #pandemic2020 #corona #wearamask #weareinthistogether #maskup #PSA","NumberOfLikes":19,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#covidlife","#coronaviruslife","#cornavirus","#covid_19","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#corona","#wearamask","#weareinthistogether","#maskup","#PSA"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Cait in Westside, Indianapolis.

These particles¬†\u201Cshow a more violent climbing tendency. The climbing speed is much faster than toilet flushing,\u201D explained Liu.\n\nSince urinals are more frequently used in densely populated areas, it can pose a serious health challenge.\n\n\u201CWearing a mask should be mandatory within public restrooms during the pandemic, and anti-diffusion improvements are urgently needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19,\u201D Liu added.\n\nEarlier, researchers of fluids at the same university had recommended closing the lid on toilets before flushing to prevent the spread of aerosols. They also recommended washing hands properly with soap after use.\n\n#CoronaVirus #outbreak #publictoilet #toilets #urinal #coronaalert #pandemic2020 #odishabytesnews","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#CoronaVirus","#outbreak","#publictoilet","#toilets","#urinal","#coronaalert","#pandemic2020","#odishabytesnews"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Odisha Bytes in Bhubaneswar, India.

It\u2019s a passion that is a big part of my every day life. \n...\nBack 5 years ago, I was surviving while taking care of and keeping my three kids (baby, 3 & 4 year olds) alive and well. I was totally #burnedout #depressed and #sleepdeprived because I was a mom of thousand trades while hubby was making the dough in South-Korea for 3-5 weeks at a time. \u201CStaying with it\u201D is an overestimation. I was run down. I felt like a train ran over me every single day- yet I kept on surviving. \n...\nI was also healing from a bilateral plantar fasciitis and had 4 months to train for my first #olympicdistancetriathlon ... i only had a mountain bike, didn\u2019t have any idea about swim workouts and could only run 20mins at a time. \n...\nYet I kept dreaming about \u201Cdoing\u201D the triathlon. It gave me a challenge, a purpose, a goal and a dream to reach for all in one. \n..\nWhen the day came, it was a balmy foggy day, +9c with windchill but I didn\u2019t care. I was loving every minute! \n..\nI swam 1500m in about 33mins, biked 44km in 1:37hrs:mins and ran 10k in about 52mins. I took my time in transitions, changing my clothes(!), had an amazing borrowed bike, and had no idea how to pace a 44k. My time was nothing spectacular but I was completely in love. I kept thinking to myself \u201CThis is the most fun I\u2019ve done in years!\u201D. When can I do this again? \n..\n5 years forward and I am still very much in love. My goals have grown from \u201Cdoing\u201D a triathlon to qualifying and racing at Ironman World Championships in Kona. The purpose if the same: to find the physical and mental limits of my body and mind while enjoying the sport and embracing the challenge. \n..\n#covid19 has changed a few things and one of them is that I am now coaching myself (yikes!!). I have huge appreciation for @elementsportscoaching for the last two years and for whipping me into a  immensely more confident and fitter athlete! I feel a bit like a teenager leaving home: a bit scared but confident in my own abilities and super excited for the new adventures ahead! \n...\n#onwardsandupwards despite #pandemic2020 \n...","NumberOfLikes":32,"Hashtags":["#throwbacksaturday","#triahlon","#burnedout","#depressed","#sleepdeprived","#olympicdistancetriathlon","#covid19","#onwardsandupwards","#pandemic2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Marjaana in Rotary Sunshine Park.

The majority of recently produced masks will not block a virus the size of a corona variety - you should not be sneezing, coughing, or spitting on a room to begin with (!).

The rumor in Interior Alaska is that we had the virus during our normal flu season, and nobody noticed the difference. Masks are a symbol of shame and fear throughout history, and, right now, are proof that the American people are willing to let mass media make crucial decisions for them. Stop the fear.

In response, I looked for as much information as possible on COVID-19 to try to map out a course for a return to normalcy how things would progress. I dutifully read news articles and obsessively checked the Johns Hopkins Covid-19 map, even taking screenshots so I could remember how the data was changing.¬†When we locked down, I thought, \"It's fine, I've been socially distancing most of my adult life. I'm not a people person; I'm built for this! Besides, I know a lot about economics, and I can help! I will research some theories to prevent a local economic meltdown. Maybe I'll even learn how to build custom cabinets!\u201D I thought I was optimistic.¬†Here's what I've learned:\n.\n1. Distracting yourself from things out of your control is a fool\u2019s errand. All of my plans in the early stages of the COVID pandemic weren't based in optimism, they were purely rooted in coping via distraction. I was gorging on information until I was literally too tired to think of anything else. I wanted to say \u201CGoodbye COVID fears and worries, there is no vacancy here!¬†This brain is full of thoughts on modern monetary theory, history of school facility design, vaccine trials, designs for a she-shed, homemade bread, aromatherapy, classical literature, gardening, woodworking or anything else, really.\u201D It didn\u2019t work and I'm exhausted.\n.\n2. We all need to find our own ways to disconnect and quiet our thoughts. This is really challenging for me, but I'm working on it. For me, there are two things that bring me peace: music and water.¬†So, I've banned podcasts and news talk from my morning walks. I have replaced the chatter with music. I have also taken up 5AM swims (sometimes just splashing around and doing handstands and flips in the water as I did as a kid). The pool is quiet and empty at that hour and it's dark, so there are no distractions.\n.\nWe live in a constant cycle of calm and chaos and sometimes the information that seems so helpful is too plentiful to function as anything more than consistent static. I'm learning to meter my intake and find ways to just \u201Csit\u201D with myself.\n- Amy¬†Ruthrauff-McWhorter¬†| 7\/20\/20","NumberOfLikes":6,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598045423,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 23:30:23 CEST 2020","Location":"Austin, Texas"},{"CaptionText":"The pandemic has interfered with the usual summer family interactions so every moment is treasured‚ù§ #familytime #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":33,"Hashtags":["#familytime","#pandemic2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598044752,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 23:19:12 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#coronavirus #corona #coronamemes #coronavirusmemes #covid19 #covid_19 #covid #pandemic #pandemic2020 #quarantine #stayhome #stayhomestaysafe #stayhomesavelives #wearamask #conservative #liberal #capitalism #usa #libertarian #marx #communism #communist #marxist #economy #massmurder #pyramidscheme #sos #jesus #church #christian","NumberOfLikes":4,"Hashtags":["#coronavirus","#corona","#coronamemes","#coronavirusmemes","#covid19","#covid_19","#covid","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#quarantine","#stayhome","#stayhomestaysafe","#stayhomesavelives","#wearamask","#conservative","#liberal","#capitalism","#usa","#libertarian","#marx","#communism","#communist","#marxist","#economy","#massmurder","#pyramidscheme","#sos","#jesus","#church","#christian"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Communist Drake on August 21, 2020.

What. a. year. As I\u2019ve been preparing for the fall semester, setting new goals and updating my teaching mission statement, I\u2019ve realized how important it is to distinguish between mid-pandemic goals and modified pre-pandemic goals.\n\nMid-Pandemic Goals:\nGoals that focus on what we can do right here, right now. It\u2019s a perspective shift to look at the current circumstances not as the glass being half full or half empty, but just as being, well, a new glass. It\u2019s approaching challenges with a fresh, expectant perspective, looking for new opportunities, new potential, new purpose.\n\nPre-Pandemic Goals:\nThese are the goals we had set when life was \u201Cnormal\u201D. Naturally we try to modify these goals to fit the current circumstances, but pushing and prodding the goals can ultimately result in smaller, less satisfying, and \u201Ctemporary\u201D versions of the original goals. It\u2019s not only an exhausting process, but it sets us up for disappointment and frustration, and what we may deem as failure.\n\nOf course setting aside prior goals is disappointing\u2014being in the middle of a pandemic is full of disappointments\u2014but by choosing to accept the loss and making a deliberate shift to step into a new chapter, we can confidently walk into this semester with a fresh, refined, and deeply rooted sense of purpose\u2014a purpose specifically for teaching music in the midst of a pandemic.\n\n. . . . .\n\nHow has goal setting looked different for you as you start this new semester?\n\nWhat goals have you been disappointed to set aside? What new goals are you excited to pursue?\n\n. . . . .\n\nThis year IS hard. The fears, uncertainties, and challenges we are facing are. really. hard. But thankfully we\u2019re not alone. In hopes of supporting, encouraging, and inspiring each other, I\u2019ll be sharing experiences and words of wisdom from different teachers in the upcoming weeks. So stay tuned.

It was also the first day I walked through Times Square since COVID19.

The spreadsheet seen above is from November 2019 and my categories have changed slightly since then. Budgeting is adaptable so I\u2019ve made tweaks over time.\n.\nüçáFOOD: Because I wanted to keep it easy for tracking I combine my food and my household items. I usually shop at Walmart so these purchases are combined and on one receipt. I don\u2019t want to deal with separating them when I get home. As a single person it\u2019s easy to add in the occasional toothpaste or dish soap purchase. However, I can see how if you have a family that food and household would need to be separate categories.\n.\nüê∂ANIMALS: Pets are expensive and committing to being a good pet owner means you know that going in. I have two cats and a dog that I\u2019m responsible for right now. My animal budget is food for both, litter, flea meds for all, toys, and occasional supplies like brushes. How I manage my animal expenses will be a separate post because there\u2019s a lot to talk about.\n.\nüí∞SAVINGS: Pretty self explanatory but this is any money that I save into sinking funds or my emergency fund. This is separate from my investments even though some think of it as saving for retirement.\n.\nüí∏BILLS: This category is large. It\u2019s rent, utilities, car insurance, phone bill, Internet, etc. If I had a mortgage payment then that would go under debt but since I\u2019m a renter, rent is a bill. These are recurring bills that don\u2019t go away and you never pay them off. I\u2019ll probably always have to pay for insurance, phone, and internet.\n.\nü©∫MEDICAL\/DENTAL: Again, obvious. I use this to pay for prescriptions, copays, other bills, bloodwork, dental cleanings, dental X-rays, etc. Another example is that I bought a thermometer this month and I put that under medical expenses. \n.\nüöóCAR: I use this for gasoline or car washes. I have a separate sinking fund for car repair and I use that if I need an oil change, new tires, things like that.","NumberOfLikes":9,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Emerald, PA-S on August 21, 2020.","NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598031609,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 19:40:09 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Follow @scrollhoop for more updates üíØ\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#scrollhoop #worldhealthorganization #who #coronavirus #corona #covid19 #stayhome #stayindoors #stayindoor #staysafe #pandemic #pandemic2020 #wearmask #instafriday #instadaily #instagood #russia #lebanon #lebanese #miakhalifa #america #donaldtrump #trump #blm #blacklivesmatter #sushantsinghrajput #bollywood #beirut #justinbieber #cristianoronaldo","NumberOfLikes":49,"Hashtags":["#scrollhoop","#worldhealthorganization","#who","#coronavirus","#corona","#covid19","#stayhome","#stayindoors","#stayindoor","#staysafe","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#wearmask","#instafriday","#instadaily","#instagood","#russia","#lebanon","#lebanese","#miakhalifa","#america","#donaldtrump","#trump","#blm","#blacklivesmatter","#sushantsinghrajput","#bollywood","#beirut","#justinbieber","#cristianoronaldo"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Scroll Hoop on August 21, 2020 tagging @who.

It can severely affect the heart, vessels, nerves, kidney, skin and brain. Studies have shown that SAR-CoV-2 can cause severe damage, even in patients with mild symptoms or those in recovery. Often this damage is detected very late or not at all. People recovering from symptoms noted trouble with concentration, confused thoughts, memory loss, loss of consciousness, seizures, loss of smell and taste, psychosis, anxiety, delirium, trouble focusing, etc. Researchers found that one-way COVID attacks the body is by causing inflammation and swelling of the brain. \n\nBecause of significant involvement of lungs (prolonged ventilators, tracheostomy and dyspnea), nerve damage, and nervous system dysfunction (encephalopathy, stroke, seizure, psychiatric changes, etc.) Cognitive, Speech, Language and Swallowing difficulties are observed in individuals positive with COVID-19. A Speech-Language Pathologist (SLP) can help with the mentioned problems.\n\n‚≠êCOMMUNICATION: When on ventilator\/tracheostomy and individual is unble to voice,SLP can provide with alternative methods of communication. Some individuals post stroke\/encephalopathy have slurred speech (Dysarthria) or language difficulty (Aphasia) which requires help with communication and expression.\n\n‚≠êSWALLOWING: Breathing tube, vocal cord damage, fluids in lungs, in-coordination or weakness of throat and oral muscles can cause significant swallowing difficulties and requires prompt intervention by an SLP.\n\n‚≠êCOGNITION: With cognitive functions (memory, problem solving, reasoning, attention etc) affected, an SLP can step in with strategies and early intervention.\n.\n.\n.\n#covid19 #covid19india #covid #coronavirus #pandemic #pandemic2020 #speechlanguagetherapy #speechtherapy #languagetherapy #swallowtherapy #dysphagiatherapy #slp #slpsofinstagram #speech #language #cognition #swallowing #aphasia #dysarthria #dysphagia #cognitiveimpairment #tracheostomy #ventilator #encephalopathy #memoryloss #lossoftasteandsmell #nervedamage #seizures #mumbai #fixmyspeech","NumberOfLikes":20,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#covid19india","#covid","#coronavirus","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#speechlanguagetherapy","#speechtherapy","#languagetherapy","#swallowtherapy","#dysphagiatherapy","#slp","#slpsofinstagram","#speech","#language","#cognition","#swallowing","#aphasia","#dysarthria","#dysphagia","#cognitiveimpairment","#tracheostomy","#ventilator","#encephalopathy","#memoryloss","#lossoftasteandsmell","#nervedamage","#seizures","#mumbai","#fixmyspeech"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by All About Speech Therapy in Mumbai, Maharashtra.

Empec√© a publicar en 2006, aunque varios a√±os antes ya escrib√≠a con esa intenci√≥n. Mi primera publicaci√≥n fue un poemario, luego vinieron algunas novelas, un libro de relatos, y desde 2012 tambi√©n trabajo en la literatura para ni√±os y j√≥venes. Como tallerista trabajo en un colegio y un liceo, y de forma particular con adultos. Como librero en librer√≠a Purp√∫rea los s√°bados y un rato los mi√©rcoles. \nEl trabajo de escritor siempre es un trabajo particular, ya que uno suele dejarlo para cuando tiene el resto de los trabajos resueltos. Lo que s√≠ se sinti√≥ a partir de marzo fue la diferencia en las ventas. Entre los miles de problemas econ√≥micos que derivaron de la pandemia est√° lo que gener√≥ en el mundo editorial: dejaron de comprarse libros, dejaron de editarse. Se gener√≥ (en el resto de los pa√≠ses contin√∫a) un problema a la hora de mandar manuscritos ya que frente a una crisis nadie sab√≠a qu√© hacer y eso detuvo la producci√≥n: lo que menos seguridad le daba a cualquier editorial era pensar en libros futuros. A esa incertidumbre le sum√© el seguro de desempleo en la librer√≠a y me adapt√© a nuevas formas de comunicarme a distancia con los chiquilines del centro educativo y con el grupo de taller de adultos.\nüëá üëá üëá üëá üëá üëá \n#pandemia #pandemic #pandemic2020 #covid_19 #covid_19uruguay #coronavirus #coronavirusuruguay #everydayuruguay #trabajo #trabajadores #fuerzadetrabajo #emergenciasanitaria #polticassociales #quedateencasa #discurso #realidad #fotodocumental #fotoregistro #fotoreportaje #cronicas #cotidianidad","NumberOfLikes":47,"Hashtags":["#pandemia","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#covid_19","#covid_19uruguay","#coronavirus","#coronavirusuruguay","#everydayuruguay","#trabajo","#trabajadores","#fuerzadetrabajo","#emergenciasanitaria","#polticassociales","#quedateencasa","#discurso","#realidad","#fotodocumental","#fotoregistro","#fotoreportaje","#cronicas","#cotidianidad"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by AnA cUeStA on August 21, 2020 tagging @pericoalcasotro.

Translation: approximately 5 million of Delhi's 20 million are immune to Covid. Similar surveys in Mumbai, Punjab also suggest ~25% seropositivity. \n\nüò∑ Vaccine Update: The government is thinking of procuring 5 million doses of Covid vaccines for frontline workers, Army personnel and other vulnerable groups. Which vaccine? We don't know. It's down to three as of now: Oxford University's, Zydus Cadila's or Bharat Biotech & ICMR's candidate. \n\nüò∑ City alert: In Mumbai, +ve patients older than 50 not allowed to home quarantine.

A meeting of community leaders ensued. \u201CThe house-fathers and masters met to consider what steps should be taken in regard to the smallpox.\u201D The solution was to move him out of town to the farm of a Moravian brother nearby. \u2063\n\u2063\nA smallpox epidemic began in Salem in 1866.
