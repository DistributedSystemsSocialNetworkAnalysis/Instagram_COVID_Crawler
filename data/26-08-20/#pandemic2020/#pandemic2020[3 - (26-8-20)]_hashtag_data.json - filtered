But sometimes the air roars, tossing over patio furniture and carrying trash across the mesa. Yet even that is nothing compared to the wind's full wrath when it picks up mounds of dirt and flings it across the neighborhood like a child might kick dirt in your eye during a tantrum. The dust disperses in enormous clouds, traverses the flat land carrying debris and biting sand in its teeth casting a haze over distant mountains like a filter blinding us from the outside world. \n\nI know that personifying wind is for poets but I can't help and wonder what caused the mercurial air to create such a fuss. The wind speaks. It sings through leaves and flapping flags and tinkling chimes. It moans through mountain peaks and canyons. It whispers through pages of my notebook, through window screens and fence posts. Believing the wind is trying to tell us something is anthropocentric, of course. Obviously it exists despite us. But, still, I wonder, what does it say?

She is on the spectrum, is highly sensory seeking, and suffers from adhd. She has taught me so much.\n\nI struggle most days to deal with her moods, behaviors, and idiosyncrasies . . . and then she bares her heart with her sweet moments, like when she sporadically decides it's a \"taking care of mommy\" night. Or her creative moments like the times when she is creating mini meals or full on birthday parties for her LOL dolls. I also adore the amazing bond she has with her sister.\n\nBut homeschooling this girl is hard, y'all. I am not patient and like all of you who are trying this, I worry that her needs will not be met. Some days it's hard to get her to do the work at all. But then there are the days like yesterday when she stayed focused on two pages worth of handwriting practice. It's in those moments that I feel like we're going to be okay.\n\nI also find that my child thrives in nature, so if you would like to learn how to use nature in your homeschooling, check out my latest blog post, which can be found in a link in my bio. Or, if you need general help with homeschooling your special needs child, I have a post filled with resources on that, too.\n\nWe can do hard things with trial and error, folks.

Both the Union and State governments have made a worse situation even more traumatizing and nightmarish. Many have lost their jobs, and the marginalized have no choice but to remain helpless and without assistance as the parasitical and hypocritical middle classes are complaining about trivial things when there are bigger fish to fry. \n\nAll of this building itself to become an unprecedented economic depression that would not only cause the loss of more jobs, but it may increase the misery of people that may either kill them by suicide or kill them through impoverishment. In any case, the Hindutva fascists and their ruling class masters are continuing - and will continue to - accrue more profits and more wealth at our expense, without ever coming in the way of harm like we would. \n\nSo what do we do? We have to overthrow this parasitic, cannibalistic and oppressive system that privileges over a few over the many millions of people of our country. We have to kick out those who sit on our wealth and their fascist watchdogs if we have to improve our lot and the lot of our people, experiencing the worst consequences of the pandemic and its aftermath!\n\nIt is time for a revolution, a New Democratic Revolution!\n\n#newdemocracy #newdemocraticrevolution #nationalliberation #revolution #win #pandemic2020 #economiccrisisinindia #unemployment #poverty #youthissues #needarevolution #migrantlabourerlivesmatter","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#newdemocracy","#newdemocraticrevolution","#nationalliberation","#revolution","#win","#pandemic2020","#economiccrisisinindia","#unemployment","#poverty","#youthissues","#needarevolution","#migrantlabourerlivesmatter"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by New Democracy Now!

Most people infected will experience a mild to moderate respiratory illness, whilst others will show no symptoms at all. However for some the effects are severe and longer lasting.\n\nOur aim in this yoga programme is to play some role in aiding the process of recovery. By only requiring the use of mostly basic props and furniture, we have tried to make the poses as accessible as possible for everyone.\n\nThe programme was compiled thanks to advice and guidance from Abhijata Iyengar, Lois Steinberg, Gulnaaz Dashti, Stephanie Quirk, the IY(UK) Therapy Committee, IY(UK) teachers who have experienced the virus themselves, and decades of work by BKS Iyengar and Dr Geeta S. Iyengar in medical classes at RIMYI in Pune.\n\nSee the link in our bio to access the video and booklet, which are both freely available. Please consider donating a contribution towards this and future Iyengar yoga therapy resources 🙏\n\nThanks to all involved in creating the programme and to @adrienne_karmaspaceyoga for designing the e-book\n\n#iyengaryoga #yogatherapy #covid19 #covid_19 #coronavirus #recovery #covidhelp #yogaforhealing #yoga #mypandemicsurvivalplan #sarscov2 #pandemic #pandemic2020 #staysafe #virus #postcovid #yogapractice #loveyoga #yogateachers  #iyengarmethod #yogadaily #practiceyoga #yogisofinstagram #yogajourney","NumberOfLikes":3,"Hashtags":["#Repost","#iyengaryoga","#yogatherapy","#covid19","#covid_19","#coronavirus","#recovery","#covidhelp","#yogaforhealing","#yoga","#mypandemicsurvivalplan","#sarscov2","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#staysafe","#virus","#postcovid","#yogapractice","#loveyoga","#yogateachers","#iyengarmethod","#yogadaily","#practiceyoga","#yogisofinstagram","#yogajourney"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by #learniyengar on August 19, 2020.
