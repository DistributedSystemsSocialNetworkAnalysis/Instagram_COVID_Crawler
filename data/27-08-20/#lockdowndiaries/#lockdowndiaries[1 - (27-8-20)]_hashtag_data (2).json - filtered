Although, we were aware that there will be a comma which is going to arrive in our lives but we didn't expect it to be such a long pause. You did become an unnecessary pause of our beautiful song called \"life\"\n At the beginning, it didn't seem to be this major issue instead we were hoping to enjoy those few days of leisure and get an escape from all the hustle. But life doesn't move as you want it to, so all the plans and enjoyment were doomed by your presence. We couldn't be able to do what we wanted, we wanted to live but you forced us to turn on the survival mode, more than a master of our own self we became a slave of your existence.\n The pressure was building on each one of us to try and get back to the normal but you made us realise that there won't be any normal, atleast for now or maybe ever. Now your presence has began to haunt people, some couldn't get bread while others are still on the survival mode. \n  There has been a lot of hatred for you, but just looking at that moonlight amidst those dark clouds helped me understand that maybe just for a mere instance some of your perks are somewhat a blessing in disguise. I know everything went from bright to dull in these past few months but you made us realise that there is something which is more important than those rush of life and that is our family and friends. You made us perceive the fact that there presence is of the utmost importance in our life, you enlarged everything in life for us and made us believe that all those things we were directly or indirectly taking for granted is an absolute luxury for us and we can't thank you enough for that. By pushing us at the end of the darkness you made us look at the brighter side of few things\nContinued in comments....","NumberOfLikes":15,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The Perennial in India.

We as humans can feel what others feel just by imagining it, just by watching a movie, that emotional trigger is set off\u2063\n\u2063\n🌟 There is a deeper part of us which wants to know that the other person is okay, and that we are okay. But sometimes it's forgotten through greed, jealously, inadequacy, hatred, rage.\u2063\n\u2063\n🌟 These can consume us and make us sick more than the corona virus, because its an ongoing sickness. Once you let compassion flood your system, and look at the world from this point of view. You will have direct positive.physiological changes, yes it's been shown in studies!\u2063\n\u2063\n🌟 You literally become better when put yourself in someone's shoes, and when you deeply feel their pain and their joy.\u2063\n\u2063\n🌟 We have all practiced compassion over lockdown in one way or another, sharing the burden, sharing how our experiences have gone, staying safe, nobody escaped lockdown and we were all in this together. No race, no country, no nothing was there to separate us. We had something in common with everyone\u2063\n\u2063\n🌟 As you ease out of lockdown, remind yourself of this something in common that you have with humanity, and take your compassion into everything you do. Try it for a week, the next time you feel enraged that someone is attacking you, ask yourself where in that person it's coming from, now how do you feel?\u2063\n\u2063\n🚀 Let me know how your life changes in this week.

The reviews all said the layer of banana between the ice cream and the crust made it super hard to cut so I opted for bananas on top instead! \n2. Replaced the layer of banana with a layer of chocolate to keep the crust crunchy! Check out fun facts for why 🤔\n\nTips and Tricks 🧑\u200D🍳\n1. Allow each layer of ice cream to complete freeze before adding the next layer to avoid flavours mixing! We waited WAY longer than the 20 minutes called for - closer to 2 hours!\n2. A silicon cake pan is perfect to use as it makes the pie so easy to remove! \n\nFun fact 🎁\nAs a Food Scientist one of my most memorable classes was the one where we learned about chocolate coating on the inside of ice cream cones sold ready to eat (like Drumsticks or Cornetto)🍦. The coating is fat-based so forms a barrier that stops the moisture from the ice cream moving to the cone and making it soggy. It's essential to a good Drumstick or Cornetto. Those that first put them on the market spent tons of time and money on scientists 👩\u200D🔬 to figure out a way to not let the chocolate pool at the bottom of the cone, only to find out after they did that people actually love the chocolate ends! 😅 \n\n#buzzfeedtasty #cupcakeproject #bananasplitday #bananasplit #bananasplitpie #bananaspliticecreampie #icecream #pie #pies #homemadepie #homemadepies #icecreampie #neapolitan #neapolitanicecream #neopolitanicecreampie #caramelisedbanana #caramelisedbananas #caramelizedbananas #caramelizedbananas #icecream #dessert #desserts #f52gram #cookingstories2020 #cuisine_captures #f52grams #3rookiecooks #melbournefoodie #quaranteam #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":436,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":95,"Timestamp":1598361202,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 15:13:22 CEST 2020","Location":"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia"},{"CaptionText":"Appreciation post for the most ganteng person in my eyes. \n.\nThank you, for holding my hands through ups and downs.\nThank you, for make a cup of tea or Indomie goreng in my busy school schedule.\nThank you, for letting me cut your hair (with a lot of consideration).\n.\n.\nI hope we will remember this time of 6 months of lockdown, hundreds fights, loving more.\n.\n.\nI\u2019m ready to be your hair dresser for the rest of your life.
