That was the only time he was carried out of the four walls of our home. He kept observing around and knew that the shops were shut, he wouldn't get any toys or chocolates on the go, no autos or buses around. Basically he knew everything and never did once throw tantrums about getting stuff for him. He found content and happiness visiting his naanu house, playing around with our pet dog there 🐕\n\n🌿 However lately, since the lockdown has been lifted and he has observed movement around, he keeps insisting on going out for a stroll or a ride or sometimes to just look out for cows every single day 🐄\n\n🌿 This was the first time I gave in to his demand and took him out; we visited this lake close by. Baby E held my hand all the time, there was nobody around except for one boy feeding the fishes.

It was a rude awakening that the pandemic is long from over. New lockdown in Auckland made our exit even more anxiety inducing. I was constantly in communication with our Airbnb host to ensure we can still stay there before our flight. Of course, I also worried about our flight being canceled the last minute. Worst of all I had to scratch my original plan of restaurant hopping in the city due to everything being closed in level 3 restriction.\n\nWe spent our last day of freedom getting haircuts for everyone.

How sweet is that! \n.\nMy earliest memories of these little golden rings is from the time slot of childhood in Solan, Himachal Pradesh. After Sunday Church Service in a tiny chapel inside our school, my parents would walk us 3 ducklings along into the market. Then into a little street off to the left, a mithaiwalla stirring his kadhai of glistening oil, scooping out huge Punjabi samosas, like a magician from a cauldron. Inside his shop, in a setup of maybe 4 tables with 4 chairs each, my father would get us either the samosas with tangy imli chutney (so typically north Indian), or the hot jalebis in a katori with milk. Sometimes both. Oh happy days! \n.\nJalebis in hot milk. Delicious beyond dreams.\n.\nAlso known as zulbia, jilapi, mushabak and zalabia, JALEBI is an Arab & Indian sweet snack popular all over South Asia, and the Middle East. It is made by deep-frying all-purpose flour batter in circular shapes, which are then soaked in sugar syrup. This dessert can be served warm or cold.\n.\n.\nExperiments in the time of Covid19.

I did some stories to go along with this about how everything in the kitchen is labelled and I don\u2019t want it to be like an institution but it\u2019s what helps us (mainly me) keep sane. Dougie doesn\u2019t care about where things go, it\u2019s not a priority to him and I\u2019m not going to force it to be a priority for him but it is to me. I was getting narky at him when things weren\u2019t in their spot and I felt shit about it because it\u2019s not his problem, plus there was no official spots for anything. So I had to come up with a solution and that was everything has a place and a label and there will be no more me getting mad at Dougie for no reason 😂 except there was a few \u201Cwhat the fuck is a ramekin?\u201D or \u201Chow do I know what a tapas dish is?\u201D The end of the day this stuff winds me up when I go to cook something and I can\u2019t find what I need and I have to ask, and I never want to get mad at Dougie for things  around the house (which is why we came up with a roster to share all chores equally because I don\u2019t like telling him what to do) Dougie is not lazy, he is so tidy. I often say I am clean but messy. I care about the detail, the walls being clean, fans dusted, drains clean etc but I don\u2019t mind if there is a pile of clothes that sit there for a week or if I leave the butter and milk out of the fridge. Whereas that drives Dougie crazy, he is tidy but would never think to dust the light shades or clean the light switches and door handles but he stands around me when I\u2019m cooking putting things away and cleaning the dishes as i cook 😂 we are made up differently but we want to live in harmony. Your partner doesn\u2019t have to care about what you care about but they have to respect it. Often our partners don\u2019t know half the things we do to run a household, until you write it down and split down the middle so they see what it takes for a clean, organised and happy home to run smoothly. Yes we wish that our partners will just do things without us telling them to do it, that would be ideal, but some people need guidance and that\u2019s ok. Once you make the list and split it, you don\u2019t have to talk about it ever again. 💕","NumberOfLikes":17,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598311723,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 01:28:43 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"1918 to 2020\u2060\n\u2060\n\u2060\n\u2060\n\u2060\n #staysafe #quarantine #lockdowngoals #stayhomestaysafe #lockdownday11 #lockdown #lockdownlife #lockdowndiaries\u2060 \u2060#history #pandemic #wearyourmask #facemask #facemaskmeme #wearyourmask","NumberOfLikes":25,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Munchable on August 24, 2020.

The cream may be aromatized with coffee, vanilla, or other flavourings. 🍮\n\nIts name literally means \u201Ccooked cream\".A bite of panna cotta is remarkably creamy, melting in the mouth without a trace of grittiness or lumps.\n\nSo I've been experimenting my flavours with this little gorgeous jiggle and it always manages to keep me content. \n\nMy inbox is currently loaded with so many messages asking me how to put up \"The perfect wobble\". The goal with panna cotta is to calibrate the amount of gelatin to the dairy and its fat so you achieve a firm set that is still delicate and wobbly.\n\nRecipie - (Serves 4)\n\nIngredients :\n1cup milk\n1cup cream\n3tbsp sugar\n1tsp gelatin\n4-5tbsp pineapple pulp\n1tsp vanilla essence\n\nHow to make a panna cotta ?\n\n1. Add 2tsp gelatin in 2tbsp water. Mix and keep it aside for 10min.\n2. Pour milk and cream into a saucepan and mix the sugar along, until it's dissolved.\nSet the saucepan over low heat and warm the milk gently, stirring or whisking frequently.\nDO NOT BOIL ! ❌\n2. Once the sugar has dissolved, add vanilla essence and the flavour. Stir this mixture.\n3. Add the gelatin to the saucepan and stir until the gelatin is dissolved.\n4. Strain the mixture and pour it into your ramekins.\n5. Keep the ramekins in normal temperature for 30min and then refrigerate for 5-hours or overnight.( Tip : The longer,the better ) 😉\n6. Run a thin knife carefully around the sides of a ramekin. Dip the ramekin in the warm water up to its rim, and hold it there for about 3 seconds.\nInvert the ramekin over the plate and shake gently to help it fall out. \n\nAnd Ta-Da, your panna-cotta is ready to be served ! 🤗\n\n#pannacotta #pineaplleflavoured #dessert #dessertsofinstagram #vegandesserts #homemade #lockdowndiaries #lockdowncooking #happiness #lovefordessertmaking #food #foodporn","NumberOfLikes":72,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1598289384,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 24 19:16:24 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"World is a MASQUERADE , everybody u meet is wearing a mask🎭\n.\n.\n#masquerade #oneofmybests #blacksketch #blackandwhite #worldisamasquerade #bestisyettocome #alwaysbegrateful #lovecreARTions #quarantinelife #lockdowndiaries #stayhomestaysafe #medicos #loveartwork #vifi👭 #rf🧚🏻\u200D♀️","NumberOfLikes":32,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by R&R in Home :).","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598287850,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 24 18:50:50 CEST 2020","Location":"Home :)"},{"CaptionText":"Online courses from Gopi Bahu institute...😅😅\n#onlinecourses #onlinecourse #lockdownmemes #lockdown2020 #lockdown #lockdowndiaries #lockdownlife #softwareengineer #software #softwaredeveloper #softwaredevelopment #expectationvsreality #expectation #reality #gopibahu","NumberOfLikes":26,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by mem3ngineers on August 24, 2020.

I have always been an isolated artiste, who enjoys the conversation with the world of non-humans. Odissi heightened my ability to connect with all the energies around me, be it the wind, birds or trees. I started to enjoy them more than the company of people and there were some powerful conversations that started with them.\nIn college as well, as a painter, I liked to paint the life of a pigeon, rows of daals queued up in the kitchen, the solitary handpump in the park. I think the life of the supposedly unimportant, and inanimate appealed to me always.\nI have been writing my dance thoughts more, seeing my thoughts more clearly. I re-visualized some of my dance-poems around the house. In a new setting, 'the home', that I experience so richly.  and constant dance events. SLOW, is my natural pace, and the drop of life's pace in the lockdown has simply echoed my mind. It has felt beautifully in sync with myself.\nLack of performance has not worried me, as performance is built upon the solid base of abhyaas and reflection. That's what I get to build in 2020. And in terms of dance teaching, I switched immediately to zoom classes, so my students have continued with our progress this year.\nI have been writing my dance thoughts more, seeing my thoughts more clearly. I re-visualised some of my dance-poems around the house. In a new setting, 'the home', that I experience so richly. \n\n@jayamehtadance is a multi-media artist, Odissi dancer, poet, writer & teacher. She dances the Odissi style of Guru Surendra Nath Jena, imbibed from her Guru Pratibha Jena Singh. She has penned a unique collection of dance-poems titled, 'The Poetic Saree', which has been danced at the India Dans Festival & the International Poetry Festival in the Netherlands, & filmed as 'The Poetic Saree Video project'.

Revision is so important!\n*\n📝Whilst focusing on what you're trying to learn is important, \nso is giving your brain time to make connections between what you are learning and your prior knowledge. Your brain will do this on its own. Often this results in \"shower thoughts\" because these connections form whilst we are relaxing. \n*\n📝Take regular breaks. Shorter periods of study improves focus and productivity.\n*\n*\n#nzeducation #onlinetutoring #onlinelearning #ncea #chemistrymemes #chemistrynotes #kiwigold #nceamemes #studygram #studymotivation #newzealand #lockdowndiaries #independentstudy #auckland #studentlifenz #highschoolstudent #highschoolnz #getprepared #memes #nceachemistry #examtime #exammadness #nzteen  #parentinghacks #onlineclasses #highschoolsenior","NumberOfLikes":8,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Online NCEA Chem Classroom on August 24, 2020.

I learned various forms for about ten years - jazz, hip hop, salsa and a few other Latin forms, dabbled in a bit of tap and belly dancing too - but it had been a long while since I've been in dance classes or performed. \n\nIt started in February during the initial phase of social distancing, which was hard on my ten-year-old niece when we choreographed a little routine to a song we both liked. Since then Cyra, a cheerful, positive child who found enough to keep herself busy, and I have been dancing together, though physically apart. It was just intended as a fun project to keep her busy during this time at home, but it went well. A pleasant by-product was that the home video we made got picked up by some international media, including Good Morning America. Once lockdown was announced in March and we couldn\u2019t visit each other anymore, we decided to keep going, getting together each evening on a video chat to rehearse different routines. A collaborative effort, we decide a song, discuss steps and then practice them together on a video call. It is dancing for fun, but also with some structure and a goal in mind, to learn the choreography & record a video of our synchronized steps together. We have completed ten so far, recording each one and sharing them on social media with friends and family. Through this, we have bonded, shared and learned more about each other and the music. \n\n@reemkhokhar  is a writer, contributing to various Indian and international publications on travel, culture, social issues, and writes personal essays. When not scribbling furiously, she spends most of her time choral singing, baking, dancing and indulging two adopted desi dogs.\nIf you or your artist friends have a story to share, connect with us.\n.\n.\n.\n#ArtistsLockedIn \n#Artistsupportartists #ArtistsoftheWorld #Dance #Cantstopthefeeling #ArtistsofDelhi #Lockdowndiaries #DanceDiaries #Jazz #HipHop #Togetherness #Saturdaydancemoves #saturdaynight #Adoseofhappiness #Sunshineinmypocket","NumberOfLikes":15,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1598095843,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 13:30:43 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"It's a simple platter of chole with rotis!

Many have started picking up their cameras to document some of these small, seemingly insignificant and significant moments of everyday life under lockdown.\n.\n.\n\nThe exhibition will be open from 11am-7pm 7 days a week. All precautions are being taken to ensure everyones safety. \n.\nMasks are mandatory inside the museum.

But this year is so strange - full of unfinished business. We've not been able to plan so much with our summer or book to take Eden on a city break for the first time. Usually I'd be cruising the Halloween section at TKMaxx already (for full time house decor obviously 🎃), but instead we're still avoiding town. It's not to complain - everything can wait and we've been perfectly happy slowing down that pace and making our own fun (even if the social restrictions were hard on everybody). But it's just odd to think about what's happened and what may continue to happen, and this strange \"new normal\" we're raising our children in. 🍁\nIn fact, this year seems to have flown by SO fast - is that just the strangeness of 2020 or is it simply due to having a 15 month old?! 🍂","NumberOfLikes":57,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Little Pack of Vegans on August 21, 2020 tagging @thenappyladyuk.

Two of my favourite novels of all time are \u2018To the Lighthouse\u2019 - sublime, elegiac; and \u2018Orlando\u2019 - hilarious, audacious, wise. But it\u2019s Virginia Woolf\u2019s diaries I return to again and again as to an old friend for comfort and delight, dipping in and out and never needing to read in chronological order. The way she wrestles with her work, her moods, her tricky balance between social obligations and solitary vocation; the cyclical nature of all things. \n\nTo watch a mind watching itself here is magic. \n\nThis ancient book is particularly precious to me because I\u2019m such a sentimental sap. @markustone found it in a secondhand bookstore in Clunes five ago and said, \u2018Hey, how about this? You like her don\u2019t you?\u2019 \nAnd I pounced upon it immediately, having never read her diaries before. It\u2019s old and battered, and because I\u2019ve loved it so well the cover was coming off. And now he has mended it and covered it with contact and it\u2019s rescued! True love, despite the fact he\u2019s never really cared to read much of her work himself 😆. \n\nI love how In this excerpt photographed VW is thoroughly sick of herself, and even of that beautiful book Orlando; how she detests her own \u2018volubility\u2019.

And this lovely Poster was created by me putting all the pics together.  The Positivity Video was also put together by me, with a Script written by Prochy Mistry and conceptualized with the help of all our SJK girls, Anjali Asudani, and our Pinkies, Vandana Mahajan, Nivedita Nihalaney Ruth Miranda Veronica Dcunha, with Prochy Master giving the final Voice over and me in the beginning.  The other girls in the video are Hiral Shah, Divya Venkateswaran Rupali Rohit Goshalia, Kala Lakra, Menaka Padmanabhan Sunke, Nidhi Mody and Lipika Savalkar.  A Big THANK YOU to Milind Soman  and Reema Sanghavi for this wonderful initiative which helped all our SJK girls to display their various talents.  And of course to Vaishnavi Naik and her USF Team for putting it all together so beautifully.  This has been a real Labour of Love and the end result has been worth it. I also wish to thank my dear friend, John Sokoloff, the brilliant Russian-American Composer for giving us permission to use his Music in our 2 Videos: (Her Slavic Soul in Rupali's Yoga Video for Anuradha Venkat and 'And So Here I Fall Again'  in our Positivity Video, by Sandhya.

Many of us have felt a lot of pressure to make the most of the time, to do the things we have never had time to do. I know very few people who were truly happy with what they achieved during lockdown. Now it\u2019s easing, the guilt & blame for not writing the book, redecorating the house, knitting a combine harvester, is huge. Society puts so much pressure on us to achieve, & to keep raising the bar, it can feel so overwhelming & make us feel at the bottom of the heap.\n\nLockdown was unlike anything any of us had ever experienced, everything was different, unknown, scary & very limiting in so many ways. Personally, just getting through it was achievement enough, managing to have some semblance of normal life was a major achievement. Now we are faced with an easing, but also a constant change of rules & doing things. Many people are feeling a bit stuck, not really able to get going, feel motivated & are struggling to focus.\n\nWe really should be allowed to take into account how much harder it is to do normal everyday tasks. Meeting up with friends... a minefield! Are we supposed to? Are we being irresponsible? Are bubbles still a thing, how do I manage that? Am I going to get told off, fined a ton of money, catch the virus? It wasn\u2019t like this before, now we have a lot of things to navigate.\n\nWe should start by letting ourselves off the hook a little, & celebrate getting any task done, if we do manage to do something productive, congratulate ourselves & make it as big as we can.\n\nIf we can allow it to be the case, that it\u2019s much harder now doing anything out there, maybe we can shorten our to do lists a bit & do a little dance every time we change the bed or send an email.\n\nI\u2019m doing a little dance as soon as I\u2019ve finished writing this. Having set out twice to go to the shops & have to come back because I forgot my face mask, things take longer & are more frustrating. Celebrate your wins, no matter how big or small!\n\nHas anyone else been struggling to stay motivated?","NumberOfLikes":24,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Mental Health Providers in London, United Kingdom.

It is a real charmer when dressed up with homemade thick custard and piped, chantilly cream. It adds an honest flavour with its rich sweetness and spongy caramelised texture, suggestive of a splendid dessert. Doubly so, it can be quietly savored at tea time. \n.\nServed with a superior vanilla ice cream, this should clinch the deal for a refreshing summery dessert. This swoony South African classic never becomes outdated. Pudgy berries are a prerequisite for it\u2019s many nutrients and its sweet-tart flavour to offset the sweetness, although any seasonal fruit may be used. \n. \nIt would be considered rude to decline these marvelous saucy puds. The only honorable thing to do, is brew a pot of tea and dispense plates around the table. \n.\nThis recipe is from my ebook - In the Kitchen with Paz, to shop, click the link in bio\n.\nFollow @foodiesof_cakewalk for more photos and ideas\/recipes.
