He chooses to be a sheepdog and signs up to become a Navy SEAL. He meets and marries Taya (#SiennaMiller), and after the 9\/11 attacks, he's sent to Iraq. His mission is to protect his fellow SEALs, but his skill with a rifle is so awesome that he eventually breaks the record for the most confirmed kills in military history. Chris goes on to become a legend in Iraq and keeps signing up for more tours of duty, much to the despair of Taya and their children. When Chris finally decides to come home for good, he finds he can't get the war out of his head -- until he discovers that helping other veterans and victims of PTSD brings him solace.\n______________________________\nTotally, It's a perfect balance - - The meaty action is show in a way you can always see what is happening, something unusual and refreshing in modern films. Although it's a true story, so you might think easy to tell, it takes an artist to tell it in a way that you are by his side throughout the film. It's not made to be over the top, blow your mind entertainment, it's much deeper. It sets out to share the life of a very unique man in a thoroughly entertaining way,Apart From Minor Flaws The Flim Lifts Off - - a recommended watch. \n\nRead more reviews @movieshut_\n______________________________","NumberOfLikes":269,"Hashtags":["#AmericanSniper","#BradleyCooper)","#SiennaMiller),"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @movieshut_ on August 20, 2020.

It has to be done to keep this country safe and I am 100% behind it. With that said, I had plans to visit my family back in Australia for my birthday at the end of this month, which I, of course, had to cancel when borders closed.  I was sad about it but moved forward and made other great plans with some truly special friends here. I believe in making the best out of situations that don't always go your way. So here I am all excited for a weekend of fun with friends and now we are back in lockdown and not coming out in time for those plans. I know the entire world is also being impacted by COVID and that I am not alone in this type of situation. I am trying really hard not to pity myself.  I had my afternoon of sulking and have now moved on again. I am taking this as a message from my ancestors and the universe that I need to use the time off that I was going to spend celebrating and stay home and get my work done.  I will have about a week off from work and will not be able to leave unless accessing essential services.  What does this mean? Seven consecutive days where I can focus all of my energy on my art, projects, and any other aspect of my business that needs tending to.  Instead of being sad, I am trying to be appreciative of the time and a safe and comfortable home to be able to focus and accomplish tasks towards my goals. But to be honest, deep down I'm still a bit sad about the cancelled party plans.\n\nHow has COVID impacted your life? How are you getting through these times?

I want to remind myself of all the hurdles I\u2019ve overcome and the wins (both small & large) that I\u2019ve had during this time. As someone with chronic ill health, my battles are daily, and yet I will always jump (or crawl if needs be) to an opportunity to uplift myself, and in turn, others. My #wearyourhappy mantra was borne of a necessity to create, to reflect and to stubbornly hold onto who I was despite such gruelling and life altering illness and treatment regime. And whilst I am not cured, I am truly at peace within myself and hope that even the smallest of smiles appears on your face seeing me embrace life with a little fun & colour, in direct defiance of the troubles both near and far. Today I wore purple eyeshadow and embraced my wild hair & colourful ensemble to face the world. It helped. A lot. I\u2019ve learned it\u2019s perfectly ok to voice what you need to not only survive, but to thrive. And it\u2019s not just ok, it\u2019s a necessity to honour yourself first and fore most. Not only will it become a life long habit, it will also teach others how you need to be treated. We all want to be seen & accepted. And if you don\u2019t- it\u2019s because you\u2019re yet to accept yourself. That\u2019s at the heart of it. Pure, indulgent, life-giving self love.

The space was very nascent with not much development other than a massive push in the shrimp farming sector. After spending 4 months to set up a shrimp farm which hadn't been used for over 2 years I was able to turn an unused farm to a perfectly functioning one, finally putting in the seedlings for cultivation, spending multiple long nights stressing about water conditions, having quite a few crocodiles wandering into the farm. Hundreds of ferry rides later we were coasting to the finish line, when the monsoons decided to change the tune. \n\nFor three days we watched the River Mandovi rise and recede until it finally covered the entire farm and as it receded, took all the shrimp with it. Wading through waist deep water I was devastated, but wasn't ready to give up just yet. \n\nA year, multiple ferry rides, a pandemic and just the one crocodile later, I've finally got the shrimp to the size of my palm and closed up the farm for the season. It's been a good 6 months in these strange times and an interesting journey from start to finish. Now, as the monsoons make their own music, I can finally focus on my album and all the moments of Goa that I've wanted to capture through sound and photographs. The next shrimp season promises to be just as challenging and exciting!\" said Sumehr Gwalani\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#goa #lockdowndiaries #pandemic #shrimpfarm","NumberOfLikes":1312,"Hashtags":["#goa","#lockdowndiaries","#pandemic","#shrimpfarm"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":18,"Timestamp":1597727452,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 18 07:10:52 CEST 2020","Location":"Goa"},{"CaptionText":"Paneer Tikka at Homeüè†‚ù§Ô∏è\n\n#hungry #foodislife #foodporn #foodie #foodie \n#hungrygirl #delhi #delhifoodie \n#hungry #foodislove #foodislife #delhifood #foodgasm #foodaholic #foodporn #nomnom #delhifoodie #soulfood #myfav #cheese #cheeselove  #hungertriggers #foodastic10 #3mondr #foodislove247 #yummyinmytummy #myfoodgali #myfoodgasm #yumyumeateries #lockdowndiaries #paneerrecipes #paneertikka #stayhome #staysafe","NumberOfLikes":178,"Hashtags":["#hungry","#foodislife","#foodporn","#foodie","#foodie","#hungrygirl","#delhi","#delhifoodie","#hungry","#foodislove","#foodislife","#delhifood","#foodgasm","#foodaholic","#foodporn","#nomnom","#delhifoodie","#soulfood","#myfav","#cheese","#cheeselove","#hungertriggers","#foodastic10","#3mondr","#foodislove247","#yummyinmytummy","#myfoodgali","#myfoodgasm","#yumyumeateries","#lockdowndiaries","#paneerrecipes","#paneertikka","#stayhome","#staysafe"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Food Is LoveüçΩ‚ô•Ô∏è in Delhi, India with @suhuthapar, and @crafthardsweatglitter.

I usually start while I\u2019m preparing breakfast. Our everyday bread for the children is a very simple white loaf that I make in my KitchenAid. This is a recipe I\u2019ve been using on and off for 13 years, and is adapted from \u2018The Cook\u2019s Companion\u2019 by Stephanie Alexander. \n\nI use 1kg bread flour, 2 tbsp olive oil, 1 tbsp dry yeast, 1tsp salt and 600ml warm water. Throw it all into the bowl of the mixer and knead with the dough hook for ten minutes. Move the dough to a large oiled bowl, cover with a tea towel, and leave to rise for about an hour. Knock the dough back, divide in half and place in two oiled bread tins to rise another 30-45 mins. Bake at 220c for 25 mins. You can remove the loaves from the tins for the last five minutes of baking for a crunchier crust.\n\nI\u2019ve made this recipe using 20% wholemeal flour and 100% wholemeal and they both work well. If you want to use 100% wholemeal you may need to bake a little longer. \n\nI make pizza dough once a week for lunches, and once or twice a week I may also make buns or another bread. This morning I tried this Milk Bun recipe from @locallovely \u2018s \u2018A Basket by the Door\u2019. (This is an amazing cookbook by the way, one of my favourites!)\n\nNeither my husband or I can actually eat any of these breads I regularly bake. I\u2019m hoping to begin experimenting with gluten-free sourdough soon, but for now I make a GF cornbread every few weeks and Evan snacks on that. \n\nThe best bread that you can eat, health wise, is a long-fermented sourdough loaf. I have had seasons of regularly baking sourdough, but I\u2019ve had to accept that in my current season I can\u2019t keep a starter alive. These simple yeast breads fit into my daily routine, only require about ten minutes of hands-on preparation time, and are still a much better choice nutritionally than store bought loaves. (I\u2019d rather not feed my kids soy flour, vegetable oils and questionable additives, thanks!)\n\nLet me know your favourite bread to bake, and also if you\u2019d like more posts like this, sharing some of the details of how we feed a large family. ‚ò∫Ô∏è","NumberOfLikes":102,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":22,"Timestamp":1597714249,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 18 03:30:49 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Lockdown bketi\n\n#lockdowndiaries #lockdown2020 #lockdownlife #lockdownhouseparty #lockdownmemes #dankmemes #lockdownindia #lockdownvibes #lockdownactivities #bsdk\n#stayhome #stayhomestaysafe #chodagang #staytuned #staycinematic #stayhere #gandu #hutiyapa #coronavirusmemesüòÇüòÇüòÇ #coronatime \n#mediamemes #hahaha #funnyshit #funnymeme #jokeredit #hasleyindia #bakchodbaba #bakchodbilli #bakchod_nation #chutiyapa","NumberOfLikes":19,"Hashtags":["#lockdowndiaries","#lockdown2020","#lockdownlife","#lockdownhouseparty","#lockdownmemes","#dankmemes","#lockdownindia","#lockdownvibes","#lockdownactivities","#bsdk","#stayhome","#stayhomestaysafe","#chodagang","#staytuned","#staycinematic","#stayhere","#gandu","#hutiyapa","#coronavirusmemesüòÇüòÇüòÇ","#coronatime","#mediamemes","#hahaha","#funnyshit","#funnymeme","#jokeredit","#hasleyindia","#bakchodbaba","#bakchodbilli","#bakchod_nation","#chutiyapa"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597713983,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 18 03:26:23 CEST 2020","Location":"Uttrakhand"},{"CaptionText":"When its Covid and Common Cold outside,  treat yourself with a vibrant, warming and healthy  soup packed with immunity supporting essentials. \n\nThis Quick- to- assemble soup is made with a forage of  greens which includes Curry leaves,  Ginger leaves,  Marsang \/Jati Malkathi leaves ( Panicled Spot Flower ), Biholongoni or Bilongoni Paat ( Pteridium aquilinum ) and Maan dhoniya paat or Long Coriander ( Eryngium foetidum ).\n Chunks of chicken are added along with ginger-garlic paste , pepper and red chillies for a satisfying pungent taste. \nThis soup is highly nutritious and beneficial for boosting our immunity.

I come from a big, close family - and being away from them was really difficult. \n\nI remember one time, I was walking through a shopping centre outside London, and suddenly I felt a wave of uncontrollable emotion rush over me. I stood in the middle of the walkway, and cried. It was unexpected (and let\u2019s face it, a little awkward), but I couldn\u2019t control it. I missed home.\n\nI may be at home now, but I\u2019ve felt those waves a lot lately. Because a home isn\u2019t just about the four walls and roof over our heads. A home isn\u2019t just about the scenery we take for granted every day as we go about our lives. A home isn\u2019t just about the things that make it a place to feel secure and safe. \n\nHome, for me, is about people. The people who make my little place in the world feel content, warm and comforting. Like home. \n\nMy Mum\u2019s cooking that instantly injects me with love and my Dad\u2019s ridiculous jokes that have us rolling our eyes and laughing simultaneously. That feels like home. \nMy little brothers and sisters, our dynamic and our banter\u2026 that\u2019s home.\nSeeing my beautiful friends, and drinking bubbles, talking our heads off, practicing impossible TikTok dances, and dancing on tables as we laugh all night\u2026. that\u2019s home. \nWaking up before the sun each day, jumping in the car to the gym and moving my body with people who uplift and inspire me\u2026 that\u2019s home. \nSeeing my children play with their friends, and run through our house laughing and playing with their little buddies\u2026 that\u2019s home. \nPopping across or down the road to my neighbours\u2019 house for a quick cup of tea and a chat (or a cheeky Friday champagne)\u2026 that\u2019s home. \nSeeing my nieces and nephews, and the children of my beautiful friends grow up and play with my kids... that\u2019s home. \nWalking through our village on a Sunday when the Farmer\u2019s Market is on - buying local produce and seeing cafes so busy their customers are spilling out on the streets as they happily waiting for their coffee in the sunshine\u2026. that\u2019s home. \n\n(Continued in comments)....","NumberOfLikes":63,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":40,"Timestamp":1597658938,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 12:08:58 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Monday morning project...\n#pantry\n#CapeTown \n#lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":10,"Hashtags":["#pantry","#CapeTown","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1597658853,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 12:07:33 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Brad Ascalon Studio's approach to furniture and product design has always been about reducing an object to the essential, to only that which is necessary to benefit that object\u2019s function and its manufacturability, while assuring that the aesthetics are driven by those tenets first and foremost.

Here are 5 accessories that can make your ensemble look complete and effortless. #nomoreconfidential \n.\n.\n.\n1. A watch adds an elegant and classy  look to your outfit. \n2. A delicate necklace highlights your neck and pulls together your plain outfit, making it look chic. \n3. An ear cuff will add high doses of charm and grace to your look. It's a great alternative if you aren't into hoop earrings.\n4. A clutch is as practical as it is beautiful. Add a bright clutch to your neutral ensemble to make it pop. \n5. Break the monotony of an outfit with the help of a belt. Use simple belts for formal occasions and an accessorised one for a fun and bubbly look. \n.\n.\n.\nTip: when it comes to accessories, I always believe less is more. \n.\n.\n.\nFor more ideas ans suggestions do follow @wardrobe_confidentials \n.\n.\n.\n#accessoriesoftheday #neutralstyle #lessismore #chic #delecatepieces #formalorinformal #yourpick #outfitinspiration #outfitoftheday #fashion #fashionstyle #fashionblogger #fashionista #style #styleinspo #styleinspiration #styleoftheday #lockdown #lockdownlife #lockdowndiaries #loveyourself #bodypositivity #popofcolor #beyourself #wardrobestylist #wardrobe #wardeobegoals","NumberOfLikes":16,"Hashtags":["#nomoreconfidential","#accessoriesoftheday","#neutralstyle","#lessismore","#chic","#delecatepieces","#formalorinformal","#yourpick","#outfitinspiration","#outfitoftheday","#fashion","#fashionstyle","#fashionblogger","#fashionista","#style","#styleinspo","#styleinspiration","#styleoftheday","#lockdown","#lockdownlife","#lockdowndiaries","#loveyourself","#bodypositivity","#popofcolor","#beyourself","#wardrobestylist","#wardrobe","#wardeobegoals"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597654586,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 10:56:26 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Focus on the little things rather than waiting for something big to come along or happen for you to be grateful for. üí´üí´","NumberOfLikes":145,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Chanel Sudarski in Elwood, Victoria, Australia with @glassons, and @chanelsudarski.

We had such a great response and the results were way way better than we could have planned for.

How am I contributing? \n\nIf you ever felt that way at some point during this lockdown, please know that you can help by following the rules and staying at home. So please make sure you stay indoors, take care of your family and support your loved ones. Reach out (on your phone) to your loved ones. This lockdown will be easier if you have someone to communicate with. There is no better time than this to reach out to someone and be there for someone.\u201D\n\nThank you @sadon_lhamo for these lovely words.

A people\u2019s favourite and the one we look forward to all week. Here in the UK, a Sunday roast is a highlight for many.  For us, it makes no difference really.  Today I cooked homemade \u2018frikaddelle\u2019 packed with flavour.  I roasted some beautiful coloured carrots, sauteed broccolini in garlic butter, a bit of white rice with fresh parsley and some humble sweet potato mash. Simples.  I love creamy sweet potatoes taken a step beyond mashed: I like them whipped until they\u2019re impossibly creamy and fluffy, cooked in a cozy bath of milk with cinnamon, plenty of toasty butter and finishing them with a light dusting of brown sugar. Not your average roast, but oh! so homely and deliciously wholesome. #food #homecooking #delicious #hometreats #wholesome #lessismore #sundaylunch #goodfood #foodie #cooking #ilovecooking #addinglovetoeverymeal #foodofinstagram #eat #frommylittlekitchen #lockdowndiaries #lockdowndaywhatever","NumberOfLikes":12,"Hashtags":["#food","#homecooking","#delicious","#hometreats","#wholesome","#lessismore","#sundaylunch","#goodfood","#foodie","#cooking","#ilovecooking","#addinglovetoeverymeal","#foodofinstagram","#eat","#frommylittlekitchen","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdowndaywhatever"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by frantuck in Trowbridge, Wiltshire.

Then horror which we used to read in past came in reality for this generation... Pandemic. \nLockdown was imposed in short interval notice and in a snap sound of fingers, many found themselves jobless, trapped inside. Privileged as me just had to get ourselves keep confined to our spaces. Real struggle was for them whose life started daily with sunrise and bread earned by long day hard work. Now there was no work.\nAs a photographers' perspective, shoots got cancelled, project delayed or denied. After a few days of not shooting, we started searching way to pursue passion. Business meetings started on conference video calls. Few photographers came with a temporary solution of shooting on video calls. Facetime shoots, WhatsApp Call shoots, Google video shoots, Skype shoot came in existence... in a shell, Virtual Shoots. Ofcourse not good as actual shoot, but \"...dil ko khush rakhne ko ghalib ye khayal achchha hai...\", it became a trend amongst photographers.\nAfter initial denial, me too thought to give it a try. Talked to few people connected with me. Now I am sharing few results. \nI won't call myself as Photographer for these shots, just a director. \n--- \u2022\u2022\u2022 ---\nIn picture: @dikshadesire\n--- \u2022\u2022\u2022 ---\n#virtual #shoot #virtualshoot #facetime #facetimephotoshoot #whatsapp #videocall #portrait_vision #pictureoftheday #photooftheday #pursuitofportraits #portrait_today #portrait_mood #portraitphotography #portrait_shots #portraiture #mood #moodygrams #snapseed #lockdowndiaries #lockdown #coronatime #portraitvision_ #pr0ject_uno #pr0ject_soul #portraitphotographer #couch #red #faceshot #expression","NumberOfLikes":37,"Hashtags":["#virtual","#shoot","#virtualshoot","#facetime","#facetimephotoshoot","#whatsapp","#videocall","#portrait_vision","#pictureoftheday","#photooftheday","#pursuitofportraits","#portrait_today","#portrait_mood","#portraitphotography","#portrait_shots","#portraiture","#mood","#moodygrams","#snapseed","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdown","#coronatime","#portraitvision_","#pr0ject_uno","#pr0ject_soul","#portraitphotographer","#couch","#red","#faceshot","#expression"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597505708,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 17:35:08 CEST 2020","Location":"India"},{"CaptionText":"Cup of Joeü§é‚òï\n\n#coffeelover #coffeeaddict #barristalife #espressolove  #caffeinedaily #coffeefirst #coffeeoclock #elixir is #coffeequotes #coffeesesh #coffeemania #coffeemaniac #coffeeeveryday #lockdowndiaries  #coffeeaddict  #caffeineaddict #caffeinated  #coffeesesh #cofeelovers #coffeewoman #capuchino","NumberOfLikes":6,"Hashtags":["#coffeelover","#coffeeaddict","#barristalife","#espressolove","#caffeinedaily","#coffeefirst","#coffeeoclock","#elixir","#coffeequotes","#coffeesesh","#coffeemania","#coffeemaniac","#coffeeeveryday","#lockdowndiaries","#coffeeaddict","#caffeineaddict","#caffeinated","#coffeesesh","#cofeelovers","#coffeewoman","#capuchino"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by bronzed_affair on August 15, 2020.

I love films that are about folks testing themselves, following a dream, doing something that peels away the layers of \u2018the self\u2019 you think you know.\nThis quote resonated with me deeply and really got me thinking.\n\n\u2019How important is it in life not necessarily to be strong but to feel strong, to measure yourself at least once, to find yourself at least once in the most ancient of human conditions, facing the blind, deaf stone alone, with nothing to help you but your own hands and your own head....\u2019\n\nWhen I first heard these words I immediately thought of birth. How by just looking at me at certain points in my labour you may have thought I was weakening, that I was losing my will or ability to birth my baby.  What you wouldn\u2019t have seen (and sometimes it was also lost to myself) was the deep, embedded connection and trust I held in birth and in my intuition.  So although my strength and trust was felt deep in my bones, it was not always shown outwardly or felt consciously by me ...and that was ok... because it lead me to face a challenge that would take no prisoners!! There was no way through it other than through it, no way but to trust that deep knowing that birth belongs to women, that unless my intuition told me something was deeply wrong, I was the only one that could see me through, with my \u2018own hands and my own head\u2019! \nIt reminded me of this awesome quote by Yolande Norris-Clarke of @freebirthsociety \u2018Birth will decimate you, and that\u2019s one of its gifts\u2019!\nThe gift being the knowledge that you are stronger than you have the capacity to understand. \n\nThe quote from \u2018Into The Wild\u2019 obviously wasn\u2019t written about birth as it was written by a man! I would imagine that for him it was about adversity and coming through it via expression and release and trust and determination.\nThese are very testing times we are living through at the moment and sometimes I don\u2019t feel strong at all.  But I keep putting one foot in front of the other as that\u2019s all we can do.  So please know, even if you aren\u2019t feeling strong, YOU ARE, because you are still here.
