From the person who used to stay out 14hrs a day on average to the person who haven\u2019t even seen the roads for a month or two straight, not even to get groceries was an interesting turn of events. But I must say I am loving this now. I see a number of people putting out posts on social media about how they hate staying at home and not being able to meet their loved ones, and all fidgety to go back to that NORMAL life we had. I miss my other family consisting two people; girls with whom at least meeting every other fortnight was as necessity as breathing but it\u2019s been almost half a year that I have seen their faces and nothing feels miserable compared to that. I am a barista who hasn\u2019t had a sip of coffee since I volunteered to be on unpaid leave. And what is a barista without coffee eh? I was in a relationship where I felt drained even if it was just for few number of months and I ended up calling it off. I was so afraid to talk about it that deep inside I wished him to vanish rather than confrontation. Because I am never the bearer of bad news but the receiver. I was always at the other end of spectrum. I have cut off ties with people to whom my absence doesn\u2019t mean anything. I have limited my arena to such extent where now I only communicate with people who cares about my wellbeing. Was it that easy? Oh hell no! There were times where I was just gone  because nothing I said to them made me feel understood. I like to steer the wheel of my life hence, I distanced myself from people I love so that I can reach to my own conclusions. My friends always disliked that part of me, but they understood me too. At one point, finally this pandemic crawled under my skin and made me go insane. \n\n#tobecontinued #journaling #writing #writersofinstagram #booklover #tumblr #explore #pandemic #lockdowndiaries #novice #writerslife #thoughtsbecomethings","NumberOfLikes":2,"Hashtags":["#tobecontinued","#journaling","#writing","#writersofinstagram","#booklover","#tumblr","#explore","#pandemic","#lockdowndiaries","#novice","#writerslife","#thoughtsbecomethings"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Oona 🍁 on August 13, 2020.

This photo is of such times, where he ended up only photo bombing all the photos.

Popular in herbal culture from Charlemagne, who ordered his people to grow it, to the Pharisees, 2,000 years of Japanese menthol harvesters, to the Romans who brought it with them as they marched through Europe and into Britain.\n\nToday I discovered, most excitingly, that it has an origin story in Greek Mythology (and we all know I love a Greek Myth 🌝). Two stories; the first is that the nymph Minthe was being chatted up by Hades, much to the jealousy of his queen Sephony who turned the nymph into a plant, Mint. The second, that unlucky in love Minthe, was beloved by Pluto, who turned her into a scented herb after his jealous wife took umbrage. Poor gal! \n\nBut she\u2019s now a wonder herb, and menthol has become probably the most ubiquitously used herbal derivative we have in modern times, from toothpastes to chewing gum, \u2018Minty Fresh\u2019 has come to mean clean and healthy. But I feel like that marketing ignores so many fundamental properties that Mint has; a fierce antiseptic, calmative, anti-spasmodic, anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, anti-parasitic, a stimulant. It works to soothe nervous headaches, increases concentration and is known to relieve gastro-intestinal disorders.\n\nSo an all rounder really, I\u2019ll post some options soon! \n\n#mintplant #thegreenplace #lockdowndiaries #londongardens #herbalremedies #brockley","NumberOfLikes":8,"Hashtags":["#mintplant","#thegreenplace","#lockdowndiaries","#londongardens","#herbalremedies","#brockley"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Potions from the Garden in Brockley.

For 20 odd years, summer holidays meant visiting my family in Kerala. Last year, I went to England to study. As part of my Montessori training, I decided to attend the practical workshop sessions in London. It was a deliberate choice. They offered the same in Dubai but I decided to take on an adventure & to move away from the usual norm. And it was the best decision of my life. Though my family accompanied me to Tamworth, the quaint little town where my sis in law lives, I spent two whole weeks living on my own & exploring London. Though a bit frightening initially, I discovered facets of my personality that was always in the shadows because I never needed them in the forefront. Above all else, I learned to enjoy my own company. To allocate time to enjoy what I enjoy. I went to theatres, walked into art museums, travelled from one end of London to the other on the tube, drank a lot of tea and ate a lot of scones! \n.\n.\nEvery morning, before the start of my class, I would go to a tea house- & eat freshly baked scones. The lady there showed me how to break it at the middle & spread clotted cream & jam and I was hooked! So every day, without even going to the counter to order, she would serve me hot tea and her warm scones and I would be in bliss... I languished in the slowness of time in England. There was no hurry, no need to be elsewhere. Just to be in the moment & to savour it. \n.\n.\n\n#art #artist #drawing #artwork #love #photography #painting #illustration #instagood #artistsoninstagram #sketch #photooftheday #arte #like #instagram #beautiful #draw #follow #nature #picoftheday #photo #instaart #music #fanart #watercolor #lockdowndiaries #travelmemories #watercolorjournal #recipeillustration","NumberOfLikes":113,"Hashtags":["#art","#artist","#drawing","#artwork","#love","#photography","#painting","#illustration","#instagood","#artistsoninstagram","#sketch","#photooftheday","#arte","#like","#instagram","#beautiful","#draw","#follow","#nature","#picoftheday","#photo","#instaart","#music","#fanart","#watercolor","#lockdowndiaries","#travelmemories","#watercolorjournal","#recipeillustration"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":18,"Timestamp":1597299567,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 13 08:19:27 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"antiiirose","CaptionText":"Lockdown day 538596937 unpacking day 3 🙄 #lockdowndiaries #letmetakeaselfie","NumberOfLikes":19,"Hashtags":["#lockdowndiaries","#letmetakeaselfie"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Ant 🧿 on August 12, 2020.

For a 4 year old that is quite difficult to succumb too. And yet, its marvelous to see them adapt to the times. \n\nSome of the changes I have noticed in the Bear during this time are:\n\n🧸Taking care of himself and others around him because he sees how all the adults are so particular about looking after each other now.\n\n🧸Incredible understanding of how germs are dangerous, why you need to sanitize, why you aren't supposed to touch anyone when they get back home, how you can't touch anything that just came from outside.\n\n🧸Cleaning up after himself because Mamma and Dadda does too, that it is your responsibility. But also, asking for help if you are too tired 🥺\n\n🧸Desire to help in chores because everyone is equally involved. Especially when he sees both Mamma and Dadda cook together.\n\n🧸Loss of routine did happen. Although there are a few daily favorites that he makes sure to attend to, like going to his grand parents next door exactly at 6 pm everyday 😄\n\n🧸The increase in screen time. But also the increase in the reading sessions, the imaginative play and even the cuddle times 🥰\n\nOh well, whatever that can get us through these terrible times work, don't they?\n\nTell us how you and your family have been handling the days in quarantine.\n\n#lifeinthetimeofcorona #quarantinestories #lockdowndiaries #lifewiththebear #grizzlyezra #grizzlybear #momsofinstagram #mommyhoodunplugged #momlife #growinguptoofast #littleman","NumberOfLikes":179,"Hashtags":["#lifeinthetimeofcorona","#quarantinestories","#lockdowndiaries","#lifewiththebear","#grizzlyezra","#grizzlybear","#momsofinstagram","#mommyhoodunplugged","#momlife","#growinguptoofast","#littleman"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Biji Basheer on August 12, 2020.

And today, ALL OF THE FEELS, as we head into lockdown 2.0. ⠀\n⠀\nYour feelings and emotions are 100% valid and okay. Please feel them, feel them and release them. Sit with them and allow yourself to move through them. ⠀\n⠀\nI wondered how I could offer some support and so I wanted to share a few things to consider to support yourself through this time:⠀\n⠀\n✨ One of my favourite mantras \u201CThis too shall pass\u201D is a wonderful way to give yourself permission to fully feel the feelings and know they are not permanent. ⠀\n⠀\n✨ Meditation 🧘\u200D♀️ a wonderful way to drop out of your head and into your body, into your heart and intuition. ⠀\n⠀\n✨ Journaling - I\u2019m a huge fan of journaling for so many different reasons! It\u2019s a great way to \u2018get stuff out\u2019, to help you release the feeling and process them. It\u2019s also a lovely way for your loving intuition to come through towards the end of the journal session with some loving words of wisdom and compassion. ⠀\n⠀\n✨ Be gentle with yourself. You\u2019re human, you\u2019re here having a human experience on earth. ⠀\n⠀\n✨ Reach out for support. Reach out to loved ones, friends, colleagues, coaches, healers and ask for what you need. ⠀\n⠀\nAnd lastly, please know that I am ALWAYS here for you. I know it can be a bit strange of social media and we forget there\u2019s real humans behind these squares, but please hear me when I say, I see you, I am here for you, I love you 💖","NumberOfLikes":36,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by EVIE ~ Life & Confidence Coach in Auckland, New Zealand.

But it\u2019s also the unconditional love of seeing your sons and daughters bond more over the day and hug and role play because they are their only playmates and so make the best of things.👧👶👧\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s that love that comes from seeing your eldest try and teach your youngest how to write their name or numbers out because it\u2019s how you\u2019ve been teaching your eldest so they assimilate (albeit on the loving room wall rather than the paper you just put in front of them). So my lengthy point is that my kids have been inspirational and helping me to learn new ways to see life through lockdown with their positive outlook and ability to have new experiences as a good thing!

The pre-recorded interviews take place via Zoom and are posted every Tuesday afternoon. You can find them all on the Different Strokes website, Facebook page and YouTube channel but over the past few weeks, a snippet of each already posted to the DS channels has also been posted to our feed to briefly introduce our wonderful Instagram audience and to give everyone a taster of personal affiliation with each survivor.\n\nLockdown interview number eleven has a different take as it features stroke survivor Genise - our Family Support Officer - and Mary, the wife of Russell who, aged 56, had an ischaemic stroke in 2017 and a haemorrhagic stroke three weeks later. Mary speaks about Russell\u2019s long road to recovery and her journey to becoming his number one support. She speaks about her personal feelings towards the label \u2018carer\u2019, how it took her a while to seek help because of that, how both their lives have changed dramatically, how their relationship has been affected and how they get through it as a couple with the steps and goals to keep trying, keep going and keep being busy. She talks about how both herself and Russell have compensated their active life now a big chunk is lost to his post stroke seizures, fatigue, loss of speech and poor mobility, how they\u2019ve implemented exercise in their routine and devised their own program, and how Covid has interrupted that - along with accessible holiday planning. She also chats about what they\u2019ve been up to during lockdown, how face to face communication online has been a saving grace, and how the Different Strokes groups has been an invaluable lifeline along with the light it brings to both Russell\u2019s rehab and Mary\u2019s role.\n\n Catch the full interview at:\n🔗 https:\/\/differentstrokes.co.uk\/stroke-survivor-experiences-during-lockdown\/\n▶️ https:\/\/youtu.be\/nNBMW414umk\n👍🏼 https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/differentstrokescharity\/","NumberOfLikes":15,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597144651,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 11 13:17:31 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"sangitas_kitchen_","CaptionText":"Paneer butter masala 😍😋 swipe ⏭️\n✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨\nFollow : @sangitas_kitchen_\nFollow : @sangitas_kitchen_\nFollow : @sangitas_kitchen_\n\n#yummyfood#delicious😋 #pleasefollowback\n#yummyfood #yummy #homecooked #homecookedmeals#cookingathome #cookingwithlove #tasty #tastyrecipes #foodiesofinstagram #foodphotography #foodie_features #foodiegram #foodiesofinsta#pleasefollowback #followfollow #followback #followforfollowback#homemade #lockdowncooking #lockdowndiaries #lockdownsessions #paneerbuttermasala #paneermakhani #paneerbuttermasala🍲 #paneer #sangitas_kitchen_","NumberOfLikes":94,"Hashtags":["#yummyfoo","#delicious😋","#pleasefollowback","#yummyfood","#yummy","#homecooked","#homecookedmeal","#cookingathome","#cookingwithlove","#tasty","#tastyrecipes","#foodiesofinstagram","#foodphotography","#foodie_features","#foodiegram","#foodiesofinst","#pleasefollowback","#followfollow","#followback","#followforfollowbac","#homemade","#lockdowncooking","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdownsessions","#paneerbuttermasala","#paneermakhani","#paneerbuttermasala🍲","#paneer","#sangitas_kitchen_"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":33,"Timestamp":1597144644,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 11 13:17:24 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"onesecretingredient","CaptionText":"Garlic noodles\n#garlic #noodles #snack #snacks #snacktime #snackideas #snacking #snackinghealthy #foodphotography #foodporn #foodstagram #healthyfood #healthylifestyle #green #eat #eathealthy #eatclean #eatlocal #oneplus #oneplus7t#quarantine #quarantinelife #quarantineandchill #chef #cheflife #foodlover #lockdown #lockdown2020 #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":35,"Hashtags":["#garlic","#noodles","#snack","#snacks","#snacktime","#snackideas","#snacking","#snackinghealthy","#foodphotography","#foodporn","#foodstagram","#healthyfood","#healthylifestyle","#green","#eat","#eathealthy","#eatclean","#eatlocal","#oneplus","#oneplus7","#quarantine","#quarantinelife","#quarantineandchill","#chef","#cheflife","#foodlover","#lockdown","#lockdown2020","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @onesecretingredient on August 11, 2020.

Someone who comes to our rescue when we are in danger, the one who we can count on. \n\nIf we were to pick our favorite heros, for some they would belong to the reel life while for some they would come from different walks of real life. No matter who we choose to idealise, we look upto them, we strive to become like them, and measure our success in the same terms as theirs. \n\nAll in true spirit! But if I have to ask you, what's heroism to you, what would you say? Webster dictionary defines heroism as,  'heroic (courageous or brave) conduct especially as exhibited in fulfilling a high purpose or attaining a noble end'. Well it does takes to be more than ordinary to qualify as a hero, right? \n\nIf your answer to the above question is yes, then am sorry but I beg to differ. I think we have raised the benchmark a little too high to escape from realising our own responsibilities. We have labelled some tasks to be larger than life so that we can escape by being lazy or perhaps sloppy. \n\nHeros are ordinary people who act out of true honesty and dedication towards their duties. A teacher looking out for it's student's well being is a hero. A Doctor taking care of it's patients is a hero. A public servant carrying out his duty with utmost honesty is a hero. A mentor helping it's people grow is a hero. If you stay true to what you signed up for, you are a hero! \n\nThis one's dedicated to all those ordinary people who are loyal to their duties and are helping us sail through these difficult times. Kudos to you and thanks for inspiring us to be the heros of our own lives! \n\n#Day25 #lockdowndiaries #lockdownlearnings #seriesend #last postintheseries #itsawrap #lockdown #pandemic #corona #thistooshalpass #staysafe #stayindoors #heros #iamahero #ordinary  #notsoordinary #shividoodle #doodle #writing #lovewriting #lovemore #onceawriteralwaysawriter #doodlethoughts #randomthoughts #newnormal","NumberOfLikes":20,"Hashtags":["#Day25","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdownlearnings","#seriesend","#last","#itsawrap","#lockdown","#pandemic","#corona","#thistooshalpass","#staysafe","#stayindoors","#heros","#iamahero","#ordinary","#notsoordinary","#shividoodle","#doodle","#writing","#lovewriting","#lovemore","#onceawriteralwaysawriter","#doodlethoughts","#randomthoughts","#newnormal"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Shividoodle in Bangalore, India.

The pandemic has shifted my perspective on my life immensely and now I am finally able to look at everything under a different light.

I came across her Instagram profile a few weeks ago and I loved the way she danced and in the process presented her body. I messaged her asking if she would be interested in doing a collaborative virtual choreography with me. She agreed and as time progressed, I eventually got to know that she has danced extensively with @sonali.bhadauria and @svetanakanwar , which was very intimidating. \n\nHowever, Asha didi\u2019s sweet nature kept me going and it was a fun process. Even while wearing several hats of being a mom, managing work and home life, it is amazing to see how Asha didi manages to keep dancing as her top priority. In the past few days, she taught me patience and how to work with it. She helped me with my dance process. \n\nHere is to another collab, of this very catchy and breezy song.
