From the person who used to stay out 14hrs a day on average to the person who haven\u2019t even seen the roads for a month or two straight, not even to get groceries was an interesting turn of events. But I must say I am loving this now. I see a number of people putting out posts on social media about how they hate staying at home and not being able to meet their loved ones, and all fidgety to go back to that NORMAL life we had. I miss my other family consisting two people; girls with whom at least meeting every other fortnight was as necessity as breathing but it\u2019s been almost half a year that I have seen their faces and nothing feels miserable compared to that. I am a barista who hasn\u2019t had a sip of coffee since I volunteered to be on unpaid leave. And what is a barista without coffee eh? I was in a relationship where I felt drained even if it was just for few number of months and I ended up calling it off. I was so afraid to talk about it that deep inside I wished him to vanish rather than confrontation. Because I am never the bearer of bad news but the receiver. I was always at the other end of spectrum. I have cut off ties with people to whom my absence doesn\u2019t mean anything. I have limited my arena to such extent where now I only communicate with people who cares about my wellbeing. Was it that easy? Oh hell no! There were times where I was just gone  because nothing I said to them made me feel understood. I like to steer the wheel of my life hence, I distanced myself from people I love so that I can reach to my own conclusions. My friends always disliked that part of me, but they understood me too.

Popular in herbal culture from Charlemagne, who ordered his people to grow it, to the Pharisees, 2,000 years of Japanese menthol harvesters, to the Romans who brought it with them as they marched through Europe and into Britain.\n\nToday I discovered, most excitingly, that it has an origin story in Greek Mythology (and we all know I love a Greek Myth üåù). Two stories; the first is that the nymph Minthe was being chatted up by Hades, much to the jealousy of his queen Sephony who turned the nymph into a plant, Mint. The second, that unlucky in love Minthe, was beloved by Pluto, who turned her into a scented herb after his jealous wife took umbrage. Poor gal! \n\nBut she\u2019s now a wonder herb, and menthol has become probably the most ubiquitously used herbal derivative we have in modern times, from toothpastes to chewing gum, \u2018Minty Fresh\u2019 has come to mean clean and healthy. But I feel like that marketing ignores so many fundamental properties that Mint has; a fierce antiseptic, calmative, anti-spasmodic, anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, anti-parasitic, a stimulant. It works to soothe nervous headaches, increases concentration and is known to relieve gastro-intestinal disorders.\n\nSo an all rounder really, I\u2019ll post some options soon! \n\n#mintplant #thegreenplace #lockdowndiaries #londongardens #herbalremedies #brockley","NumberOfLikes":8,"Hashtags":["#mintplant","#thegreenplace","#lockdowndiaries","#londongardens","#herbalremedies","#brockley"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Potions from the Garden in Brockley.

For 20 odd years, summer holidays meant visiting my family in Kerala. Last year, I went to England to study. As part of my Montessori training, I decided to attend the practical workshop sessions in London. It was a deliberate choice. They offered the same in Dubai but I decided to take on an adventure & to move away from the usual norm. And it was the best decision of my life. Though my family accompanied me to Tamworth, the quaint little town where my sis in law lives, I spent two whole weeks living on my own & exploring London. Though a bit frightening initially, I discovered facets of my personality that was always in the shadows because I never needed them in the forefront. Above all else, I learned to enjoy my own company. To allocate time to enjoy what I enjoy. I went to theatres, walked into art museums, travelled from one end of London to the other on the tube, drank a lot of tea and ate a lot of scones! \n.\n.\nEvery morning, before the start of my class, I would go to a tea house- & eat freshly baked scones. The lady there showed me how to break it at the middle & spread clotted cream & jam and I was hooked! So every day, without even going to the counter to order, she would serve me hot tea and her warm scones and I would be in bliss... I languished in the slowness of time in England. There was no hurry, no need to be elsewhere. Just to be in the moment & to savour it. \n.\n.\n\n#art #artist #drawing #artwork #love #photography #painting #illustration #instagood #artistsoninstagram #sketch #photooftheday #arte #like #instagram #beautiful #draw #follow #nature #picoftheday #photo #instaart #music #fanart #watercolor #lockdowndiaries #travelmemories #watercolorjournal #recipeillustration","NumberOfLikes":113,"Hashtags":["#art","#artist","#drawing","#artwork","#love","#photography","#painting","#illustration","#instagood","#artistsoninstagram","#sketch","#photooftheday","#arte","#like","#instagram","#beautiful","#draw","#follow","#nature","#picoftheday","#photo","#instaart","#music","#fanart","#watercolor","#lockdowndiaries","#travelmemories","#watercolorjournal","#recipeillustration"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":18,"Timestamp":1597299567,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 13 08:19:27 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"antiiirose","CaptionText":"Lockdown day 538596937 unpacking day 3 üôÑ #lockdowndiaries #letmetakeaselfie","NumberOfLikes":19,"Hashtags":["#lockdowndiaries","#letmetakeaselfie"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Ant üßø on August 12, 2020.

These days, seeing the store-bought vegetables that are either rotten or stale, I wonder whether I should quit the job and start farming instead. To get fresh and non-toxic vegetables, one needs to put in their own efforts. Along with it, watching @manju.warrier's movie 'how old are you?', made a strong will in me to start growing veggies even if it's small level. Three months hence, to see one of my cute tomatoes turn red, there's immense happiness. Even if my 'farm' cannot guarantee a sack of vegetables, the efforts got paid off. \n\n#tomatoes #organicgardening #organicfarming #homegrown #balconygarden #kochidiaries #tomato #gardenlife #organic #farminglife #homegardens #vegetablegarden #vegetablegardening #lockdowndiaries #meengurrymemories","NumberOfLikes":27,"Hashtags":["#tomatoes","#organicgardening","#organicfarming","#homegrown","#balconygarden","#kochidiaries","#tomato","#gardenlife","#organic","#farminglife","#homegardens","#vegetablegarden","#vegetablegardening","#lockdowndiaries","#meengurrymemories"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Meengurry on August 11, 2020 tagging @gardenup.in.

So my lengthy point is that my kids have been inspirational and helping me to learn new ways to see life through lockdown with their positive outlook and ability to have new experiences as a good thing!

The pre-recorded interviews take place via Zoom and are posted every Tuesday afternoon. You can find them all on the Different Strokes website, Facebook page and YouTube channel but over the past few weeks, a snippet of each already posted to the DS channels has also been posted to our feed to briefly introduce our wonderful Instagram audience and to give everyone a taster of personal affiliation with each survivor.\n\nLockdown interview number eleven has a different take as it features stroke survivor Genise - our Family Support Officer - and Mary, the wife of Russell who, aged 56, had an ischaemic stroke in 2017 and a haemorrhagic stroke three weeks later. Mary speaks about Russell\u2019s long road to recovery and her journey to becoming his number one support. She speaks about her personal feelings towards the label \u2018carer\u2019, how it took her a while to seek help because of that, how both their lives have changed dramatically, how their relationship has been affected and how they get through it as a couple with the steps and goals to keep trying, keep going and keep being busy. She talks about how both herself and Russell have compensated their active life now a big chunk is lost to his post stroke seizures, fatigue, loss of speech and poor mobility, how they\u2019ve implemented exercise in their routine and devised their own program, and how Covid has interrupted that - along with accessible holiday planning. She also chats about what they\u2019ve been up to during lockdown, how face to face communication online has been a saving grace, and how the Different Strokes groups has been an invaluable lifeline along with the light it brings to both Russell\u2019s rehab and Mary\u2019s role.\n\n Catch the full interview at:\nüîó https:\/\/differentstrokes.co.uk\/stroke-survivor-experiences-during-lockdown\/\n‚ñ∂Ô∏è https:\/\/youtu.be\/nNBMW414umk\nüëçüèº https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/differentstrokescharity\/","NumberOfLikes":15,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597144651,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 11 13:17:31 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"sangitas_kitchen_","CaptionText":"Paneer butter masala üòçüòã swipe ‚è≠Ô∏è\n‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®\nFollow : @sangitas_kitchen_\nFollow : @sangitas_kitchen_\nFollow : @sangitas_kitchen_\n\n#yummyfood#deliciousüòã #pleasefollowback\n#yummyfood #yummy #homecooked #homecookedmeals#cookingathome #cookingwithlove #tasty #tastyrecipes #foodiesofinstagram #foodphotography #foodie_features #foodiegram #foodiesofinsta#pleasefollowback #followfollow #followback #followforfollowback#homemade #lockdowncooking #lockdowndiaries #lockdownsessions #paneerbuttermasala #paneermakhani #paneerbuttermasalaüç≤ #paneer #sangitas_kitchen_","NumberOfLikes":94,"Hashtags":["#yummyfoo","#deliciousüòã","#pleasefollowback","#yummyfood","#yummy","#homecooked","#homecookedmeal","#cookingathome","#cookingwithlove","#tasty","#tastyrecipes","#foodiesofinstagram","#foodphotography","#foodie_features","#foodiegram","#foodiesofinst","#pleasefollowback","#followfollow","#followback","#followforfollowbac","#homemade","#lockdowncooking","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdownsessions","#paneerbuttermasala","#paneermakhani","#paneerbuttermasalaüç≤","#paneer","#sangitas_kitchen_"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":33,"Timestamp":1597144644,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 11 13:17:24 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"onesecretingredient","CaptionText":"Garlic noodles\n#garlic #noodles #snack #snacks #snacktime #snackideas #snacking #snackinghealthy #foodphotography #foodporn #foodstagram #healthyfood #healthylifestyle #green #eat #eathealthy #eatclean #eatlocal #oneplus #oneplus7t#quarantine #quarantinelife #quarantineandchill #chef #cheflife #foodlover #lockdown #lockdown2020 #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":35,"Hashtags":["#garlic","#noodles","#snack","#snacks","#snacktime","#snackideas","#snacking","#snackinghealthy","#foodphotography","#foodporn","#foodstagram","#healthyfood","#healthylifestyle","#green","#eat","#eathealthy","#eatclean","#eatlocal","#oneplus","#oneplus7","#quarantine","#quarantinelife","#quarantineandchill","#chef","#cheflife","#foodlover","#lockdown","#lockdown2020","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @onesecretingredient on August 11, 2020.

Someone who comes to our rescue when we are in danger, the one who we can count on. \n\nIf we were to pick our favorite heros, for some they would belong to the reel life while for some they would come from different walks of real life. No matter who we choose to idealise, we look upto them, we strive to become like them, and measure our success in the same terms as theirs. \n\nAll in true spirit! But if I have to ask you, what's heroism to you, what would you say? Webster dictionary defines heroism as, ¬†'heroic (courageous or brave) conduct especially as exhibited in fulfilling a high purpose or attaining a noble end'. Well it does takes to be more than ordinary to qualify as a hero, right? \n\nIf your answer to the above question is yes, then am sorry but I beg to differ. I think we have raised the benchmark a little too high to escape from realising our own responsibilities. We have labelled some tasks to be larger than life so that we can escape by being lazy or perhaps sloppy. \n\nHeros are ordinary people who act out of true honesty and dedication towards their duties. A teacher looking out for it's student's well being is a hero. A Doctor taking care of it's patients is a hero. A public servant carrying out his duty with utmost honesty is a hero. A mentor helping it's people grow is a hero. If you stay true to what you signed up for, you are a hero! \n\nThis one's dedicated to all those ordinary people who are loyal to their duties and are helping us sail through these difficult times. Kudos to you and thanks for inspiring us to be the heros of our own lives! \n\n#Day25 #lockdowndiaries #lockdownlearnings #seriesend #last postintheseries #itsawrap #lockdown #pandemic #corona #thistooshalpass #staysafe #stayindoors #heros #iamahero #ordinary  #notsoordinary #shividoodle #doodle #writing #lovewriting #lovemore #onceawriteralwaysawriter #doodlethoughts #randomthoughts #newnormal","NumberOfLikes":20,"Hashtags":["#Day25","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdownlearnings","#seriesend","#last","#itsawrap","#lockdown","#pandemic","#corona","#thistooshalpass","#staysafe","#stayindoors","#heros","#iamahero","#ordinary","#notsoordinary","#shividoodle","#doodle","#writing","#lovewriting","#lovemore","#onceawriteralwaysawriter","#doodlethoughts","#randomthoughts","#newnormal"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Shividoodle in Bangalore, India.

Exercise can easily become a mindfulness activity if you shift your thoughts about how you approach it.\n\nIf you see it as a way to connect with your body and become more aware of your own physical abilities, you can lessen some of your resistance to it. For many people, simply initiating exercise for just a few minutes is enough to get the ball rolling. Just beginning anything you mentally resist is 95% of the battle.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have time for a full exercise routine in the morning, just devote ten minutes to moving and warming up your body to get your blood and energy flowing.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#hikingadventures #mindfulness #meditation #meditations #hikingculture \n\n#meditationtime #hikingtrails #hikinglife #hikingvibes #dancinggirl \n\n#dancingpartner #meditationquotes #mindfulnessmoment #lockdowndiaries #meditationroom \n\n#mindfulnesseating #fitnessjourney #mindfulnessforchildren #fitnessmom #meditationtips \n\n#meditationtools #daddancing #hiking_my_life #dancingislife #meditationlife \n\n#budhist #meditationdaily #movementmeditation #yogameditation #slowlymindfullysilently","NumberOfLikes":6,"Hashtags":["#hikingadventures","#mindfulness","#meditation","#meditations","#hikingculture","#meditationtime","#hikingtrails","#hikinglife","#hikingvibes","#dancinggirl","#dancingpartner","#meditationquotes","#mindfulnessmoment","#lockdowndiaries","#meditationroom","#mindfulnesseating","#fitnessjourney","#mindfulnessforchildren","#fitnessmom","#meditationtips","#meditationtools","#daddancing","#hiking_my_life","#dancingislife","#meditationlife","#budhist","#meditationdaily","#movementmeditation","#yogameditation","#slowlymindfullysilently"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @slowlymindfullysilently in Dandenong Creek Trail.

Even while wearing several hats of being a mom, managing work and home life, it is amazing to see how Asha didi manages to keep dancing as her top priority.
