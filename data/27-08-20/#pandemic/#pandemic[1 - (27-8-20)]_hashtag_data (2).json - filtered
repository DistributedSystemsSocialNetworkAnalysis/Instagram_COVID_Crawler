WHO had launched the ambitious polio eradication campaign in Africa 24 years ago in 1996. At that time, polio had paralysed roughly 75,000 children on the continent each year. The continent's last known case was in August 2016. Since then no case of wild polio has been reported.\n\nThe job was made easier by the partners Rotary immediately attracted: the WHO, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and UNICEF. Tens of 1000s of health workers have dedicated their lives to fighting polio throughout Africa.\n\nThe achievement is the result of massive vaccination drive and surveillance efforts undertaken by the healthcare workers and the international community. Today\u2019s victory over the wild poliovirus in the African region is a testament to what can happen when partners from a variety of sectors join forces to accomplish a major global health goal. It is something that the world can and should aspire to during these turbulent times.\n\nThis is a momentous milestone for Africa.

In the next blog in our series, we delve deeper and explore the differences in how men and women responded to the crisis.\n\n#RealisedStrengths \nWomen saw an increase in their #Service and #Gratitude realised strengths. They drew strength in crisis by going above and beyond to #supportothers and %helpingpeople in any way they could to make a difference to their situation or #challenges. Nothing was too much trouble. Women also appreciated the small things and gained a real sense of perspective in what was important in their life. #Resilience was drawn from a refocus of values, a welcome to commute less for work and a simple gratitude of our health.\n\nMen saw an increase in their #Centred and #Humour realised strengths. Keeping calm under the #stress and challenges during those first few months was most needed. Men were focused on bringing a sense of reassurance to others\u2019 situations with the right words in the right way. Another great coping strength was being able to see and bring a humorous side to darker times by bringing smiles and fun to people.\n\nBoth genders were skilled in their resilience and able to apply their strengths to support themselves and each other during that initial #turbulenttime.\n\nWatch our webinar recording \u201AHow the World's Strengths Changed During Covid\u2019 to find out more about the research and our findings. ‚ùóÔ∏èLink in bio \n#strengthstogether @cappfinity #strengthsprofile","NumberOfLikes":3,"Hashtags":["#strengths","#men","#women","#Covid","#pandemic","#RealisedStrengths","#Service","#Gratitude","#supportothers","#challenges.","#Resilience","#Centred","#Humour","#stress","#turbulenttime.","#strengthstogether","#strengthsprofile"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Strengths Profile on August 27, 2020.

Los usuarios buscan emociones al entrar a esta red social. Sea a trav√©s de fotos o videos, tu e-commerce se tiene que concentrar en generar empat√≠a. Una manera de saber si vas por buen camino es cuantificar las interacciones con el p√∫blico.

Crear un perfil adecuado en Instagram tiene que ser uno de tus objetivos. De acuerdo al sector en el que te desempe√±es, tienes que encontrar los mejores referentes del rubro y convertirte en su seguidor.

In the span of a few months, oil went from the world's most-volatile commodity to its least but the winds of change are blowing with Hurricane Laura bearing down on the US. More below.  US durable goods orders jumped by 11% in July, beating expectations, following Tuesday's disappointing consumer confidence survey.\n\nThe winds of Hurricane Laura continue to strengthen as it crosses the warm waters of the gulf of Mexico and along with it, oil is strengthening. That led to the highest close in WTI on Tuesday since the pandemic and also left Brent just shy of the 200-dma. Laura is gaining in strength and appraoching to be a \"catastrophic\" Category 4 storm. More than half a million people were ordered to evacuate in Texas and Louisiana.\n\nMost offshore production is shut down and the storm is headed right for the heart of US refining country in Beaumont, Texas.\n\nThe problem for oil bulls is that a storm does nothing to change the overall fundamental picture. There's still 10m barrels of spare OPEC capacity and the latest mobility numbers in Europe are turning lower as the pandemic picks up.\n\nWith that, it's dangerous to see a short-term storm-inspired breakout as a the underpinning of a larger rally. At the same time, commodities everywhere have been strong as the US dollar slides and economies recover.\n\nAt times, the Canadian dollar has acted as a good leading indicator for oil and it's back to pre-pandemic levels. This is already the most-hated rally in history, why not add an oil chapter?\n\nIn terms of the broader risk trade, a big miss in August US consumer confidence did nothing to dent market confidence, especially ahead of Powell's speech on Thursday due 9:10 Eastern time (14:10 London, 17:10 Dubai).\n\n#Crude #Oil #WTI #Brent #Trading #Economy #Laura #Hurricane #Pandemic #Covid19 #Fundamental #News","NumberOfLikes":9,"Hashtags":["#Crude","#Oil","#WTI","#Brent","#Trading","#Economy","#Laura","#Hurricane","#Pandemic","#Covid19","#Fundamental","#News"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by THE FINANCIAL WAY on August 27, 2020.

Puncak musim kemarau yang terjadi pada bulan Juli dan Agustus adalah waktu yan tepat untuk menerbangkan layang-layang\n\nAngin kencang dan langit cerah menjadi daya pikat bagi para \u2018penerbang\u2019 untuk melambungkan layang-layangnya lebih tinggi. Bisa bermain layang-layang tanpa gangguan tiang listrik dan lalu-lalang kendaraan adalah sebuah kemewahan tersendiri bagi warga Jakarta, karena permainan sederhana ini membutuhkan ruang terbuka yang luas, yang sudah sangat jarang bisa ditemukan di Ibukota\n\nSejak pukul 15.00 WIB warga berkumpul dan membawa layangan andalannya masing- masing. Beberapa warga ada yang baru membeli layang-layang dan benang gelasan di Hek, sebuah toko yang khusus menjual pernak-pernik layangan di daerah Halim, Jakarta Timur. Toko Hek telah berdiri sejak tahun 1994 dan selama dua dekade lebih selalu memenuhi kebutuhan para \u2018penerbang\u2019\n\nAgar tidak terjadi bentrok, warga telah membagi lahan bermain menjadi dua. Lapangan depan digunakan untuk anak-anak kecil yang biasa menerbangkan layangan jenis sukhoi. Mereka sering kali adu ketangkasan dengan layangan sukhoi ini. Sementara para remaja dan bapak-bapak berkumpul lebih jauh di lapangan belakang. Mereka menyukai layangan jenis koang yang lebih besar, beragam bentuknya dan membutuhkan keahlian tingkat tinggi untuk menerbangkannya\n.\n.\n.\n#coronavirus #covid2019 #asia #southeastasia #jakarta #indonesia #pandemic #photojournalism #everydaycovid19 #reportagespotlight #people  #quarantine #largescalesocialrestriction #psbb #newnormal #jakarta #indonesia #layangan #layanglayang #kites #koang #sukhoi","NumberOfLikes":131,"Hashtags":["#coronavirus","#covid2019","#asia","#southeastasia","#jakarta","#indonesia","#pandemic","#photojournalism","#everydaycovid19","#reportagespotlight","#people","#quarantine","#largescalesocialrestriction","#psbb","#newnormal","#jakarta","#indonesia","#layangan","#layanglayang","#kites","#koang","#sukhoi"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1598527694,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 27 13:28:14 CEST 2020","Location":"Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"Owner":"acsi_southern_afr","CaptionText":"Parenting in this digital world?

We are likely all aware that the clinical effects of this respiratory disease are particularly severe in certain populations, including seniors, people with pre-existing respiratory and cardiac disease, and those with compromised immune systems. People with #obesity have a higher likelihood of being in each of these categories and should therefore be considered at increased risk for severe disease. This is particularly true for people with moderate to severe obesity, whose compromised physiological state and burden of complications is generally higher. In addition, for people with severe obesity, management of severe COVID-19 may also be compromised by challenges in diagnosis and treatment caused by the physical effects of their obesity.

Else, it will risk a decade of economic stagnation, a report by the McKinsey Global Institute warns.\n\nOver the decade to 2030, 60 million new workers are likely to enter the workforce as per current demographic trends, and an additional 30 million workers could move from farm work to more productive non-farm sectors.\n\nFor that to happen, India\u2019s GDP needs to grow by 8 to 8.5 per cent annually over the next decade. That is¬†double the 4.2 per cent rate of growth seen in fiscal year 2020.\n\nIf India fails to introduce measures to address the pre-pandemic trends of flat employment and slowing economic growth and does not manage the shock of the Covid crisis adequately, its economy could achieve a decadal growth of just 5 per cent and absorb only about six million new workers.\n\nThe McKinsey report finds that the manufacturing and construction sectors could achieve the fastest acceleration in sector GDP growth relative to the past. In the coming decade, manufacturing productivity has the potential to rise by about 7.5 per cent per year, contributing more than one-fifth of the incremental GDP.\n\nIndia would need to raise its competitiveness in high-potential sectors like electronics and capital goods, chemicals, textiles and apparel, auto and auto components, and pharmaceuticals and medical devices, which contributed to about 56 per cent of global trade in 2018.\n\nThe government has to introduce sector-specific policies to raise productivity in manufacturing, real estate, agriculture and food processing, retail, and healthcare.¬†India has the potential to reduce land costs by 20-25 percent and increase the supply of land available for construction. The government could also consider reviewing the various laws on the books and examine options to improve labor-market flexibility.\n\nSource: A report by Deccan Chronicle (Not edited by us)\n\n#infinedu \n#indiagdp\n#growth\n#jobs\n#pandemic\n#lostjobs","NumberOfLikes":13,"Hashtags":["#infinedu","#indiagdp","#growth","#jobs","#pandemic","#lostjobs"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by INFINEDU || EdTech in India.

So it's worth checking ingredients. \n\nYou can't take St. John's Wort with some medications, including the contraceptive pill so please thoroughly check its ok for you before trying them.

The narrative flows smoothly, giving me an insight into a life that is far removed from mine. A rag-to-riches story this is not, but it is the story of a man that lives by what he believes and is willing to face the fire for his convictions. A reader will only enjoy this book if they are on the same side of the political spectrum, albeit on varying degrees. Personally, I think that Kumar is leading a life that is worth chronicling, but I would have waited a few more years before publishing an account such as this because there is a lot that has happened and continues to happen from where the book ends. \n\n===================\nFrom Bihar to Tihar \n@kanhaiyakumar \n2016\n===================\n\n#Bookstagram #Bookloversofinstagram #IGBooks #bookish #bookblogger #instabooks #reading #bookgram #bibliophile #bookcommunity #bookstagrammer #bookstagramfeature  #bookstagramindia #bookstagramcommunity #jnu #iamantinational  #booknerd #bookbooksbooks #bookshelf #bookquotes #bookphoto #bookporn #fiction #bookshelf  #bookclub #currentlyreading #Pandemic #2020reads  #quarantinereads #pandemicreads #indianreads","NumberOfLikes":7,"Hashtags":["#Bookstagram","#Bookloversofinstagram","#IGBooks","#bookish","#bookblogger","#instabooks","#reading","#bookgram","#bibliophile","#bookcommunity","#bookstagrammer","#bookstagramfeature","#bookstagramindia","#bookstagramcommunity","#jnu","#iamantinational","#booknerd","#bookbooksbooks","#bookshelf","#bookquotes","#bookphoto","#bookporn","#fiction","#bookshelf","#bookclub","#currentlyreading","#Pandemic","#2020reads","#quarantinereads","#pandemicreads","#indianreads"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Affairs Of Ink on August 27, 2020.

We'll discuss potential opportunities by adding online elements to your business offerings such as courses and digital products, all while focusing on how these can be integrated into your existing business model and tailored to suit your personality and goals.\n\nThis has never been more important than now as we face uncertainty during the pandemic and related lockdowns.\n\nA Spark Session works on the principle that real value can be found by shifting perspective from the day-to-day of running your business and taking a broader, longer-term view, and gleaning insight from an outside perspective. Inspiration is important and so is action.

Now, that said, scientists and doctors can and are bought and paid for the exact same way politicians are, it\u2019s an incestual cycle of money and corruption.\n___\nI\u2019ve been in social discussions trying to help people understand the connections between Bill Gates and the Gates Foundation, Fauci and the NIH, Tedros and the WHO, GAVI, CEPI, the CDC and many other organizations that are involved and people respond by saying things like, \u201Cthat\u2019s crazy, those are just conspiracy theories, what does Bill Gates have to gain?\u201D \n___\nFirst of all, phrases like \u201Cconspiracy theory\u201D have been burned into your subconscious as negative, irrational and dangerous concepts just driven by the uneducated. The reason this is done is because most of these \u201Cconspiracy theories\u201D are conspiracy realities and you\u2019ve been programmed to think otherwise so as to detract as many people as possible from actually doing the reading and the research to connect those dots. By definition, to conspire is simply \u201Cto act in harmony toward a common end\u201D, it\u2019s not illogical to simply read a bit and see that in fact, Gates, Fauci, Tedros and others, have been working together for many years towards a common end. Global mandated vaccination being just one objective. \n___\nAs to what they have to gain? Incredible wealth and further control. Think of all the control they already have. They\u2019ve mandated lockdowns, the irrational wearing of masks, the closing of schools and other ludicrous rules and regulations to the entire world...the ENTIRE world! Bill Gates is the 2nd wealthiest individual in the world only surpassed by Jeff Bezos. In September 2019, as reported by Forbes, Gates was worth about $105 Billion. Today, his wealth has grown by $10 Billion dollars in well under a year and his net worth is nearly $115 Billion, and that\u2019s just what\u2019s reported. But he has nothing to gain, right? \n___\nCheckout Rational & Reason on Facebook for the full post and links to these articles and video. #insight #planned #pandemic #transferofwealth #gates #cdc #who","NumberOfLikes":1,"Hashtags":["#insight","#planned","#pandemic","#transferofwealth","#gates","#cdc","#who"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598508373,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 27 08:06:13 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"portiamayanglambam2","CaptionText":"Brave is finding a new normal #new_normal #pandemic #braveheart","NumberOfLikes":119,"Hashtags":["#new_normal","#pandemic","#braveheart"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Portia Mayanglambam on August 26, 2020.

Not only is there a sort of stigma around reaching out for financial help, but often unemployment departments have convoluted processes for determining unemployment insurance (benefits) eligibility.

Although stimulus talks continue to stall on Capitol Hill, it is important to know if YOU qualify for stimulus and unemployment payments once guidelines are set.

Nayong Kanluran sa Quezon City matapos na maka-close contact ng isang nagpositibo sa COVID-19 ang nasa isa sa 25 na pamilya na roon. \n.\nNalaman ng KAMI na isang lalaki ang nagawa pa umanong makipag-inuman sa kabila ng pagigigng positbo nito sa COVID-19 sa isinagawang rapid test sa kanya. Ayon pa sa ulat ng GMA News, isa sa mga naka-inuman pa ng lalaki ay anak ng ex-kagawad ng lugar. Habang hinihintay ng anak ng dating kagawad ang resulta ng kanyang test, ang kanyang ama naman ang nakipag-inuman at nakipagsugal pa sa ibang grupo. Kalaunan, nagpositibo ang mag-ama sa virus kaya lalong lumawig ang mga nahawa sa kanilang lugar. Aminado ang Barangay Chairperson na si Eunice Bucsit na may katigasan ng ulo mga nasasakupang residente kaya ngayon ay nangangamba silang magka-outbreak sa kanilang lugar. \n‚†Ä\n.\nHindi ito ang unang beses na nagkaroon ng tinatawag na special concern lockdown sa Quezon City. Matatandaang noong Mayo, limang barangay ang sumailalim sa nasabing uri ng lockdown dahil sa 15-30 ang positibong kaso sa Barangay Taro, Culiat, Sauyo, Batasan Hills at Tatalon ayon sa ulat ng Rappler. Sa ulat ng Manila Bulletin, iminungkahi na ni Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles na ilagay na rin ang iba pang barangay sa Quezon CIty bukod sa Brgy. Nayong Kanluran dahil sa patuloy na pagtaas ng hawahan ng COVID-19 sa lugar.

(I\u2019ve done that many times this year already\u2026)\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: this is the greatest year that we\u2019ve been alive to proclaim that God is our refuge, a very present help in time of trouble.\n\nTo remind each other that Jesus is our Savior - & our government is not.\n\nTo share with friends & acquaintances & complete strangers that we can still REJOICE in the strength & shield that is our God.\n\nTo trumpet the call to follow Jesus, trust him, obey him.\n\nTo demonstrate how worthy the Holy Spirit is to guide us into all truth.\n\nTo announce God\u2019s abundant goodness, even in the midst of suffering.\n\nWe. Are. Blessed.\n\nIn the midst of this pandemic, we are still blessed. And we have such a *perfect* opportunity to profess it. Perhaps we are here on this earth \u201Cfor such a time as this.\u201D\n\nInto the noisy chaos, let\u2019s continue to send messages of peace & hope. We will announce words of loving truth. We will infuse our interactions with joy & kindness & calls to courage.

Even if those things really suck and feel like the end of the world. With the pandemic and other countless events, 2020 has truly been a heartbreaking year for many people. I\u2019m lucky enough to have had both of my jobs and school still continue during this difficult time. I was still able to see familiar faces and create memories with others even though I wasn\u2019t near always them physically. I was able to trust myself into exploring new horizons (literally and metaphorically) while forming a deeper relationship with myself. I\u2019ve had my eyes opened to issues I never knew existed, and gained appreciation for what I have. I\u2019m grateful for my life this year and the unexpected events it has brought, and felt like this year was meant to happen the way it did. But I\u2019m aware that there are many people who may think otherwise and feel they are stuck in an unending nightmare.

We needed a win to qualify for the GF, but, despite Dyson scoring earlier,  #Poweredbyrice (PBR) was losing 2-1 deep into the 2nd half. We threw the kitchen sink at them. We could feel the momentum when Tim rattled the bar from distance. With less than 5 minutes @sonofdy & @echicken07 would press hard to steal the ball from the goalie and slot it in to get us on equal terms. 60 seconds later I would place the ball into the bottom left corner in to make it 3-2. The week after we would come from behind again from 3 nil down to win 6-3 &, with that, our 3rd & final mixed championship.\n\n It was our eighth season & 4th year together as a team & like many times before we had been tenacious & never backed down. @jflorentina\nplayed, what minutes she could, despite carrying an injury from her game just before whilst Jaysee - forever an anchor in our defense - would go on to play nearly the entire game. The boys knuckled down and showed heart. It was a hard-fought game & I was proud of PBR. But tbh it's not the comradery, the competition nor the football I'm watching for. It's not those moments I entirely miss.\n\nIt's hearing #friends cheer, talk & laugh with no fear or angst. It's hearing Thomas' voice. It's the memory that once #onceuponatime , no matter how #shit our week was, we knew that #everygivensunday that there would be 20-30 friends cheering each other on from the sidelines. And win or lose we'd be kicking back afterwards going for a feed or drink - forgetting all our troubles for a short while. That feeling in 2020 feels far & few between. It''s nice to imagine that once the #pandemic is over I can come down on a Sunday and see the crew like we used to - bickering, laughing and up to their usual antics. It's a pipedream but nice to imagine.\n\nIt's either that, or I'm romanticising something as simple as an excuse for my friends to get healthy or try and find a boyfriend\/ girlfriend ü§î","NumberOfLikes":14,"Hashtags":["#socialdistancing","#indoorsoccer","#Poweredbyrice","#friends","#onceuponatime","#shit","#everygivensunday","#pandemic"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598491061,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 27 03:17:41 CEST 2020","Location":"Brisbane City Indoor Sports"},{"Owner":"madeitjustbecause","CaptionText":"üå∏üåøüñ§His & Hers masksüñ§üåøüå∏\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n#madeitjustbecause  #hisandhers #animals #colourful #noahsark #classic #black #reusablefacemasks #cottonfacemasks #protectyourself #protectothers\n#masks #mask #covid #coronavirus #facemask #staysafe #stayhome #facemasks #quarantine #corona #handmade #socialdistancing #love #fashion #pandemic #lockdown #ppe #masksforsale #bhfyp","NumberOfLikes":19,"Hashtags":["#madeitjustbecause","#hisandhers","#animals","#colourful","#noahsark","#classic","#black","#reusablefacemasks","#cottonfacemasks","#protectyourself","#protectothers","#masks","#mask","#covid","#coronavirus","#facemask","#staysafe","#stayhome","#facemasks","#quarantine","#corona","#handmade","#socialdistancing","#love","#fashion","#pandemic","#lockdown","#ppe","#masksforsale","#bhfyp"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1598490942,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 27 03:15:42 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"azellanyata05","CaptionText":"üé≠\n.. stay safe\n#pandemic\n#maskerkain\n#dannysatriadimask","NumberOfLikes":1,"Hashtags":["#pandemic","#maskerkain","#dannysatriadimask"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by azellanyata on August 26, 2020.
