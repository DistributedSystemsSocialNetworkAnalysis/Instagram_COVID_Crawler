As August is ending, the end of summer feels surreal, partly because of the pandemic and partly because I always feel that I'm not living summer right, it's weird.\nThis quote spoke to me, as for a long time, I've been stuck in the weeds on my passion projects, often paralyzed by having to make choices and decisions on mundane details that constitute \"the world\". Here's hoping that the wish and the thing come a little closer.\n2 - I painted some bookmarks as I was playing with water colors.\n3 and 4 - Random play with water colors - I'm literally experimenting with techniques I learnt in 5th grade and it's bringing me joy. I don't quite like how these two turned out, but I'm  telling myself that it's okay to share these, it's not the end of the world.\n*\nHope you're able to find some things to take care of your emotional well-being as well.

Everyone should be tested at least every 2-4 weeks, of course more frequently to those at high risk, such as #healthcare workers & those with pre-existing conditions.

I\u2019m lucky enough to have had both of my jobs and school still continue during this difficult time. I was still able to see familiar faces and create memories with others even though I wasn\u2019t near always them physically. I was able to trust myself into exploring new horizons (literally and metaphorically) while forming a deeper relationship with myself. I\u2019ve had my eyes opened to issues I never knew existed, and gained appreciation for what I have. I\u2019m grateful for my life this year and the unexpected events it has brought, and felt like this year was meant to happen the way it did.

We needed a win to qualify for the GF, but, despite Dyson scoring earlier,  #Poweredbyrice (PBR) was losing 2-1 deep into the 2nd half. We threw the kitchen sink at them. We could feel the momentum when Tim rattled the bar from distance. With less than 5 minutes @sonofdy & @echicken07 would press hard to steal the ball from the goalie and slot it in to get us on equal terms. 60 seconds later I would place the ball into the bottom left corner in to make it 3-2. The week after we would come from behind again from 3 nil down to win 6-3 &, with that, our 3rd & final mixed championship.\n\n It was our eighth season & 4th year together as a team & like many times before we had been tenacious & never backed down. @jflorentina\nplayed, what minutes she could, despite carrying an injury from her game just before whilst Jaysee - forever an anchor in our defense - would go on to play nearly the entire game. The boys knuckled down and showed heart. It was a hard-fought game & I was proud of PBR. But tbh it's not the comradery, the competition nor the football I'm watching for. It's not those moments I entirely miss.\n\nIt's hearing #friends cheer, talk & laugh with no fear or angst. It's hearing Thomas' voice. It's the memory that once #onceuponatime , no matter how #shit our week was, we knew that #everygivensunday that there would be 20-30 friends cheering each other on from the sidelines. And win or lose we'd be kicking back afterwards going for a feed or drink - forgetting all our troubles for a short while. That feeling in 2020 feels far & few between. It''s nice to imagine that once the #pandemic is over I can come down on a Sunday and see the crew like we used to - bickering, laughing and up to their usual antics. It's a pipedream but nice to imagine.\n\nIt's either that, or I'm romanticising something as simple as an excuse for my friends to get healthy or try and find a boyfriend\/ girlfriend 🤔","NumberOfLikes":8,"Hashtags":["#socialdistancing","#indoorsoccer","#Poweredbyrice","#friends","#onceuponatime","#shit","#everygivensunday","#pandemic"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598491061,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 27 03:17:41 CEST 2020","Location":"Brisbane City Indoor Sports"},{"CaptionText":"Session 6\nSpeaker : Abbot Dr Anto Puthenpurackal \nTopic :  Pandemic - the period of stress and strain \nModerator : Sussan Wilson \n@wilsonsussan \n#kerala \n#nationalwebinar \n#abbot \n#rome \n#pandemic \n#strain \n#stress \n#27august \n#thodupuzha","NumberOfLikes":11,"Hashtags":["#kerala","#nationalwebinar","#abbot","#rome","#pandemic","#strain","#stress","#27august","#thodupuzha"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by @binocs2020 on August 26, 2020 tagging @wilsonsussan, @alazhargroupofinstitutions, @al_azhar__gram__, and @binocs2020.

The answer is more simple than we think.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nMany times the pressure we feel starts within us - in Human Design it can start from an open root center.

The only way to release the pressure, it seems, is to \"do\" more.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nI have found that choosing to \"do\" more only feeds the pressure. Instead, finding a quick moment to head out into nature is the best medicine. While I don't love getting close to the bugs and leaves, I've been nudging myself to sit on a rock or put my feet directly in the grass.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nA few quick minutes reconnecting to nature may be exactly what's needed to stop the pressure.

Y lo que te llevará a Europa, a Egipto, o donde sea, serán todas esas cosas. Pero ahora sabemos que las cosas cambiaron.\n\n\u2013Sí sé, no me lo recuerdes. La conchesumadre... Debo organizarme. Debo empezar por algo. Lo que más tengo es tiempo. Debemos inventar algo luego, que me pueda generar dinero. \n\n\u2013No tienes que inventar mucho. Sólo tienes que aprender a utilizar esas herramientas de internet. Tienes el producto. Lo que tienes que hacer es crear las condiciones para poder vender ese producto.

Over one-third of the time, there is a witnessed seizure or signs of a recent seizure close to the time of death. They are often found lying face down. No one is sure about the cause of death in SUDEP and it may differ between cases. Some researchers think that a seizure causes an irregular heart rhythm. Other research has shown that breathing difficulties following a seizure lead to death.\n\nCan SUDEP be prevented?\nUntil further answers are available, the best way to prevent SUDEP is to lower your risk by controlling seizures. Research has found that people with all types of epilepsy that experience convulsive seizures can be at risk.

In many cases, the desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the #pandemic .\" \n#Facts💯 #plandemic #wakeup","NumberOfLikes":6,"Hashtags":["#masks","#control","#fear","#conditioning","#programming","#billgates","#masksdontwork","#mask","#symptomatic","#Covid-19","#pandemic","#Facts💯","#plandemic","#wakeup"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598471577,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 26 21:52:57 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Welcome to THE BOX. \nAs Robin Williams used to say, \n\u201CWelcome to my mind\u201D\n\nArt is supposed to disturb the comfortable and comfort the disturbed.

I\u2019m worried my child could bring the coronavirus home and then pass it on to his grandparent. Should I send my kid to school?\r\n.\r\nAnswer:\r\nThere are no hard-and-fast rules for keeping your family safe in this particular situation, but the experts do have some advice to help reduce the risk.\r\n.\r\nAfter visitors were banned from long-term care homes across B.C. in March, the province announced at the end of June people could start seeing their loved ones in-person once again, with new restrictions.\r\n.\r\nStudents are set to return to class this September, also under new restrictions and protocols. In general, children are much less likely than adults to catch, spread, or have severe illness from COVID-19, according to B.C. Ministry of Health. Like everyone else, students should isolate at home if they\u2019ve come into contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient, she said.\r\n.\r\nBut families may still want to take extra precautions to keep their oldest members healthy.\r\n.\r\nTom Koch, a UBC professor of medical geography, said his advice for a family in this situation would depend on the child\u2019s age and the state of COVID-19 cases and protocols at their school, but he would probably advise the family to send the kid to school while ensuring they follow all the physical distancing, mask-wearing and other precautions.\r\n.\r\nFull story online.

There you are happily trawling through mountains of results and data, your eagle eyes alert to any dodgy result or suspicious betting pattern, when the Western and Southern Open gets underway in New York. You don\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry.\n\nSomehow we have got as far the quarter-finals, although how we have enough players left to fill the slots is anyone\u2019s guess. The mass exodus of seeds in the first couple of rounds was not so much a surprise as mind boggling.\n\nDodgy results? Where do we start? Let\u2019s see: Dominic Thiem kicked into touch by Filip Krajinovic in 61 minutes in his opening match. A couple of days ago, the Australian Open finalist won just three, measly games. How so? Was the No.2 seed ill? No. Was he injured? No. Then how did he lose so miserably? Because in his first official match since February, he was absolutely rubbish, utter pants. Not that Thiem put it quite that way (and if he had, it would have been more along the lines of: \u201Cso a Dreck\u201D and \u2013 or should that be und? \u2013 \u201Cgrottenschlecht\u201D), but that is what he meant. He was awful, Krajinovic was much, much better (and is now in the quarters) and Thiem had a lot of work to do to be ready for the start of the US Open on Monday.\n\nTo read more go to 10sBalls.com or tap the link in our bio ☝️.\n\n@cincytennis #Cincytennis #westernandsouthernopen @andymurray #AndyMurray #UK #England @serenawilliams #serenawilliams #dominicthiem #MilosRaonic #filipkrajinovic #mariasakkari @usopen #usopen @usta #usta @atptour #ATP #AtpTour @wta #WTA #tennis #tennisnews #instatennis #tennisballs #10sballs  #Tennisplayer #coronavirus #covid19 #pandemic #Nike #NikeTennis #🎾 #🎾🎾\n\nDue to the Coronavirus pandemic, the tournament was relocated to NYC to immediately precede the US Open and to be played without fans.","NumberOfLikes":7,"Hashtags":["#Cincytennis","#westernandsouthernopen","#AndyMurray","#UK","#England","#serenawilliams","#dominicthiem","#MilosRaonic","#filipkrajinovic","#mariasakkari","#usopen","#usta","#ATP","#AtpTour","#WTA","#tennis","#tennisnews","#instatennis","#tennisballs","#10sballs","#Tennisplayer","#coronavirus","#covid19","#pandemic","#Nike","#NikeTennis","#🎾","#🎾🎾"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598470578,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 26 21:36:18 CEST 2020","Location":"USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center"},{"CaptionText":"NEW IN!!\n\nFashion Face Masks now available on our website.\n\nHelp prevent the spread of germs and look good at the same time with our 2 ply fashion face mask.\n\nAvailable in 4 different designs\n\n£10\n\nFor full information on our masks please visit our website\n\nwww.madmarchhares.com\n\n#facemasks #facemask #mask #masks #staysafe #facemaskselfie #facemasktime #socialdistancing #stayhome #selfcare #pandemic #fashion\n#stayhealthy #smallbusiness #quarantinelife #facemasksforsale #facemasking #lockdown #shopsmall #face #protect #supportsmallbusiness #facemasker #supportlocal #shoplocal #fabricmask","NumberOfLikes":13,"Hashtags":["#facemasks","#facemask","#mask","#masks","#staysafe","#facemaskselfie","#facemasktime","#socialdistancing","#stayhome","#selfcare","#pandemic","#fashion","#stayhealthy","#smallbusiness","#quarantinelife","#facemasksforsale","#facemasking","#lockdown","#shopsmall","#face","#protect","#supportsmallbusiness","#facemasker","#supportlocal","#shoplocal","#fabricmask"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Mad March Hares- Home Decor on August 26, 2020.

Do not allow the iron to touch your elastic while pressing them. After about 4 uses, your mask should fit very comfortably.

I call it my Pandemic Containment Unit , the idea behind it is an old military computer used by the medical \/ bio warfare units to log the containment of the population after an outbreak \/  attack. Found in the depths of an old military store and somehow founds its way onto the open market. \nBased losely around @back7.co cyberdeck which inspired me. It runs from a raspberry pi 4 with a 10 inch screen. The USB 3.0 ports are brought to the front and the ethernet to allow access. All 40 gpio are also brought out to allow access (i intend to use it to play with  the pi and its gpio ) I have fitted a mechanical keyboard and wired mouse. Powered from 240v or 120v via the iec connector , but with a 12vdc input on the front panel. Everything I have built from scratch. The box came first and then the chassis that the whole unit sits in. I've learnt so much doing this and have enjoyed the challenge.\n#lazydogwoodshed #cyberdeck #lazydogwoodmaker #lazydog_outdoors #dieselpunk #cyberpunk #pandemic #mechanicalkeyboard #raspberrypi #raspberrypi4 #raspberrypiprojects #back7.co @back7.co","NumberOfLikes":42,"Hashtags":["#lazydogwoodshed","#cyberdeck","#lazydogwoodmaker","#lazydog_outdoors","#dieselpunk","#cyberpunk","#pandemic","#mechanicalkeyboard","#raspberrypi","#raspberrypi4","#raspberrypiprojects","#back7.co"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":8,"Timestamp":1598467927,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 26 20:52:07 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Checkout this hot & latest Kurtis & Kurtas\nWomen's Floral Printed Rayon Kurti\nOnly at rs -

It threatens everyone, and we all must cooperate to lower the chance that the coronavirus harms any one individual. Among other things, that means keeping safe social distances and wearing masks. But many people choose not to do these things, making spread of infection more likely.\u201C\n\n\u201CTo me, it seems the problem of coronavirus defectors could be solved by moral enhancement: like receiving a vaccine to beef up your immune system, people could take a substance to boost their cooperative, pro-social behavior,\u201D Crutchfield says, acknowledging that the idea is a \u201Cfar-out proposal that\u2019s bound to be controversial.\u201D\n\nNationalFile report: The bioethics professor goes on to bemoan the gall of citizens who refuse to comply with mask mandates, and recommends \u201Cmoral enhancement,\u201D which he describes as \u201Cthe use of substances to make you more moral.\u201D\n\n\u201CThen, perhaps, the people who choose to go maskless or flout social distancing guidelines would better understand that everyone, including them, is better off when they contribute, and rationalize that the best thing to do is cooperate,\u201D Crutchfield argues, adding that the main drawbacks to moral enhancement are that \u201Cthe science isn\u2019t developed enough,\u201D and that people may refuse to take the so-called moral enhancement pills.\n\n\"IT'S ALWAYS THESE NERD LOOKING MUTHAFUCKAS WHO THINK OF SHIT LIKE THIS LOL.

WHEN TRUTH DIES, DEMOCRACY DIES!!\n.\nRepost from @washingtonpost\n\u2022\nFollow ➡️ @coveringpotus: Faced with a pandemic that has killed more than 175,000 Americans, President Trump used glitzy video and misleading testimonials to spin a tale of heroism and resolve far removed from the grim reality of a country in the throes of an uncontrolled public health crisis. One campaign-style video that aired during the convention hailed Trump as the \u201Cone leader\u201D who stood up to the virus while quoting Democratic figures who played down the severity of the virus in its early stages. It\u2019s a revisionist version of recent history belied by hours of videotape in which the president minimized the threat of the virus for months, falsely predicted that it would \u201Cdisappear\u201D with warmer weather, promoted several unproven miracle cures, pushed states to reopen before meeting federal government benchmarks, equivocated on mask-wearing, defied social distancing guidelines and repeatedly told Americans that everything was under control. While Trump has previously touted his coronavirus response with misleading videos, charts and quotes during news briefings and in campaign ads, the Republican National Convention gives him a platform unique in its scope and reach. Over the course of four nights, the GOP will have 10 hours of prime time coverage, with cable and broadcast networks airing large chunks of the program uninterrupted. It is perhaps Trump\u2019s last best chance to present an unfiltered affirmative case for a second term in a race in which a majority of voters disapprove of his handling of a pandemic that has battered the economy and upended Americans\u2019 lives.

The pace of killings is on track to surpass 1,000 this year, with nearly 3 people shot dead by the police every day.\n\nThe latest incident to produce an eruption of angry protests is the attempted murder of Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old African American father of six, shot seven times in the back by a police officer in Kenosha, Wisconsin.

This event has an out-and-out fascist character. It is putting on display the most reactionary forces in American life: racists, anti-Semites, rabid anticommunists and militarists.\n\nSuch is the rotten character of the official political system that the dregs of humanity are accorded hours of prime time television and treated seriously as a legitimate part of public life. These forces have a very real prospect of consolidating their position at the head of the most powerful imperialist state on the planet.\n\nDiatribes against socialism and open appeals to racism and xenophobia are vomited across the airwaves with little or no opposition from within the media establishment. On the contrary, one television network, Fox, is devoted entirely to the propagation of such views, while the others offer little more than half-hearted corrections, as though a four-day fascist propaganda show requires only a bit of fact-checking.\n\nThe opening night of the convention confirms the danger against which the WSWS and the Socialist Equality Party have consistently warned: Donald Trump and the Republican Party are seeking to establish an authoritarian, personalist movement, an American form of fascism, which would smash opponents through the use of brute force.\n\nGo to WSWS.org to read more.

Already she had seen more life than many people twice her age. At 17 she had graduated and taken nurse training. The war was on and the US of A newly in it. The boys were going \u201Cover there\u201D and Arianna with them. She served at a battalion hospital for several months, witness to more death and heart-wrenching suffering than she could have imagined possible while growing up in rural Minnesota. Then, the first wave of the misnamed Spanish Flu hit. She fell victim while tending the ill soldiers and it nearly killed her. She was shipped to Boston after she recovered and stationed there working with newly arriving amputees. When the second wave struck America in the fall of 1918 her mother insisted she come home. Even there, in their little community, the deadly disease was stealing the lives of young, old, and otherwise healthy people in their twenties and thirties. Young Reverend Olsen died a week after the heartbreak of laying his little son Simon to rest. All that summer Arianna watched her sisters and helped on the farm. They stayed close and had no visitors... and no suitors. Dances were forbidden and dating not allowed. \n#photostory #photostories #photofiction #summertime #summer #vintagephoto #vintagephotos #pandemic #covid_19 #spanishflu #wwi #nursing #warnurse","NumberOfLikes":14,"Hashtags":["#flashfiction","#photostory","#photostories","#photofiction","#summertime","#summer","#vintagephoto","#vintagephotos","#pandemic","#covid_19","#spanishflu","#wwi","#nursing","#warnurse"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Theo on August 26, 2020.

Until recently, most countries denied voting rights to half of their population: aka WOMEN. \n\nTo claim their voice, women began agitating for the right to vote in the early 19th century. In the US, decisions about who could vote were left up to the states. The 19th amendment, ratified in 1920, ensures voting rights for everyone regardless their GENDER. \n\nToday, Women\u2019s Equality Day celebrates the achievements of women\u2019s rights activists and reminds us of the unique daily struggles that women face. \n\nSo with that being said, USE YOUR VOICE IN 2020 AND VOTE or don\u2019t complain. KNOW YOUR RIGHTS AS A CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA because you\u2019ll never know when you need to quote them for justice👏🏼💪🏻","NumberOfLikes":170,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by 𝐑𝐀𝐂𝐇𝐄𝐋 𝐄𝐋𝐀𝐌 on August 26, 2020.

Drake, co-developer of the supported employment model Individual Placement and Support (IPS), before COVID-19 hit, with absolutely no idea what was in store for us. A global pandemic that, for many people, has impacted day-to-day life. In April, unemployment in the U.S. spiked to 14.7%. It has since decreased by 4.5% but is still far higher than before. Thanks to federal and state support and innovative programs, mental health pivoted quickly to adapt to physical distance regulations and shed the last remaining hurdles to telehealth. During the pandemic, IPS programs also rapidly shifted to provide supported employment services remotely by phone, video chat, email, and text message. Dr. Drake shared with us in an email that people with serious mental illness and other disabilities are highly vulnerable to the pandemic and associated mandates, pointing out that \u201Ctheir safety and economic security should be high on our list of priorities.\u201D IPS specialists, he notes, are working diligently to help. In the below article, Dr. Drake explains how the IPS model developed and why it works.
