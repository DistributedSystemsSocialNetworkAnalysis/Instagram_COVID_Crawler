The energy we take out with us, generally speaking, transfers to each other and we go out with every intention of making our happier selves... happier. That's what bars are for right? \n\nWhat is the presumed course of action, however, when we are sad? Largely we sit alone and feel alone. \n\nPhysics cheats us in to making time fly by when we're happy, yet it feels like wading through treacle when we're sad. It's a cruel universal truth.\n\nI begin to wonder. Is it an unshakeable truth that we are alone when we're sad? Yes, most of us have at least one person we can share are darkest selves with. But even if we do, we often feel unable to share certain aspects of ourselves with them.  And some of us are just alone.\n\nWe predominantly rely on a crumbling mental health system that heavily relies on medication or a referal to a generic therapy service that you have to wait often weeks if not months to access. \n\nWe don't want to go 'out' when we're sad. Or perhaps, if we look closer, we don't want to be surrounded by happy people when we're sad. \n\nWe are presented by happiness on social media and in social spheres.  It's a conspiracy but I think there's an epidemic of shame and denial that sadness exists at all. \n\nLet's get dystopian. We have sex clubs. Shooting clubs. Gin bars. Gay bars.\n\nLet's say bars did exist in the future or another world that specialised and catered for... the sad. Where we could go in unashamed and be there for a stranger. For eachother. I often wonder if the most qualified person to help a sad person, is a sad person.\n\nSo...

Whether that means being forced out of ones line of work due to the pandemic, or the quarantine igniting a newfound passion in elsewhere, 2020 has reminded us that it\u2019s important to stay \u2018forever employable\u2019.\n¬†\nExecutive coach Jeff Gothelf says the key to embodying this ideal can be done by becoming a master in one domain and letting opportunities find you, with the help of the following practices:\n¬†\n\u2022 Be open to constantly learning \u2013 through blogs, podcasts, events and more\n\u2022 There is always room for improvement \u2013 look for ways to better yourself, personally and professionally\n\u2022 Embrace entrepreneurialism \u2013 put your ideas out there and be ready to make a transition if necessary\n\u2022 Develop killer self-confidence and be open to reinvent your professional self to some degree\n¬†\nAll of these ideas lend themselves to remaining a prime candidate for the entirety of your career! Recruiters, what advice would you offer to candidates looking to make a transition and remain \u2018forever employable\u2019?\n\n#employable #foreveremployable #reinventyourself #newcareer #careerchange #careertransition #newjob #entrepreneur #executivecoaching #covid19 #coronavirus #newnormal #newopportunities #selfconfidence #roomforimprovement #quarantine #pandemic #change #opportunity #digitalmarketing #digitalmarketer #toptalent #recruitech #hiring #jobs #recruiting #staffing #staffingandrecruiting #marketing #marketingagency","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#employable","#foreveremployable","#reinventyourself","#newcareer","#careerchange","#careertransition","#newjob","#entrepreneur","#executivecoaching","#covid19","#coronavirus","#newnormal","#newopportunities","#selfconfidence","#roomforimprovement","#quarantine","#pandemic","#change","#opportunity","#digitalmarketing","#digitalmarketer","#toptalent","#recruitech","#hiring","#jobs","#recruiting","#staffing","#staffingandrecruiting","#marketing","#marketingagency"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598473761,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 26 22:29:21 CEST 2020","Location":"TopTalent Communications"},{"CaptionText":"The way things are going it looks like me holding out is just fine.

You can also also visit alz.org\/RollaWalk for details and more information on the Walk to End Alzheimer\u2019s.

Let me know: Would you add this book to your list? \n2. If you read it: What\u2019s your rating? What are your thoughts? Would you recommend it?\n\nRating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èüí´\/5 \n\nA VERY Short @goodreads Summary:\n\nEducated¬†is an account of the struggle for self-invention. It is a tale of fierce family loyalty and of the grief that comes with severing the closest of ties. With the acute insight that distinguishes all great writers, Westover has crafted a universal coming-of-age story that gets to the heart of what an education is and what it offers: the perspective to see one's life through new eyes and the will to change it.\n\nTHE READ AFTER THE READ: \n\nEmotional AF: It\u2019s hard to rate a memoir because you can\u2019t just rate someone else\u2019s life. At first, it was hard for me to read how I normally do because there\u2019s alot to unpack here. It\u2019s \u201Cemotional\u201D because it made me very angry to read what Tara Westover had to go through with her abusive family growing up. Had me cursing EVERYüëèüèΩBODYüëèüèΩANDüëèüèΩTHEIRüëèüèΩMAMAüëèüèΩOUTüëèüèΩ! \n\nThought-provoking AF: Some people take having the opportunity of an education for granted. Sad, but it\u2019s more common than not. It really made me realize how blessed I was to be able to continue my education because a lot of people don\u2019t have the luxury or the means to do the same. It also shared the lesson that I\u2019ve lived and known every day of my life: not everybody is meant to come along with you during your journey of personal development, especially if they\u2019re toxic. My Scorpio self\u2019s cutoff game is LETHAL! If I feel like someone is shady, doesn\u2019t have my best interest at heart or doesn\u2019t want to see me fulfill my dreams, and are stunting my growth\u2026 no matter who you are, ‚úÇÔ∏è‚úåüèΩ\n\nInspirational AF: This story has also made me think about how, as individuals, we have to make our own choices for ourselves and our future. No matter our circumstances or the examples around us, we have the ability to break generational and community curses by walking to the beat of our own drum and wanting better for ourselves. No matter how outlandish it may sound to others, believe in yourself and your dream, have faith, and make that move!","NumberOfLikes":141,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Jaz Imaniüåôüåª on August 26, 2020 tagging @randomhouse.

That\u2019s a problem, especially in the middle of a global pandemic.\n\nI have been advocating for increasing the number of school nurses for years.

Will things actually be how it was? Will there be a sense of fear in us everytime we move out ? What went wrong that we have to see this day? Maybe this was meant to happen or Maybe not!\n\nA wise will look for opportunities even in this situation. And only few people take advantage of the opportunity and go ahead. When we have all the time with us, why don't we make the most of it. They say empty mind is the devil's brain. Indeed it is and we cannot deny that, with that being said it doesn't mean¬†occupied mind cannot be interrupted by the devil's, but then we should know how to deal with it. This is the time to learn things which we failed to learn when life was normal. This lockdown is nothing less then adding a misery to the human life but with time management we can take the most from this period. Being productive by always keeping our mind occupied can make us learn things which we didn't even learn when we use to focus. Sometimes we just need a calm and compose mind to make things work.

I'd spent the last three years saving money and planning a several-month trip in Australia on a WHV.\n\nAs you can guess, that plan went out the window fast. One week quarantining in Perth and a ridiculously expensive flight later and I was back home in the UK with no job or plan. The next few months were a rocky journey.\n\nNow, however, I have my blog up and running with MULTIPLE posts and I'm working part-time in a bakery. I'm living in my family home (which I'm now extremely tired of üòÇ) and I'm starting to figure out what my next move is since COVID-19 is clearly not going away for a long while.\n\nWhile I expect to be stuck in my family home and working in the bakery until at least April 2021, I've decided on two UK trips and a contingency plan if Australia doesn't open up by the first half of 2021.\n\nIn October this year, I'll be spending a long weekend in the Yorkshire Dales and in March 2021, I'll be doing a two week road trip in Scotland. Get ready for some great UK travel advice and itineraries!\n\nOnce April hits, my friend and I will be deciding whether or not to use our savings for a different dream or if we'll be able to go to Australia as originally planned. Thankfully, we're both on the same page and accept that we may have to do something else and save up money for Australia another time. If this happens, I'll be experimenting with the idea of vanlife and may even dive straight in.\n\nEither way, expect great and exciting things in 2021! I know I will. \n\nJust remember, it's okay to alter your plans to make room for something new in light of the pandemic. I know I don't want to settle down so if I can't travel internationally, I'll be moving onto vanlife and begin exploring this beautiful country I call home.","NumberOfLikes":8,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by üåçThe Runaway Grad in Glasgow Botanic Gardens.

In video footage of the melee, a white vigilante appears on video brazenly walking down the street with his long gun. Reports say he had already shot someone in the stomach a few blocks away and was reportedly being chased by protesters trying to subdue him.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nThe gunman is seen on video falling to the ground, and that is when he fires his gun, striking and killing two people.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nAfterwards, police who likely heard the gunshots swarmed the area in patrol cars and fortified vehicles, from the video we see the gunman\u2014with his gun still clearly visible around his chest, put his hands in the air. Police vehicles all pass him, as the crowd screams, he is the shooter.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nAs a result, the shooter was able to escape and is still on the loose.

But it's not just rainforests being destroyed by the global appetite for meat. Neighboring Argentina is \"burning out of control\" as a result of cattle ranchers burning grasslands to create new pasture. Yet \"grass-fed\" meat continues to be greenwashed, with groups like the Carne Collective marketing pastured Argentinian beef to U.S. consumers under the guise of it being #regenerative & \"eco-friendly.\"\n\nMeanwhile in the U.S., beef production is quietly devastating old growth forests in the West. As reported in the L.A. Times: \u201CThe federal government is overseeing a program of massive deforestation on Western public lands. Some 7.4 million acres of pinyon-juniper forest in the care of the Bureau of Land Management in Nevada, Utah and southern Idaho are targeted for destruction over the next several years\u2026 to satisfy the demands of the cattle industry for grazing forage on public lands.\u201D \n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nLike climate change and the current pandemic, deforestation is one of several global crises being driven by human demand for animal flesh. Deforestation of tropical forests in turn drastically increases the likelihood of zoonotic disease spillover.

What can possibly be bad about realizing that you are actually a very cool human being?\n\nMany of us keep feeding the voices that eat our self confidence, I personally avoid going to castings, postpone writing cool stories, offering workshops and posting in this account.

So much of our headspace is working out details that either have already happened or could possibly take place. Meanwhile life is happening in the now. \n\n\u2022\nGod is so powerful he resides in all three spaces. The past, the future, and the present. However, it\u2019s fascinating to recall the moment in Genesis Chapter 2 when we read: \u201COn the seventh day God completed the work he had been doing; he rested on the seventh day from all the work he had undertaken.\u201D Why did God rest? He\u2019s God. \n\n\u2022\nThere is peace found in receiving. Whether it is stopping to take in the simplicity of life or in simple joys like laughter. There is also a peace that can only be found in stillness. You have to stop in order to receive it. You have to rest. \n\n\u2022\nThis forced pause on the world has been anything but peaceful. As a whole we have seen so much unrest and pain surface to a level we can no longer deny. However, in our own private lives so many of us have found a simplicity we didn\u2019t know we needed. So many families have gotten stronger. So many marriages have become more fortified. Is this because we are all faced with only being promised with the current now? \n\n\u2022\nThe past we grieved we now know and accept no longer exists. And the future we grieved we now know and accept might never be what we had imagined. But the present is now where we know to focus and accept. This new everyday is starting to make sense.

The immune system is the body\u2019s #defence against the risk of infections, disease and potentially deadly #pathogens.\n.\n What we all want to know right now is how to strengthen it so that we can decrease the risk of infection and, if we do get infected, decrease the severity of any virus. Read on to find out how\u2026 \n.\nWhat is the immune system?\nThe immune system is the body\u2019s police force, keeping unwanted elements in check. It works around the clock every day on three fronts:\n.\n‚ù§Ô∏èThe first line of defence involves barring entry to any invaders by physical and chemical barriers, such as those provided by the skin, mucous membranes and stomach acids.\n‚ù§Ô∏èIf the first barrier is breached, the second line of defence is provided by non-specific responses, such as fever or inflammation.\n‚ù§Ô∏èThe third line of defence is precisely targeted against specific pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria. It is mounted by white blood cells that detect, identify and destroy the pathogens.\n.\nSo, how can we support this system so that it is as strong as possible? Here are the golden rules for a strong immune system:\n.\n1.\tGet the right nutrients\n2.\tRespect your circadian rhythm\n3.\tBalance your stress levels\n4.\tBe moderate \u2013 in alcohol consumption, weight and exercise\n.\nInterested?
