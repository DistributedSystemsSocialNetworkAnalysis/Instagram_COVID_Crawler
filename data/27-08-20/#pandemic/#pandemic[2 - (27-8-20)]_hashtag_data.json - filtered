[{"CaptionText":"We live in a time of confusion and distress because of this pandemic.\n\nSome of us can't even see our own family! Some are not allowed to attend regular church services; and we have covered our faces because of a fear of a disease in which there is at least a 90% recovery rate. There is no hope in the world because everyone is so afraid of death and they have no hope for after death. \"And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.\" James 5:15.\n\n\"Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.\" Isaiah 41:10. There is no need for a Christian to be afraid or dismayed. \"We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed; Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body. For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh. So then death worketh in us, but life in you. We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak; Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you.\" 2 Corinthians 4:8\u202D-\u202C14. \n\nAs Christians, we have the hope of the Lord Jesus Christ in us and therefore we need not fear death. Christ is on the side of His chosen people.\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*#wordsofwisdom #encouragement #motivation #biblicalencouragement #positivity #dailybread #Godisgreat #christian #God #Jesus #bible #pandemic #death #hope #lifeinJesus #life #fashion #classyclothing #clothing #hopewithhannah","NumberOfLikes":33,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Hannah Span in Spokane, Washington with @nordstrom, @scottsullivan23, and @walmartfashion.

From the beginning, I\u2019ve definitely not been keen on the idea of kids going back to school in a non-remote environment during a global pandemic. This all started months ago when limited students went back; my anxiety was further triggered with my mother back in school teaching from May\/June and as a teacher, not feeling safe at all, but I never saw it as good or even viable. \nHere we\u2019ve fast forwarded to August 2020, midway to end, and schools are looking to resume - some measures have been put in place, but they\u2019re being taught relatively normally... should that be right? I don\u2019t agree that it should. \n-\nToday I want to focus on something very specific: Scottish education leading us in to \u2018normal\u2019 again. The Scottish schools have just gone back for the autumn term as per every year, and... it\u2019s not going so well. My hometown, Paisley, is one small example of a much wider problem. \n-\nSCOTLAND: \nIf you\u2019ve been following the UK based statistics, you\u2019ll have observed a drastic difference between English and Scottish case numbers; Scotland have consistently dealt with this virus much more so safely and taken preventative action, saving hundreds of lives. England, on the other hand, would much rather focus on the economy like there\u2019s no threat. \n-\nPAISLEY: \nPaisley is a small town just West of Glasgow. The coronavirus spread in the town was controlled and minimal, yet a pupil from a FOURTH school has tested positive for coronavirus. Four schools with a case in a matter of days (in all of which the pupil has interacted with others). This is news barely spreading further from Paisley because the media does not want it to - it would only show the government\u2019s failures. This news should be shared beyond and I\u2019m ashamed to have only known about it as a result of my family. \n-\nI want to emphasise this: English schools are due to return in a matter of weeks. They shouldn\u2019t be. \n-\nThis is the story of a small town but representative of so much more, including a huge rise in Scottish cases generally. The town *was* doing well, but going back to school has undoubtedly jeopardised.","NumberOfLikes":16,"AccessibilityCaption":"The image shows a flat lay of 3 different pieces of paper in which study notes have been written on them.

She was spunky and spri. She had a zeal for life and appreciation that only those who just beat cancer could have. We talked about her son and getting back to work. Boy would her students be surprised by her new haircut. We talked about God and the blessing of slowing down. She told me of the ups and downs of chemo and radiation but how God had been there through it all. \u2063\n\u2063\nI always looked forward to our appointments. On the day of our appointment I did the normal scan over the recent medical history but found that the cancer was back and was very aggressive. I could no longer treat her for lymphedema, I prayed for her and wanted so badly to tell her it would be ok. I mean, God can do anything! \u2063\n\u2063\nAs I drove home that day I begged God to heal her. I pleaded on her behalf. With everything in me I wanted God to touch her and for the cancer to disappear. In the midst of my plea\u2019s, this thought came to mind \u201Cyou don't have to defend God\u201D. \u2063\n\u2063\nMy desperation turned from the cry of my heart to a single tear. This I know, God can do anything and He hears every prayer. He knows and sees far more than I do and I need to trust Him even when it isn't the outcome I would like. Trust Him that His way is best. That this is the best outcome and that it is grace this side of heaven. \u2063\n\u2063\n\u201CFor my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, declares the Lord. \u201CAs the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.\u201D Isaiah 55:8-9\u2063\n\u2063\n#christianot #occupationaltherapist #occupationaltherapystudent #physicaltherapist #nurse #doctor #respiratorytherapist #travelot #travelpt #speechtherapist #trustGod #coronavirus #covid19 #pandemic #bethelight #praiseinthepandemic #faith #prayer #Thanksgiving #Jesusandmedicine  #Prayerandmedicine\u2063","NumberOfLikes":34,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The Christian OT on August 26, 2020.

This restaurant was one of the finest in the world. Not only was it a restaurant, it contained a mini farm for small animals to ensure the freshest product, a workshop to repurpose wine bottles for art and other uses that reduce waste and contribute to sustainability. They also had a flavor lab to experiment new ingredients\/recipes. The wine cellar was massive with thousands of bottles of wine. The dining room was equipped to manipulate luz y sombra (light and shadow) by using black and white color schemes for a clean cut design. The middle of the restaurant had some and enclosed triangle with some trees through allowing more natural light and for you to see the immense other side of the restaurant. Inside the dining room it was more relaxing than the beach. The guest hospitality was surreal. That\u2019s why they sell out for the years worth of reservations in less than a day.

I still remember the first day I  had to leave my newborn. The intense mix of emotions I felt the sadness, the worry the fear that I was letting my child down was intense. I didn't realize till later on as this feeling occurred more regularly, that this was an actual entity. \u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nAs the world grapples with a pandemic and our children are navigating in these unusual times, the anxiety for parents is palpable. Parents are being challenged like never before to make difficult decisions for their children. Struggling between deciding what is the better choice for their child's physical and mental health. \u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nThere is no handbook for this and parents are looking for guidance.  The struggle of feeling overwhelmed about making the right decision and how it may impact your child down the road is very real.\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nParenting is very personal. Parenting during a pandemic has proven to break all the rules as we have thrown the handbook out the window. \u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nTo best deal with mothers(parents)guilt \u2063\u2063\nWe have to put the focus back on personal. What is best for your family. Not what is best for someone else's  family. \u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nIf you start comparing yourself or your children with everyone else, you will be pulled down onto the heaviness of this guilt. \u2063\n\u2063\nWe set unrealistic expectations of ourselves and get overwhelmed when we feel like we are unable to meet them. \u2063\n\u2063\nThere is no wrong or right way. There is just YOUR way. YOU do YOU and your kids & family will love you for all the right reasons. \n\n#motherhood #mommy #parenting #mothersguilt #children #success #balance #raisingkids #family #kids #pandemic #mommyguilt #mommying #docmommy #mommydoc #docsofinsta #docsofinstagram #momsofinstagram","NumberOfLikes":212,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Dr. Uzma Syed on August 26, 2020 tagging @halalparenting, and @mommyingwhilemuslimpodcast.

They\u2019ve been filled with challenges, introspection, constant learning, and many moments that have humbled me. However, there has also been so much joy, personal fulfillment, and pride at what I\u2019m blessed to do every day, even when it\u2019s hard. I\u2019ve been present for so many people\u2019s darkest and scariest days, and most of them couldn\u2019t pick me out of a lineup. It\u2019s wild to think about.\n\nThis year, working in healthcare has been a struggle that I still haven\u2019t quite been able to put into words. I try to keep my patients and coworkers at the front of my mind, but find that I\u2019ve been frustrated beyond belief by a select public narrative that seeks to call us heroes while simultaneously invalidating our experiences and broad knowledge. The pandemic has been hard on all of us, but never in my 10 years of nursing have I spoken with so many colleagues that feel burnt out and unappreciated. A public that refuses to believe in science and public health is a public that looks at the wonderful people I work with daily and tells them that their sacrifice and years of service trying to improve lives doesn\u2019t matter. These people aren\u2019t big corporations out to control you - they\u2019re regular people like me and my friends, trying our best and hardest to make the world a better place, despite it being turned upside down. We\u2019re carrying a lot with us at the moment.\n\nMy wish for year four of anesthesia practice is a better balance for myself and a return to the passion of what I\u2019d like to fight for: de-stigmatizing mental health services for medical providers, fighting racism in medicine, fighting injustice in healthcare, drowning out the voices around and continuing to learn as much as possible.

It can be uncomfortable and debilitating. It can result from injury, activity and some medical conditions. Back pain can affect people of any age, for different reasons. As people get older, the¬†chances of developing¬†lower back pain increases, due to factors such as previous occupation and degenerative disk disease. Lower back pain may be linked to the bony lumbar spine, discs between the vertebrae, ligaments around the spine and discs, spinal cord and nerves, lower back muscles, abdominal and pelvic internal organs, and the skin around the lumbar area. While usual causes maybe muscle spasm of the area, others can include disk extrusion and rarely internal organ damage.\n.\n#back #pain #lumbar #meme #doctor #basketball #lebronjames #kingjames #23 #nba #pandemic #quarantine #funny #medical #doctor #followme #likeforlike #enjoy #laugh #lumbarspine","NumberOfLikes":5,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ùóßùóõùóò ùó†ùó¢ùóóùóòùó•ùó° ùó©ùóîùóúùóóùó¨ùóîùó° in Lumbar Spine with @kingjames, @nba, @nbaindia, @dr_tushar_mehta, @medinaz_academy, @basketball, @mnemonicsmed, @strongerlumbar, @the_boneteacher, @crystalmedicallife, @orthopaedicsplus, @that.aspiring.orthopod, @medicaltalks_with_labi, and @doctor_tales.

My 6 takeaways from an article by @adamgrant in the @theeconomist (link in bio) on how Covid-19 could change the way we work. \u2060\n\u2060\n1, We will be more grateful for the work we have. Gratefulness -> happiness. Therefore people would be happier at work.\u2060\nCounterpoint: Bosses may take advantage of people who value their work. Ever heard of \"passion tax\"?\u2060\n\u2060\n2, \"People-first\" approach wins in the long term. People notice when companies care, they will stay more loyal after the crisis.\u2060\n\u2060\n3, Ethical leadership will prevail. We could end up with Japanese model of protecting jobs or Scandinavian model of providing a safety- net for those who lose their jobs.\u2060\n\u2060\n4, We will see a renaissance of guilds: groups that share occupational skills. Could be employee-owned or structured as partnerships with job security and benefits.\u2060\n\u2060\n5, Trust - we will see polarization of trust. Either it is complete trust or complete distrust. The middle way is unlikely.\u2060\n\u2060\n6, Best for the last - Would we see a change in working hours? Perhaps we would finally align working hours with school hours. What would be the implications on traffic patterns? Grant advocates less hours in general. Task ahead would be to make the fewer hours count.\u2060","NumberOfLikes":7,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Surya Ramkumar on August 26, 2020 tagging @adamgrant.

Science does not lie.\u201D\u2063\n\u2063\nThe pharmacist further explained: \u201COn March 20, 2020, during a press briefing, I said I was going through literature and I found (out) that chloroquine and remdesivir killed COVID-19 in vitro \u2013 that is in the laboratory. In early March, there was a publication where 100 patients were treated with chloroquine in 10 hospitals across Chinese cities. I made a statement that chloroquine is only for clinical trial treatment. There has to be a level of confidence that depends on the number of subjects and results.\u201D\u2063\n\u2063\nShe went on: \u201CWe did not know that the disease has four stages that include pre-exposure, early-stage, severe stage, and post-infection. At what stage that chloroquine will be more effective, we did not know at that time.\u2063\n\u2063\n\u201CWe are now understanding that it is not one drug that can be effective for COVID-19. It depends on the phase of the disease. We started working with Lagos State on a clinical trial for chloroquine. We are getting to know that it is working.\u2063\n\u2063\n#feed #celebfeed \n\u2063\n#NAFDAC #Chloroquine #COVID19 #Coronavirus #Pandemic #Remdesivir #ClinicalTreatment #Treatment #Health #Nigeria","NumberOfLikes":1,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598442313,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 26 13:45:13 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Trash day! #hottrash #pandemic #lololololololololololololololololololololololololol","NumberOfLikes":2,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Ryann on August 26, 2020.

There have been¬†anecdotal reports of reinfections¬†in the US, but this time researchers have clearer evidence: They¬†determined¬†the genetic signature of the second infection did not match that of the first. There\u2019s still a lot not known about the case. The researchers, who are medical scientists from the University of Hong Kong, announced their finding in a¬†press release. (They say a paper in the journal¬†Clinical Infectious Diseases¬†is forthcoming; a few pages of the report¬†are circulating on Twitter.) When the report is finally published, there\u2019s sure to be more scrutiny from the scientific community. On this topic of reinfection, we can be reassured: The report, if corroborated, is in line with what immunity¬†experts have been telling us is possible¬†with this virus. The most important detail: The man was not symptomatic during his second infection, which shows that his immune system¬†did¬†respond to the virus. According to the Hong Kong researchers, the first time the patient got sick, he felt ill: He had a cough, a sore throat, fever, and headache, and had to be hospitalized. The second time the patient tested positive for the virus \u2014 four and a half months later \u2014 after being screened at the airport, he felt no symptoms at all. The immune system is profoundly complicated, and \u201Cimmunity\u201D can mean many different things. A lot of this nuance gets lost in headlines about immunity.

I have a toddler and a newborn, who I breastfeed. On a couple of recent trips into town I have struggled to find toilets for my toddler to use and places to breastfeed. \n\nIn #Southport, you have to pay to use public toilets and as very few places take cash now, I rarely have cash on me. The Atkinson, has closed their toilets and the only ones that can be used are in Marks and Spencer. (thank you @marksandspencer for not closing your toilets.) This has meant my toddler having accidents while we\u2019re dashing to find a loo. You can\u2019t just walk into a cafe or pub anymore and there are too few public toilets in Southport as it is. Of course, fewer toilets also mean the options for baby changing are also limited. Yet another deterrent to going into town. \nAs a #breastfeeding mama, I am finding it difficult to find places to breastfeed. @theatkinsonsouthport seems to have removed all their seats. On a visit to the library with my toddler and baby, the latter wanted feeding, I looked around and realized there was nowhere to sit and breastfeed. I then had to drag the toddler out (kicking and screaming). Now with two screaming kids I looked around frantically to find somewhere to sit and feed her. As it was dry I found a bench and fed her. \nYes, there are cafes, but some you have to book and as there is now less capacity there may not be a table available. Also why should I have to buy something just to have a place to breastfeed my infant.\nTo me this has made the town centre feel like an unwelcoming place and a stressful option, one I am mostly likely to avoid in future.\nWhile I understand the reasons behind why there are fewer facilities. @sefton_council and @southportbid might want to look at how the \u2018new normal\u2019 makes life more difficult for parents of young children and think of ways to help encourage them to come into town.","NumberOfLikes":11,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598440157,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 26 13:09:17 CEST 2020","Location":"Southport"},{"CaptionText":"The Days have been such a Blur this month is almost over and we are about to enter #LDW2020 Labor Day Weekend is creeping up on us Quicker than it did last year #dogdaysofsummer What are the Options for this LDW?

Still we have successfully survived the #quarantine and became even more productive working from home, which makes me extremely proud.\n\nThe annual #beach party though had to happen. Last weekend we took both parts of our team to the #Azov sea shore.

Returning on Friday felt like rectifying part of this turbulent past we were living in, a feeling no doubt bolstered by BLINDNESS, the incredibly immersive audio production which has allowed the Donmar to reopen. Walter Meierjohann directs Simon Stephens\u2019 unsettling adaptation of Jos√© Saramago\u2019s book, voiced by actor nonpareil Juliet Stevenson with binaural sound design from the genius pair Ben and Max Ringham. The Ringhams\u2019 involvement was the ultimate selling point, after their production of ANNA at the National Theatre so riveted me in 2019. Blindness tells the story of a nation beset suddenly by a pandemic of sightlessness, exploring the descent into chaos and the psychological impact not only on the newly blinded but on the one person whose sight does not falter, who must see and bear witness to unspeakable things as a sickness both medical and social runs its course. Lizzie Clachan\u2019s design and Jessica Hung Han Yun\u2019s lighting facilitate the most perfectly jarring mise en sc√®ne, occupying and confusing the visual sense while Stevenson\u2019s performance totally engrosses the ears. The real highlight of the show is in its long steady moments of unnerving pitch darkness, Stevenson\u2019s voice and breath so close, the real world so distant and so \nunknowable. The shocking (and pertinent) plot is daringly hopeful, and though it\u2019s only just over an hour of theatre without any live performance, its intensity and immediacy resonate for hours after \u2013 and the world one emerges into afterwards is crisper, clearer, calmer. Thank you Donmar and all involved!\n*\n#donmarwarehouse #blindness #julietstevenson #jos√©saramago #josesaramago #benringham #maxringham #simonstephens #waltermeierjohann #lizzieclachan #jessicahunghanyun #theatre #donmar #play #binaural #audio #performance #monologue #narrative #novel #acting #directing #london #coventgarden #tourism #pandemic #covid19 #coronavirus #bookstagram","NumberOfLikes":33,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598436316,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 26 12:05:16 CEST 2020","Location":"Donmar Warehouse"},{"CaptionText":"Your custom art doesn't just have to be your family!\n\nLove a band and want cutom work of them?

Pelear en el ring o golpear el saco est√° m√°s ligado a la disciplina, la constancia, el esfuerzo, y la t√©cnica. Uno recibe a cambio equilibrio, fuerza, agilidad, y reflejos, en mi caso particular dir√© que tambi√©n paz mental y espiritual. No tienes que odiar a nadie para golpear con fuerza el punching, aunque hay que decir que ese sentimiento abandona el cuerpo cuando lanzas tu mejor gancho de derecha. La  ira, la verdad sea dicha, desconcentra en el combate, pero en el entrenamiento puede ser demoledora.\r\n√öltimamente noto que mi saco recibe golpes m√°s fuertes, muchos de ellos son los que le dar√≠a a ese condenado coronavirus, y otra buena cantidad de ellos vienen motivados por gente que no respeta las normas sanitarias. Poner en riesgo la vida y la econom√≠a de tantos puede ser m√°s molesto que el miedo al contagio, ese miedo que ahora forma parte de nuestras rutinas. Yo, y por supuesto mi pobre y maltrecho saco de boxeo, les pedimos que respeten  la vida de los dem√°s. Ya habr√° tiempo para abrazos, besos, o juergas locas. No le niegues a otra persona la posibilidad de disfrutar ese momento cuando llegue, pasando a ser un@ m√°s de los noqueados por el covid.\n\n#coronavirus #covid #corona  #quarantine  #staysafe #socialdistancing #virus  #coronav  #pandemic  #pandemia #instagram  #follow #quarentena","NumberOfLikes":6,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Khar√©_G. on August 26, 2020.

In early March, there was a publication where 100 patients were treated with chloroquine in 10 hospitals across Chinese cities. I made a statement that chloroquine is only for clinical trial treatment. There has to be a level of confidence that depends on the number of subjects and results.\u201D\u2063\n\u2063\nShe went on: \u201CWe did not know that the disease has four stages that include pre-exposure, early-stage, severe stage, and post-infection. At what stage that chloroquine will be more effective, we did not know at that time.\u2063\n\u2063\n\u201CWe are now understanding that it is not one drug that can be effective for COVID-19.
