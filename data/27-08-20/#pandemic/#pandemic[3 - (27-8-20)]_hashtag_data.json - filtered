Neuromed, with the participation of 33 #Italian hospitals, shows that the risk of death is 30% lower for #coronavirus patients treated with #hydroxychloroquine\n\nAn Italian observational study contributes to the ongoing debate regarding the use of hydroxychloroquine in the current #pandemic. The research, conducted on 3,451 patients treated in 33 hospitals throughout the Italian territory (list of participating centers attached), shows that the use of this drug reduces by 30% the risk of death in hospitalized patients affected by #Covid19.\n\nPublished in the European Journal of Internal Medicine, the study was coordinated by the Department of Epidemiology and Prevention of the I.R.C.C.S. Neuromed, Pozzilli, in collaboration with #MediterraneaCardiocentro, #Naples, and the #UniversityofPisa, with the participation of 33 hospitals forming the CORIST collaboration (#COvid-19 RISk and Treatments). Researchers analysed data regarding current and previous diseases, therapies followed before the infection and drugs administered in the hospital specifically for the treatment of COVID-19. All this information was compared with the evolution and the final in-hospital outcome of the infection.\n\n\u201CWe observed \u2013 explains Augusto Di Castelnuovo, epidemiologist at the Neuromed Department of Epidemiology and Prevention, currently at Mediterranea Cardiocentro in Naples \u2013 that patients treated with hydroxychloroquine had a 30% lower in-hospital mortality rate compared to those not receiving this treatment. Our data were subjected to extremely rigorous statistical analysis, taking into account all the variables and possible confounding factors that could come into play. The drug efficacy was evaluated in various subgroups of patients. The positive results of hydroxychloroquine treatment remained unchanged, especially in those patients showing a more evident inflammatory state at the moment of admission to hospital\u201D.\n\nüñêüèæMore in commentsüëáüèæ","NumberOfLikes":2983,"Hashtags":["#Italian","#coronavirus","#hydroxychloroquine","#pandemic.","#Covid19.","#MediterraneaCardiocentro,","#Naples,","#UniversityofPisa,","#COvid-19"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Exposing Lies & Sharing Truth on August 25, 2020.

Having labored for more than 30 hours with my first born, I can tell you with certainty that such a measure is pure torture and will lead to more medical interventions.  This is Dr. Mengele style medical Tyranny!\n.\nUnder the guise of this virus, women are forced to deliver while laying on their backs, which is the most difficult way to give birth.  This has absolutely no medical basis and it\u2019s merely yet another abuse inflicted on a woman while she is most vulnerable and will undoubtedly lead to more dangerous medical interventions (like episiotomy).\n.\nBut if all these abuses are not enough, if the totally worthless covid test comes back positive, the new mother is separated from her newborn baby.  This will have life long repercussions and it is the most cruel punishment for both mother and baby.  The first few hours after the birth are extraordinarily important to produce the bonding between mother and baby.  Hormones adjust, colostrum is triggered,  providing the baby with life saving immunity. \n.\nThese monsters, these pseudo-humans who mandate these inhumane policies need to be tarred and feathered, for they are ruining lives!\n.\nI gave birth at home to both of my children.  Giving birth in American Hospitals was already a nightmarish experience.  Terms like \u201CBirth Rape\u201D describe what happens to women there, but giving birth there in the Age of Covid is pure torture!

There\u2019s a couple of moments in there that I think will be really key,\u201D Grisham said. \u201CAnd then it\u2019s really, really forward-looking and to not only what she wants to do in the next four years, but why she thinks the president is best for our country.\u201D \n\nJust like Trump has upended norms of the presidency, Melania Trump has altered what it means to be a modern first lady, from¬†continuing to live in New York City in the administration's opening months¬†to¬†forcing the ouster of a deputy national security adviser. \n\nNot since Nancy Reagan has any first lady asserted herself so publicly in West Wing personnel matters.

Workers operating under the H-2B visa program have their temperature checked before picking crab at Russel Hall Seafood in Fishing Creek. Covid-19 has forced seafood businesses to adapt to new social distancing and health protocols. \n\n2. Blue crabs are pulled out of an industrial steamer at Russell Hall Seafood. Each crab will be hand-picked before being shipped and sold as lump crab meat. Sponge crabs\u2014female crabs that are carrying unhatched eggs\u2014are only legal to harvest in Virginia. Each sponge may contain anywhere from 750,000 to 8 million eggs, with the average sponge containing 2 million already fertilized and developing crabs. \n\n3. Workers pick crabs at Russell Hall Seafood. Russell Hall is one of only two out of the five picking houses on Hoopers Island that were awarded visas for workers this year. Mark Phillips, son of Russel Hall owner Harry Phillips, says \u201Cit doesn\u2019t just hurt his business, but the whole community,\u201D as watermen have fewer places to offload their catch. \u201CWe\u2019ve had job fairs everywhere, Baltimore to Washington, people just aren\u2019t going to do it,\u201D Phillips said. \u201CIf I had to run this business and rely on Americans, I\u2019d sell it today.\u201D \n\n4. A painted fishing boat in Tilghman Island voices its owner\u2019s support for President Trump, whose administration has acted to reduce the number of visas available to seafood processors. Watermen are predominantly conservative and Trump flags fly from many workboats. \n\n5. American Flags rest inside the shuttered Phillips Packing Company in Cambridge.

Normally, at this time of year, my British colleagues and I would be either on our way to \u2013 or already in \u2013 New York for the start of the US Open.\n\nInstead, we find ourselves stuck at home and watching the relocated Cincinnati event on TV as it is played out in Queens, NY. We are all suffering the usual jetlag (the five-hour time difference means that you are starting you working day at 4pm at the earliest and who knows when you will finish) but none of us are having the fun of being in the Big Apple.\n\nIn normal times in NY, you can get on the bus at 3am, get back to the city at 3.30am (3.15am if the driver puts his foot down \u2013 as he often does at that time of night) and always find a bar to go to, a diner to eat at, a place to chill and relax\u2026happy days.\n\nWhen you are stuck in Ramsay Towers in Weybridge, you watch a match finish at gone midnight (with the headphones, natch, in so as not to disturb the neighbours) and once the presser is over an hour later, you kick back, look at your watch and think \u2018rats, I\u2019ve nothing in the fridge, I\u2019ve run out of tonic and the electrician is coming here at 8am to fix the shower\u2026\u2019 It is not particularly glamourous. Added to which, the neighbours think I\u2019m some sort of vampiric weirdo.\n\nBut watching an American tournament on British TV (albeit streamed TV) gives a whole new view of the event. When you are there, there is an ebb and flow to every day. You wake up when the players wake up (well, may be an hour or so later); you live in their time zone.
