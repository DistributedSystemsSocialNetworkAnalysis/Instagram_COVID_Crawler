We would not like to endanger anyone due to our celebration. It is only wise to wait for the vaccine.\u201D\n\nShe further added, \u201CThis was inevitable. There\u2019s nothing we could do to control this, so we took a sensible decision. In the second week of March itself, we had decided that we won\u2019t get married in these conditions. People traveling would face a health risk and safety is most important right now\u201D.\n\n#richachadha #alifazal #richaali #pandemic2020 #EastFM #EastFmKenya #RadioAfrica","NumberOfLikes":27,"Hashtags":["#richachadha","#alifazal","#richaali","#pandemic2020","#EastFM","#EastFmKenya","#RadioAfrica"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by East FM Kenya on August 26, 2020.

Sementara pembagian ditargetkan pembagian terhadap 15,7 juta pekerja penerima BSU tersebut tuntas hingga akhir September mendatang.\n\n\"Ini yang kita luncurkan hari ini 2,5 juta. Kami harapkan nanti di bulan September selesai 15,7 juta pekerja,\" kata Jokowi di Istana Negara, Jakarta.\n\nDijelaskan Jokowi, masing-masing pekerja yang menerima BSU senilai Rp 600ribu per bulan untuk selama empat bulan. Akan mendapatkan pencairan atau transer BSU per dua bulan sekali. Dengan besaran BSU yang diterima yakni senilai Rp 1,2juta.\n\n\"Sekali dua bulan akan ditransfer sebesar satu juta dua ratus ribu rupiah, jadi dalam empat bulan akan berlangsung sebanyak 2 kali transfer BSU,\" lanjutnya.\n\nPresiden Jokowi juga menjelaskan, para pekerja yang mendapatkan bantuan subsidi upah tersebut merupakan peserta aktif BPJS Ketenagakerjaan hingga Juni 2020. Menurut Jokowi, ini dilakukan sebagai bentuk penghargaan kepada perusahaan yang selama ini patuh membayar iuran BPJS Ketenagakerjaan.\n\nDengan diberikannnya bantuan ini, Jokowi berharap konsumsi rumah tangga masyarakat akan meningkat. Dengan demikian, hal tersebut bisa mendongkrak ekonomi Indonesia ke depannya.\n\n\"Semuanya terpengaruh dan itu di dalam angka-angka yang setiap pagi saya lihat, memang faktanya seperti itu.

I don\u2019t actually believe there are any experts who can tell our future for sure as C19 is \u201Cnovel\u201D that nobody has the full knowledge of, but I can confirm at least one thing, that this virus has changed our way of travelling for the time being.\n\nI flew to London from Seoul with Etihad Airways last night.\nThe Incheon International Airport was always crowded at any time of the day before, but it was totally empty last night. There were a lot more staff than passengers, even though most businesses were closed.\n\nI arrived at the airport 3.5 hours before the departure, just in case there are delays due to additional stuff to do because of C19. And it was totally the right decision.\n\nI first went to a spot to get my luggage wrapped with film for hygiene. Both the check-in and the carry-on luggage. It cost me about US$25.\n\nWhen I went to the check in counter of the airline, a staff asked me if I had any masks in my check-in luggage, I said yes, and the staff advised to transfer them to the carry-on luggage because the Customs needs to check them as I can take only upto 30 masks out of Korea. The staff also said that I could take 150 masks if I am a resident overseas. Phew\u2026 I am a resident in UK. I had 120 masks on me.\n\nSo I went back to the wrapping station which is located at the far end of the departure level, tore the wrapping up, transferred the masks to my carry-on luggage and got my check-in luggage wrapped again. It cost me another US$15.\n\nTo be continued...\n\n#covid19 #pandemic2020 #c19story #travel #airtravel #travelwithcoronavirus #lifewithcoronavirus","NumberOfLikes":7,"Hashtags":["#11.","#covid19","#pandemic2020","#c19story","#travel","#airtravel","#travelwithcoronavirus","#lifewithcoronavirus"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598483740,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 27 01:15:40 CEST 2020","Location":"인천공항 Incheon Airport"},{"Owner":"electramayhem","CaptionText":"2020 weddings be like. 😷💐 \/\/ \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#pandemic2020 #pandemicwedding #richandtammy #maskchic #neverfullydressedwithoutamask","NumberOfLikes":77,"Hashtags":["#pandemic2020","#pandemicwedding","#richandtammy","#maskchic","#neverfullydressedwithoutamask"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by b. in Aberfoyle Mill with @jordan.larocque.

Boa parte do grupo ainda cursa o ensino médio e se divide entre aulas e reuniões para fazer atos que desafiam parlamentares, governadores e ministros de Estado. \n\nAlguns têm pretensões eleitorais.\n\nO movimento aceita participantes de até 29 anos, mas os seus destaques estão na faixa de 17 a 20. Depois de dezenas de milhares deles irem às ruas na Europa em 2019 contra o aquecimento global, novos atos estão previstos em Bruxelas em setembro contra a ratificação do acordo de livre-comércio entre o Mercosul e a União Europeia, aposta do governo Jair Bolsonaro na área econômica.\n\nUm dos participantes do ato é o brasileiro Abel Rodrigues, que se mudou de Belém (PA) para Lisboa em 2018. Aos 20 anos, ele conheceu Greta num evento em Portugal no qual os dois discursaram e decidiu entrar para o Fridays for Future.\n\n\u201CHá uma pressão gigantesca na Europa para que esse acordo seja derrubado porque o Brasil não tem nenhum respeito pela proteção ambiental. As pessoas sabem as consequências negativas que é fazer lobby para rejeitar um acordo econômico desse nível, que pode levar até mesmo à recessão econômica de alguns países do Mercosul, mas a gente sabe que é muito mais urgente e necessário salvar a Amazônia e defender os povos indígenas. O Fridays vai se preparar para ir ao Parlamento e à Comissão Europeia para falar \u2018olha, a Europa não pode ratificar esse acordo\u2019\u201D, afirmou Rodrigues.\n\nLink na bio. \n\nFonte: Estadão\n\n#covid19 #coronavirus #ONN #onovonormal #ONNpoliticapublica #covidart #covid2020, #covid19brasil #covidmask #covidphotodiaries #covidnews #covid19art #corona #coronavírus #coronavirusbrazil #coronaviruspandemic #coronavirusoutbreak #coronavirus2020 #pandemicart #pandemic2020, #pandemicorona #pandemiclife #fiqueemcasa  #homeoffice #trabalhandoemcasa #emcasa  #usemask #mask #gretathunberg #fridaysforfuture","NumberOfLikes":9,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#coronavirus","#ONN","#onovonormal","#ONNpoliticapublica","#covidart","#covid2020,","#covid19brasil","#covidmask","#covidphotodiaries","#covidnews","#covid19art","#corona","#coronavírus","#coronavirusbrazil","#coronaviruspandemic","#coronavirusoutbreak","#coronavirus2020","#pandemicart","#pandemic2020,","#pandemicorona","#pandemiclife","#fiqueemcasa","#homeoffice","#trabalhandoemcasa","#emcasa","#usemask","#mask","#gretathunberg","#fridaysforfuture"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by O Novo Normal in São Paulo, Brazil.

I am perfectly happy to be at home. I am the ultimate homebody. Even having some of my favorite beverages not available....I can deal. I love my kiddos being home. I love seeing their faces and getting snuggles every morning while we both wake up to start our day. I honestly look forward to that as usually I would be at the office by the time they opened their eyes. Being with them 24\/7 doesn\u2019t \u201Cget\u201D to me. My children not having their normalcy is what gets to me.\n.\n\nToday I had to pick up some things for my little guys from what they had left in the classroom last year and some things to start this year. Their school system is amazing and I love it. You get to know the amazing teachers and they all know your kids. Living in a small community has its advantages. But knowing my kiddos don\u2019t get their typical start sucks. I get it. I just don\u2019t like it for them. There is something exciting with starting a new school year, finding your new desk, meeting your teacher and seeing friends everyday. So being the goober I am, I teared up taking in all these things into the house today. Their first day of school will be with their Mama in the next room and a teacher via the computer. I want normalcy back for them. For now I\u2019ll just put on a smiley face and tell them how exciting it is and how I never got to start school quite like this.\n. \n#pandemic2020 #pandemicschooling \n#parentingishard","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#pandemic2020","#pandemicschooling","#parentingishard"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Diana Michelle on August 26, 2020.

Just what my thoughts are in these challenging times... A Pandemic Season\n\n Cancelled travels, crumpled plans, changes in work settings and endless worries for our health and those of our loved ones.\n\nOver half of the year has passed and not much has been ticked from our goals, plans and things to be done.\n\nVirtual meetings, online parties, social media are means to connect with people we used to spend time with.\n\nIn these trying times and quiet moments our lives, we pray for miracles and that ray of hope that things will be better in the season of Christmas wreaths.\n\nDeep within us there is a clash of optimism, worry, compassion, sadness and fear in times like these.\n\nPandemic can be stressful for all of us affected in varying degrees.\n\nAllow ourselves to deal with the now by taking time to process our emotions as we prepare for what lies ahead that is still unknown.\n\nNew normal that is how it will be from now on, but has it been normal for us before?\n\nDespite all the challenges brought about by COVID and more.\n\nEvery new day is a blessing for coping and experiencing the many blessings in disguise.\n\nMay we all be recipients of kindness, care, healing and all the help we need.\n\nI can only hope and pray that situation can be more friendly.\n\nCan you be a little kinder and please slow down 2020?\n\nCan you spot words going down from the 1st letter of each line.

So what did I do? I cleaned my kitchen. \n.\nAs a Type A person, I admit that one of the crappiest things about this pandemic is having little to no control about stuff that I used to plan and execute properly. There are probably a hundred things that I could have done better in my personal life, job, grad school, and side jobs if not for this virus. About 80% of my frustrations are deeply rooted in things that I cannot control anymore because of current circumstances. \n.\nHere's where keeping our kitchen tidy becomes a sanity-saver. I have control over how organized our pantry is and how long I want the cleaning process to take. I guess even for a little while, the act of taking back that control reminds me that not everything is lost in the world just yet. Of course, this is just me. I'm pretty sure others are going through times that are way tougher than mine - may it be financial, medical, physiological, or emotional. Still, it helps to identify your personal triggers and struggles, plus how to address them. It just happened that this is how I handled mine. \n.\nBottom line is, clean your space. It will help, promise.

We pulled out art supplies and let the kids go to town.  When I pulled out that EXACT bag of pompoms all the kids started laughing so hard.  They grabbed all the sparkly, spiky pompoms and started chanting COVID! COVID!  I couldn\u2019t believe it.  All the moms looked at each other, smiled, and shrugged. \u201CIt does look like it,\u201D we said.  I thought to myself, at least the kids are laughing. \n\nBut what a crazy world we are living in, right? Only 6 months ago, that same pack of kids would have been so pumped about glittery, sparkling crafting crap...🤷\u200D♀️Now they see a virus. \n\nBeyond the obvious, how has your world view on the simple things changed? How about your kids? Do you think it will stay forever changed? Is it all really bad? \n\nI will be honest.  I think it is a little bit of both.  While it is no fun that we see the virus everywhere. Crafts. Coughs. Handshakes and hugs. Maybe it isn\u2019t the worst that when we do allow ourselves to have those moments we savor them.  That we appreciate the teachers and how they turn themselves inside out to make all the days creative, loving, educational, fun.  That we have ventured outside. Spent time with our loved ones.  Listened to not just our kids arguine but HOW they argue.  Wondered about the future... \n\nI don\u2019t know.  Those little humans still make me nuts. But then... at the end of the day... they still fight over who is going to sit next to Mom.

The genome organization of this viral strain is different from the known genome structure of SARS-COV-2. Reinfection is quite a peculiar state  because the host remains in asymptomatic condition whilst the immune system counteracts the infection. Important warriors from adaptive immunity- killer T cells and memory B cells may play role in fighting the virus. It's unlike viral reactivation wherein symptoms are conspicuous. As interesting as it seems, it is still unclear if the reinfected individuals are potent enough to transmit the virus. Based on one case, can it be said that the immune system of our body can solve the problems of infection? NO. We still have to take the measures, don't think social distancing will be withdrawn anytime soon. :p\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#letstalkscience #sarscov2 #covid19 #pandemic #pandemic2020 #hongkongcase #hongkong #reinfection #reinfectionwithcovid19 #sarscov2reinfection #adaptiveimmunesystem #tcells #bcells #viraltransmission #viralreactivation #viralreinfection #socialdistancing #shotononeplus #shotononeplus5t #instagram","NumberOfLikes":79,"Hashtags":["#letstalkscience","#sarscov2","#covid19","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#hongkongcase","#hongkong","#reinfection","#reinfectionwithcovid19","#sarscov2reinfection","#adaptiveimmunesystem","#tcells","#bcells","#viraltransmission","#viralreactivation","#viralreinfection","#socialdistancing","#shotononeplus","#shotononeplus5t","#instagram"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":15,"Timestamp":1598438268,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 26 12:37:48 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"sophia.comics","CaptionText":"\"Get well soon, World ❤️\"\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#covid #covid19 #pandemic2020\n#coronavirus #illustration #illustraiongram #sophiacomics #love","NumberOfLikes":14,"Hashtags":["#covid","#covid19","#pandemic2020","#coronavirus","#illustration","#illustraiongram","#sophiacomics","#love"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Sophia's Comics on August 26, 2020.

We went to the mall the other day just to start her school shopping here. \n\nThis was supposed to be her big year! First year no uniforms, new school and getting older everyday. It was not supposed to be closed. It was not supposed to be empty. She was not supposed to be instantly crushed and brought to tears by the darkness and the few empty racks left there. \n\nTo some this is just a store but to her it was her growing independence of having \u201Cher\u201D store filled to the ceiling with her styles. Her place! She could always find 1 or 5 things every time we went to the mall. Yes, we can buy online but to a 9 year old it is not the same. \n\nThis pandemic has been hard on us all but dang it my heart breaks for these kid\u2019s.

They are having their schools go online or a few hours at a time, they haven\u2019t gotten to see friends, grandparents or teachers, they have to wear masks everywhere they go and I can feel the anxiety enter their sweet bodies at just going to the store. \n\nThis is hard. We pray every single night that things get better so we can fully appreciate living our lives to the fullest everyday. We pray for healing.

Today\u2019s stop on my pandemic Hollywood tour is the house that the Lopez family supposedly lived in on the show!\n\n\u201CThe George Lopez Show\u201D house was originally built in 1885, making it the second-oldest home in San Fernando. The idyllic, Victorian, 4-bedroom, single family residence was commissioned by Senator Charles Maclay, a founder of San Fernando, and his wife, Catherine Paxton Maclay.\n\nThe Lopez family home from show is located at \u202A671 Fourth Street in San Fernando\u202C. Thankfully, the property looks much the same in person as it did onscreen, though it has since been painted green. Please note that this is a private residence so if you visit please do not trespass or disturb the people that live there.\n\n\u201CThe George Lopez Show\u201D originally aired for six seasons on ABC from 2002 to 2007. It is currently in syndication on Nick at Nite, and stars the titular comedian George Lopez, who plays a fictionalized version of himself and revolves around his life at work and raising his family at home.\n\nLopez drew much of the material for the show from his own life experiences, especially his upbringing in the San Fernando Valley. Lopez was one of the few Latinos to star in a television comedy series, following in the footsteps of Desi Arnaz, Freddie Prinze, and John Leguizamo.\n\nFun facts - The sitcom would have never existed without Oscar winning actress Sandra Bullock. In 2000, Bullock saw Lopez perform live at the Brea Improv Comedy Club. Bullock had been interested in developing a TV show with a Latino storyline, being concerned about the lack of visibility for Latinos on American television. Bullock approached Lopez backstage after the show and made her pitch to produce and star in a situational comedy centered around the comedian. \n\nFor the first five seasons, the show had an all-Latino cast with the exception of Albanian American actress Masiela Lusha, who played George\u2019s daughter Carmen.\n\nThe character \u201CGeorge Lopez\" was ranked #18 in \"TV Guide\"'s list of the \"50 Greatest TV Dads of All Time\"#filminglocation #thegeorgelopezshow #sanfernando #hollywoodtour #pandemic2020 #socialdistancing #wearamask #tonymiros","NumberOfLikes":32,"Hashtags":["#18","#filminglocation","#thegeorgelopezshow","#sanfernando","#hollywoodtour","#pandemic2020","#socialdistancing","#wearamask","#tonymiros"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1598374016,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 18:46:56 CEST 2020","Location":"San Fernando Valley"},{"Owner":"travsolo","CaptionText":"Narrow streets has ways of bringing you closer to beautiful realities 🇲🇦 \n\u2060\nCool #solotravel 📸 by @boifromvenus\n\u2060\nFollow & Tag @travsolo on your awesome travel pics for a chance to be featured! ✈️\u2060\n.\u2060\n.\u2060\n.\u2060\n.\u2060\n.\u2060\n.\u2060\n.\u2060\n#solofemaletraveller #socialdistancingworks #extrovertedintrovert\u2063 #solotraveler #solotravelingisfun #solotraveling #girlstravel #globaltravel #covidtravel #pandemic2020 #pandemictravel #covidtravel2020 #morrocco","NumberOfLikes":37,"Hashtags":["#solotravel","#solofemaletraveller","#socialdistancingworks","#extrovertedintrovert\u2063","#solotraveler","#solotravelingisfun","#solotraveling","#girlstravel","#globaltravel","#covidtravel","#pandemic2020","#pandemictravel","#covidtravel2020","#morrocco"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Solo Travel Easier on August 25, 2020.

Gak kerasa ya udh mau 6 bulan kita berjuang melawan Covid-19. Pasti selama masa pandemi ini banyak kesulitan, perubahan, penyesuaian yg kita hadapi dan lakukan yaa. Salah satu contoh yg Ruchi alami sendiri adalah saat adopsi. \n\nBeberapa waktu yg lalu 2 kitten adopsi Ruchi dengan terpaksa dikembalikan karena adopter yg adalah seorang mahasiswa harus pulang kampung ada urusan mendadak. Opsi untuk membawa serta anabul yg baru saja teradopsi gak memungkinkan karena pasti akan berpengaruh ke psikis mereka. Not to mention the cost of shipping, masa karantina, pemeriksaan kesehatan kucing, dsbnya. Opsi anabul dititipkan pun mustahil karena kucing yg baru teradopsi sebaiknya berada pada kondisi yg stress-free sedangkan jika dititipkan kucing harus dikandangin, berbagi ruangan dengan banyak kucing, terlebih kitten yg diadopsi ini gak pernah berinteraksi dengan kucing2 lain. Jelas akan memicu stres. Selain itu, adopter juga gak bisa memastikan kapan balik ke Malang karena perkuliahan dilakukan secara daring.

God plants these beautiful desires in our hearts, (unique to each individual) we water them together in hope, prayer & intimacy with Him. Then they grow into bloom in season~ the beauty meant to be shared. It always points back to Him, because it all started with him. We can\u2019t take credit. \n\nThis is the home we\u2019ve been waiting, believing & praying for for nearly 20 years. We felt that without the right timing it wouldn\u2019t have the impact it was meant to, so we waited until we felt a release. \nSpeaking of IMPACT~ December 2019 we stepped out in faith, believing that so much good was coming. It DID. In spite of all that came with Covid~ which included a major loss of income immediately after our down payment. God gave us a gift during a challenging season we never could have anticipated. The joy that came through this process of building was the SWEETEST gift, and it only secures the confidence in my heart that God is kind. Our girls experienced that joy with us & I can\u2019t help but think of all they would have missed out on if the timing was different... even months earlier or later. \nThe reason this carries so much joy for us is because we used to be filled with disappointment for years, and we blamed it unknowingly on God. The past 5 or so years especially we\u2019ve been unlearning some of our negative ideology of God~ that process has been painful, amazing & freeing. Its so easy to associate our past, our pain, our hard experiences with God- yet we needed to learn that God cares so deeply about our past, our pain, and our hard experiences. Before we received this gift, we needed to understand that our blame was misplaced- God has always been a loving Father- it\u2019s our misinterpretation of Him & our lens that has shifted. \nYou\u2019ll have to sit with me here at our house & let me share all the details of God\u2019s goodness with you, b\/c I haven\u2019t even scratched the surface. \nYou are so welcome here 🤍\n#miraclehome #miracleshappen #beautiful\n#pandemic2020 #homesweethome","NumberOfLikes":91,"Hashtags":["#miraclehome","#miracleshappen","#beautiful","#pandemic2020","#homesweethome"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":30,"Timestamp":1598363885,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 15:58:05 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"lynn_nicholls","CaptionText":"I\u2019m baaaaacccckkk!

You will get stuck and time will pass you by. A few months in this pandemic, I was finding myself semi stuck. I wasn\u2019t looking back but I wasn\u2019t really moving forward either. One day my friend Camille @camille_mcintyre told me about a 10 Day Challenge To Get Unstuck. I didn\u2019t participate in the challenge but I watched her. She challenge herself to interview ladies from all walks of life every Monday. Yes, Monday!!!! Because of her I was inspired to do a Wednesday Bible study once a week. I chose Wednesday because before the pandemic I would do my Women\u2019s Jail Ministry, but the pandemic cancelled it. So, I decided to replace it with a Bible study on Instagram for you ladies and gentlemen. Yes, I have a few faithful gentlemen cheering me on too ladies.\n.\n.\nCamille is so dedicated and devoted to her work in God and on helping us ladies as well. I\u2019m proud to say she\u2019s my inspiration and I\u2019ve found a true friend. I love working with her at The What Lies Beyond event with our friend Doris @dmcushite. By the way, please stop by Doris account, she\u2019s having another event in September. Please register and be blessed again if you attended the first event. Thanks Camille for allowing God to use you to get me unstuck.\n.\n.\nSo remember two things ladies and gentlemen!! Firstly, Forget those toxic things that are behind you and let\u2019s start reaching forth to those great things God have before us. Secondly, remember Lot\u2019s wife. Don\u2019t spirituality or naturally turn to a pillar of salt. Let\u2019s get unstuck and keep moving.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#unstuck #stuck #stuckathome #pandemic #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife #getunstuck #challenge #moveforward #keepgoing #keepmoving #keepmovingforward #timeisnow #timewaitsfornoman #timeispassing #dontlookback #getup #getupandmove #getupandgrind #getupandgo #inspirationalwords #motivational #motivated #motivationforlife #fromthemasterstable #womeninspiringwomen #womensupportwomen #encouragingwords #movingforward #challengeyourself","NumberOfLikes":47,"Hashtags":["#unstuck","#stuck","#stuckathome","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#pandemiclife","#getunstuck","#challenge","#moveforward","#keepgoing","#keepmoving","#keepmovingforward","#timeisnow","#timewaitsfornoman","#timeispassing","#dontlookback","#getup","#getupandmove","#getupandgrind","#getupandgo","#inspirationalwords","#motivational","#motivated","#motivationforlife","#fromthemasterstable","#womeninspiringwomen","#womensupportwomen","#encouragingwords","#movingforward","#challengeyourself"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Delphine Kirkland on August 25, 2020 tagging @victoriadavisgilbert, @camille_mcintyre, @dmcushite, @belovedofmine, @anuonasanya, @imperishable.beauty, @raisingfaithwarriors, @thechurchgirlwrites, @wilmahollislifespeak, and @warriorwomenic.
