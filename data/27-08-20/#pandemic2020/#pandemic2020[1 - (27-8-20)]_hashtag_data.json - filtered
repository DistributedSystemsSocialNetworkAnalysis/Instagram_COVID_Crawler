I don\u2019t actually believe there are any experts who can tell our future for sure as C19 is \u201Cnovel\u201D that nobody has the full knowledge of, but I can confirm at least one thing, that this virus has changed our way of travelling for the time being.\n\nI flew to London from Seoul with Etihad Airways last night.\nThe Incheon International Airport was always crowded at any time of the day before, but it was totally empty last night. There were a lot more staff than passengers, even though most businesses were closed.\n\nI arrived at the airport 3.5 hours before the departure, just in case there are delays due to additional stuff to do because of C19. And it was totally the right decision.\n\nI first went to a spot to get my luggage wrapped with film for hygiene. Both the check-in and the carry-on luggage. It cost me about US$25.\n\nWhen I went to the check in counter of the airline, a staff asked me if I had any masks in my check-in luggage, I said yes, and the staff advised to transfer them to the carry-on luggage because the Customs needs to check them as I can take only upto 30 masks out of Korea. The staff also said that I could take 150 masks if I am a resident overseas. Phew\u2026 I am a resident in UK. I had 120 masks on me.\n\nSo I went back to the wrapping station which is located at the far end of the departure level, tore the wrapping up, transferred the masks to my carry-on luggage and got my check-in luggage wrapped again. It cost me another US$15.\n\nTo be continued...\n\n#covid19 #pandemic2020 #c19story #travel #airtravel #travelwithcoronavirus #lifewithcoronavirus","NumberOfLikes":2,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598483740,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 27 01:15:40 CEST 2020","Location":"Ïù∏Ï≤úÍ≥µÌï≠ Incheon Airport"},{"CaptionText":"üòÇüòÇüòÇ they just don\u2019t deserve it!\n-\n-\n-\n#weareback #lashgamestrong #quarantinelife #pandemic2020 #pandemiclashes #luxlashloungetips #luxlashlounge #coronavirus #coronaviruspandemic #covid_19 #stayhealthy #staystrong #wegotthis #quarantinediaries #quarantine #quarantineandchill #quarantinelife #quarantinememes\n#brooklynbeauties #brooklynbabes #eyelashextensionsnyc #marineparkbrooklyn #brooklynstylist #lashextentions #nyclashes #glamourlashes #lashesonlashes #lashlovers #made_in_nyc #lashmapping","NumberOfLikes":63,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Eyelash Extensions üëÅüëÅ in Lux Lash Lounge.

Based on the depth of suffering I\u2019ve experienced over the decades, I plainly disagree with this notion.\n\nSuffering, my lifelong companion, is inevitable and unavoidable. It humbles me. More than once it has brought me to my knees. It exposes my most tender wounds, revealing my capacity to despair and love in equal measure.\n\nI practice on the daily not to avoid suffering, but to work well with my suffering so that I may suffer less. Yes, I still suffer, and I know I am so much more than my suffering. \n\nIn the current reality that is Struggle Bus 2020, we are probably all experiencing elevated levels of suffering. With no discernible \u201Cend\u201D in sight, the biggest win some days might just be getting out of bed at a reasonable hour and putting on pants that aren\u2019t pajamas.\n\n@dannipomplun and I dive into an honest conversation about the struggles we\u2019ve been going through on his most recent podcast.

Those who have lost loved ones or have suffered through Covid themselves are going to feel strongly about the need for masks. A business owner who is not permitted to operate at full capacity is stressed over lost profits and potential closure due to Covid restrictions. Parents are scared to send their kids back to school. Teachers are putting themselves at risk in order to educate our children. Essential employees are tired of having to wear a mask all day while also having to enforce it on argumentative customers. We are all struggling with this for one reason or another.\n..\n..\nAt the end of the day it\u2019s our kids who are in the middle. How we react to the craziness around us and how we treat others who have different opinions than us filters down to our kids in the form of a life lesson. You don\u2019t have to change your opinion..but have compassion. Try to see someone\u2019s opinion through their own experience..not yours. Show your kids you can disagree but can still listen and see some validity in what the opposing side has to say. \n..\n..\nThis is the time to teach our kids the value of perseverance and how to thrive when circumstances aren\u2019t exactly what we wanted or thought they would be. This is when we teach them to be compassionate instead of judgmental. Be careful. Your actions carry more weight than you think. \n..\n..\n..\n#backtoschool #mask #covid19 #newnormal #bekind #unity #perseverance #perspective #selfdevelopment #bethechange #helponeanother #parenting #parenthood #pandemic #pandemiclife #pandemic2020 #momlife #momsofinstagram #momof3","NumberOfLikes":22,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598472703,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 26 22:11:43 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"2020 so far has given us heartbreak, loss, fear and a full catalogue of challenges but each one of are getting through it.

Good quality education is one of those things. Thanks to COVID, I\u2019m all shaken up about what to expect. I\u2019m scared, nervous, anxious, just to name a few. I don\u2019t know what to expect and I\u2019m relying on Allah (SWT) to guide me in the right direction. I\u2019m praying for patience, perseverance, discipline, and health to aid my babies in their new journey. A cyberlearning journey.\n\nI had other fantasies about seeing my 5-year-old start kindergarten and it\u2019s all out the wind I now. I was hoping he\u2019d learn to be more work-oriented and focused in a school setting. Now, he\u2019ll be stuck home on a computer. And I know this pandemic has been happening for months now, but I\u2019m still upset about what is happening and the turn of events. I wasn\u2019t ready. No one was.\n\nI have adapted to the new norm of being at home the majority of the time but incorporating things like elementary school, homework, and strict schedules scare me again because someway somehow... I\u2019m still grieving. \n\nMay Allah help us mothers with one child and more, because just because you have one, doesn\u2019t make it easier. It\u2019s a struggle for us all. May Allah bless the teachers and give them all the clarity, motivation to push forward every day for our littles, and for that new homeschooling and cyberlearning mama, I pray Allah gives you all the support and strength you need to pull through and show up for your babies. They need us to be resilient. Be easy on them and on your self and if there ever comes a bad day when you\u2019re ready to give up, know this: it\u2019s temporary. Start new tomorrow with a Clean slate.\n\nThere\u2019s one factor Allah gave us in abundance and that\u2019s time. Make the most of it and always remember that we are capable of anything we set our minds to!

We pulled out art supplies and let the kids go to town.  When I pulled out that EXACT bag of pompoms all the kids started laughing so hard.  They grabbed all the sparkly, spiky pompoms and started chanting COVID! COVID!  I couldn\u2019t believe it.  All the moms looked at each other, smiled, and shrugged. \u201CIt does look like it,\u201D we said.

How about your kids? Do you think it will stay forever changed? Is it all really bad? \n\nI will be honest.  I think it is a little bit of both.  While it is no fun that we see the virus everywhere. Crafts. Coughs. Handshakes and hugs. Maybe it isn\u2019t the worst that when we do allow ourselves to have those moments we savor them.  That we appreciate the teachers and how they turn themselves inside out to make all the days creative, loving, educational, fun.  That we have ventured outside. Spent time with our loved ones.  Listened to not just our kids arguine but HOW they argue.  Wondered about the future... \n\nI don\u2019t know.  Those little humans still make me nuts.

From the worldwide impact on football activities due to the Covid-19 Pandemic, to the record setting results we witnessed once the competitions restarted, this year's tournaments are surely memorable. \n\nOne major change to this year's tournaments was the decision to restart the games in single match knockout ties at neutral venues, starting with the quarter-finals.\n\nThe decision to restart the leagues without the typical home and away matches was due to the impact the corona virus pandemic had on the competitions. Due to the delays in restarting the tournaments, the concerns over the risk of infection, and travel restrictions across Europe, the organizers decided to play the remaining games in single match elimination format on neutral venues located in the country designated to host the finals.\n\nThis resulted in all remaining Europa League matches being played in single match knockout ties at neutral venues in Germany, while all remaining Champions League single match knockout ties were played at neutral venues in Portugal.\n\nTournament organizers are now considering whether to keep playing future games using the single match knockout ties at neutral venues format starting at the quarter-final stage.\n\nThough single match knockout ties may seem like an entertaining way to watch the tournament for many, and potentially fewer games will keep players more refreshed during the competition, the financial implications may in the end prove to be the deciding factor in their decision.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n#soccerposts90 #championsleague #europaleague #football #soccer #uefa #fifa #bayernmunich\n#psg #sevilla #intermilan #soccerposts #gol #goal #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":4,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598421064,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 26 07:51:04 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Remember that time local businesses banded together to support small businesses who are doing it tough?","NumberOfLikes":12,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @covid_captures in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

Homeschool parents, no judgment here!\n\nEach situation is different. Each student is different.

No. I shared this today because I scroll my social media feed I see so many parents asking questions around homeschooling, complaining about virtual learning, trying to get answers for all the hard situations we find ourselves in as parents of young children.\n\nI don\u2019t have the answer, I wish they were an easy one size fits all solution, but there\u2019s not.

Honestly over the years I\u2019ve just given up and basically let him in on what I had up my sleeve because if he wants something, he\u2019s quick to order it for himself, leaving me in several predicaments of needing to tell him about my surprise anyways. \n\nBut this year was different üòè I\u2019m not sure if I should thank the pandemic, his job for keeping him super busy or Henry for always keeping us on our toes BUT @kuys33 for once had ZERO idea what I had up my sleeve. \n\nKudos to your girl for making it happen!!! No, but seriously, this man deserves this and so much more. I\u2019m so appreciative of how he bends over backwards for our little family. He truly is the husband of my dreams (even with his sarcasm and all). \n\nI hope you enjoyed yourself, my love. \n\nOn a side note, I love that a guy came up to us at the beach and asked if he could take a pic of the setup because he was so in awe of what the @thepicnic.collective had done, we said sure no problem and as he was walking away he said \u201Cyou\u2019re a lucky wife, you have such a loving husband\u201D and Alex right away responded \u201CI\u2019m the lucky one!

That was the last trip I took the NYC before the virus had spread so much that New York State issued an emergency self-isolation protocol and everyone began working from home.\n\nThat's when I wondered, as an architect with product design capabilities, how can I help? A handful of my friends expressed the same question and I remember talking to @archivalley about this question.\n\nThe day after we discussed different ways I could help, I discovered a forum for makers to connect and fabricate products to help protect our medical professionals from the virus. I met a gentleman named Jacob B. who generously donated his time and 3D printer to make the visor portions of face shields. He was looking for someone with a laser cutter to make the face shield parts so he can assemble and deliver the final face shields to hospitals. The rest was history.\n\nOne day later, I shipped the laser cut PETG face shields to Jacob. Jacob assembled them and delivered them to hospitals.\n\nAll of this started from a simple question, how can I help? \n\nSo, how can I help? What are you helping with? Let me know in the comments section.\n\n#glowforge #glowforgemade #glowforgecreations #lasercutter #lasercutting #lasercut #lasercutacrylic #faceshield #faceshields #faceshieldcovid19 #essentialmedicalsupplies #designingforhumanity #designforhumanity #covid19 #covid #covid_19 #pandemic #pandemic2020 #essentialworker #helpothers #helpessentialworkers #protectmedicalprofessionals #designforgood #ungstudio #makersgonnamake #makersmovement #makerscovidresponse #makerscovid19","NumberOfLikes":27,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":7,"Timestamp":1598392807,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 26 00:00:07 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"\"HEY!

Today\u2019s stop on my pandemic Hollywood tour is the house that the Lopez family supposedly lived in on the show!\n\n\u201CThe George Lopez Show\u201D house was originally built in 1885, making it the second-oldest home in San Fernando. The idyllic, Victorian, 4-bedroom, single family residence was commissioned by Senator Charles Maclay, a founder of San Fernando, and his wife, Catherine Paxton Maclay.\n\nThe Lopez family home from show is located at \u202A671 Fourth Street in San Fernando\u202C. Thankfully, the property looks much the same in person as it did onscreen, though it has since been painted green. Please note that this is a private residence so if you visit please do not trespass or disturb the people that live there.\n\n\u201CThe George Lopez Show\u201D originally aired for six seasons on ABC from 2002 to 2007. It is currently in syndication on Nick at Nite, and stars the titular comedian George Lopez, who plays a fictionalized version of himself and revolves around his life at work and raising his family at home.\n\nLopez drew much of the material for the show from his own life experiences, especially his upbringing in the San Fernando Valley. Lopez was one of the few Latinos to star in a television comedy series, following in the footsteps of Desi Arnaz, Freddie Prinze, and John Leguizamo.\n\nFun facts - The sitcom would have never existed without Oscar winning actress Sandra Bullock. In 2000, Bullock saw Lopez perform live at the Brea Improv Comedy Club. Bullock had been interested in developing a TV show with a Latino storyline, being concerned about the lack of visibility for Latinos on American television. Bullock approached Lopez backstage after the show and made her pitch to produce and star in a situational comedy centered around the comedian. \n\nFor the first five seasons, the show had an all-Latino cast with the exception of Albanian American actress Masiela Lusha, who played George\u2019s daughter Carmen.\n\nThe character \u201CGeorge Lopez\" was ranked #18 in \"TV Guide\"'s list of the \"50 Greatest TV Dads of All Time\"#filminglocation #thegeorgelopezshow #sanfernando #hollywoodtour #pandemic2020 #socialdistancing #wearamask #tonymiros","NumberOfLikes":32,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1598374016,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 18:46:56 CEST 2020","Location":"San Fernando Valley"},{"CaptionText":"Narrow streets has ways of bringing you closer to beautiful realities üá≤üá¶ \n\u2060\nCool #solotravel üì∏ by @boifromvenus\n\u2060\nFollow & Tag @travsolo on your awesome travel pics for a chance to be featured! ‚úàÔ∏è\u2060\n.\u2060\n.\u2060\n.\u2060\n.\u2060\n.\u2060\n.\u2060\n.\u2060\n#solofemaletraveller #socialdistancingworks #extrovertedintrovert\u2063 #solotraveler #solotravelingisfun #solotraveling #girlstravel #globaltravel #covidtravel #pandemic2020 #pandemictravel #covidtravel2020 #morrocco","NumberOfLikes":36,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Solo Travel Easier on August 25, 2020.

God plants these beautiful desires in our hearts, (unique to each individual) we water them together in hope, prayer & intimacy with Him. Then they grow into bloom in season~ the beauty meant to be shared. It always points back to Him, because it all started with him. We can\u2019t take credit. \n\nThis is the home we\u2019ve been waiting, believing & praying for for nearly 20 years. We felt that without the right timing it wouldn\u2019t have the impact it was meant to, so we waited until we felt a release. \nSpeaking of IMPACT~ December 2019 we stepped out in faith, believing that so much good was coming. It DID. In spite of all that came with Covid~ which included a major loss of income immediately after our down payment. God gave us a gift during a challenging season we never could have anticipated. The joy that came through this process of building was the SWEETEST gift, and it only secures the confidence in my heart that God is kind. Our girls experienced that joy with us & I can\u2019t help but think of all they would have missed out on if the timing was different... even months earlier or later. \nThe reason this carries so much joy for us is because we used to be filled with disappointment for years, and we blamed it unknowingly on God. The past 5 or so years especially we\u2019ve been unlearning some of our negative ideology of God~ that process has been painful, amazing & freeing. Its so easy to associate our past, our pain, our hard experiences with God- yet we needed to learn that God cares so deeply about our past, our pain, and our hard experiences. Before we received this gift, we needed to understand that our blame was misplaced- God has always been a loving Father- it\u2019s our misinterpretation of Him & our lens that has shifted. \nYou\u2019ll have to sit with me here at our house & let me share all the details of God\u2019s goodness with you, b\/c I haven\u2019t even scratched the surface. \nYou are so welcome here ü§ç\n#miraclehome #miracleshappen #beautiful\n#pandemic2020 #homesweethome","NumberOfLikes":91,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":30,"Timestamp":1598363885,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 15:58:05 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"üíÅüèª\u200D‚ôÄÔ∏èüëåüòä‚ù§Ô∏è#pandemic2020  #covid_19","NumberOfLikes":7,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Cinthia Vale on August 25, 2020.

The plan was for my father to come to Mumbai to pick her up.

We were quite worrisome and unhappy knowing my father would have to spend an unforeseeable time by himself. Fortunately the support system in Kolkata helped, Dad did ok by himself.\n\nIn Mumbai, on the other hand, we(including Pluto, Sara and Maple üê∂) were super - duper happy to have Mommy with us for a longer time than her usual visits. üòÄüòÄ\n\nShe too had been enjoying her time with us but (then missing Dad) she would long to go back home to Kolkata.\n\nToday, finally after 6.5 months, I flew with her to Kolkata to drop her home safely ( our first flight ‚úàÔ∏è in the lockdown ). Needless to say I was stressed, given I was travelling with mom and it was a 7 hours flight ‚úàÔ∏è via Jaipur. \nKudos üëè to the staff at @spicejetairlines , @calcuttaairport and Mumbai airport @csmia_official for their tireless efforts in making flying safe during the pandemic. \n\nI am happy to say that we finally made it home üè† safe - Mom was ecstatic to be reunited with Dad !! üòÄüòÄ\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n#lockdownstories #pandemic2020 #covƒ±d19 #staysafe #flyingduringpandemic #lockdownlife #elderlypeople #seniorcitizens #parentsbelike #pandemicpreparedness #lifeduringcovid19","NumberOfLikes":380,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":104,"Timestamp":1598361954,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 15:25:54 CEST 2020","Location":"Kolkata"},{"CaptionText":"\u2063\u2063\nüë©üèª\u200Düè´ ùêìùêöùê† ùêö ùê≠ùêûùêöùêúùê°ùêûùê´ ùê≠ùê°ùêöùê≠ ùêúùê®ùêÆùê•ùêù ùêÆùê¨ùêû ùê≠ùê°ùê¢ùê¨ ùê¢ùêß ùê≠ùê°ùêûùê¢ùê´ ùêõùêöùêúùê§ ùê≠ùê® ùê¨ùêúùê°ùê®ùê®ùê• ùê¨ùêÆùê©ùê©ùê•ùê≤ ùê•ùê¢ùê¨ùê≠. \u2063\n\u2063\nùòûùò¶ ùò§ùò©ùò∞ùò¥ùò¶ #ùêëùêÑùêåùêéùêìùêÑùêãùêÑùêÄùêëùêçùêàùêçùêÜ ùò¥ùò∞ ùòê ùòµùò©ùò™ùòØùò¨ üôãüèª\u200D‚ôÄÔ∏è ùòê ùò§ùò¢ùòØ ùò∂ùò¥ùò¶ ùòµùò©ùò™ùò¥ ùòµùò∞ùò∞. ùòõùò©ùò¢ùòØùò¨ ùò∫ùò∞ùò∂, ùò¥ùò¶ùò≠ùòß.","NumberOfLikes":15,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Christine Orlandella | ONEHOPE in Andover, Massachusetts.","NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598361946,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 15:25:46 CEST 2020","Location":"Andover, Massachusetts"},{"CaptionText":"Wyobra≈∫ sobie, ≈ºe urodzi≈Çe≈õ siƒô w 1900.\nKiedy masz 14 lat, rozpoczyna siƒô I wojna ≈õwiatowa i ko≈Ñczy siƒô kiedy masz 18 z 22 milionami zabitych.\n\nKr√≥tko potem ≈õwiatowa pandemia grypy nazywanej '' hiszpankƒÖ \", zabija 50 milion√≥w ludzi.\n\nWychodzisz ≈ºywy i bez szwanku, ko≈Ñczysz 20 lat.\nW wieku 29 lat prze≈ºywasz ≈õwiatowy kryzys gospodarczy, kt√≥ry zaczƒÖ≈Ç siƒô od upadku nowojorskiej gie≈Çdy, powodujƒÖc inflacjƒô, bezrobocie i g≈Ç√≥d.\n\nMajƒÖc 33 lata nazi≈õci dochodzƒÖ do w≈Çadzy, 6 lat p√≥≈∫niej zaczyna siƒô II wojna ≈õwiatowa.\nGdy masz 45 lat.

You will get stuck and time will pass you by. A few months in this pandemic, I was finding myself semi stuck. I wasn\u2019t looking back but I wasn\u2019t really moving forward either. One day my friend Camille @camille_mcintyre told me about a 10 Day Challenge To Get Unstuck. I didn\u2019t participate in the challenge but I watched her. She challenge herself to interview ladies from all walks of life every Monday. Yes, Monday!!!! Because of her I was inspired to do a Wednesday Bible study once a week. I chose Wednesday because before the pandemic I would do my Women\u2019s Jail Ministry, but the pandemic cancelled it. So, I decided to replace it with a Bible study on Instagram for you ladies and gentlemen. Yes, I have a few faithful gentlemen cheering me on too ladies.\n.\n.\nCamille is so dedicated and devoted to her work in God and on helping us ladies as well. I\u2019m proud to say she\u2019s my inspiration and I\u2019ve found a true friend. I love working with her at The What Lies Beyond event with our friend Doris @dmcushite. By the way, please stop by Doris account, she\u2019s having another event in September. Please register and be blessed again if you attended the first event. Thanks Camille for allowing God to use you to get me unstuck.\n.\n.\nSo remember two things ladies and gentlemen!! Firstly, Forget those toxic things that are behind you and let\u2019s start reaching forth to those great things God have before us. Secondly, remember Lot\u2019s wife. Don\u2019t spirituality or naturally turn to a pillar of salt. Let\u2019s get unstuck and keep moving.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#unstuck #stuck #stuckathome #pandemic #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife #getunstuck #challenge #moveforward #keepgoing #keepmoving #keepmovingforward #timeisnow #timewaitsfornoman #timeispassing #dontlookback #getup #getupandmove #getupandgrind #getupandgo #inspirationalwords #motivational #motivated #motivationforlife #fromthemasterstable #womeninspiringwomen #womensupportwomen #encouragingwords #movingforward #challengeyourself","NumberOfLikes":46,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Delphine Kirkland on August 25, 2020 tagging @victoriadavisgilbert, @camille_mcintyre, @dmcushite, @belovedofmine, @anuonasanya, @imperishable.beauty, @raisingfaithwarriors, @thechurchgirlwrites, @wilmahollislifespeak, and @warriorwomenic.

We hadn't done that in seven years. Our old home had too many trees blocking the night sky. But even seven years ago, the sky looked nothing like the one out here on the mesa. It seemed like there were more stars than there was negative space around them. They receded from bright planets and large twinkling orbs to tiny shiny pinpricks poked through the universe.\n\nThere are two things that happen when I look at the night sky. First, it occurs to me in unquestionable terms that I am a tiny speck of dust, that our planet is a speck of dust, and that I am a speck of dust on a speck of dust. We're just stardust. That's all. All of our concerns about taking up space in the world and how we do it-- how we look in our bodies, how big our house is, how nice our car is, how much money we make, how many friends we have, etc.--is meaningless when you look at the stars. All the stress of the world feels pointless.\n\nSecondly, when I consider that the stars I am looking at burned out billions of years ago, I attempt to wrap my mind around the idea that I am looking at the past, that I am in the future where those stars no longer exist, but I can see them. And I realize that time is irrelevant. Time as we perceive it--the linear, forward moving, one minute follows the next-- is false if we can stare into billions of years in the past in the same moment we take a breath in the present. And I realize that all of our worries about time are meaningless. I'm late. I'm too young. I'm too old. I don't have enough time. I have to meet this deadline. These are all constructs the human mind created to compartmentalize life into small boxes. And by construct, I do mean constrain. Our egos working daily to keep us contained and safe.\nRead more, link in bio...\n.\n.\n.\n#perseidmeteorshower #perseids #perseids2020 #offgrid #strawbalehouse #highdesert #desertlife #stardust #wearestars #quarantinelife #pandemic2020 #shelterinplace #stargazing #timeandspace #mindexpansion #higherconsciousness #writersblog #writerslife #writersofinstagram","NumberOfLikes":23,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Johanna DeBiase in Taos County, New Mexico.

They also provide winter clothing and shoes to people in need, backpacks along with books and stationary to kids before they start school, arrange Qurbani for Bakr Eid for people who can\u2019t afford to buy meat, dress up like Santa and spread happiness during Christmas time, provide ration for poor to fast during Ramadan, run sewing centres in Punjab and Sindh to empower women, provide training for IT for students, short beauty parlour courses for girls, and much much more.\n\nThe team CFFI  believes in serving humanity without judging their race, colour or religon and treating each human as equal and icareity and @hopeabeginning share the same belief! \n\nWe are thrilled to start raising funds for hand pumps in collaboration with team CFFI! The cost of each hand pump installation is $200.

The world is in such a sensitive spot. In many places really. We've got fires breaking out, explosions, volcanoes and so much more. On top of all our normal things we've got a virus that's spread across the world. Isolating us more than ever before. We're social creatures and now some or many of us fear seeing our friends. We're afraid to go to school, the store and so much more.\n.\nA lot of fears are escalated by the news too. The media? Places where we get information? Whatever we wanna call it. The news in my opinion, journalism in my opinion, needs to be objective. It needs to remain as facts. That way it's easier for people to think for themselves, which is something a lot of people seem to have stopped doing. I'm all for fighting for what you believe in, just make sure you know what you're fighting for. Do it in a safe way too. Make sure what you know as facts are facts. The media is so crazy now. \n.\nIt's hard to know what's true and what's not. It's hard to know what's true and what's opinion.

Officially a Certified Life Coach through @jrnicoaching üçæüéä\n\nI made my own grad cap! I opened a fancy bottle of Champagne I was gifted by a friend over a year ago from France (I was saving it for a special occasion)!! AND I gave my OWN dang self a certificate of excellence just for taking this leap (and because it freaking made me feel good)! Because you are allowed to pat yourself on the back. Lift yourself up. Celebrate you! I chose to CELEBRATE this huge accomplishment with every ounce of joy in me! To make a big deal out of it!\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine that only 6 months ago I was hovering over the \u201Cconfirm payment\u201D button. Fully accepting this dream. This path I wanted to be on. This person I wanted to become. Putting my money where my mouth was. Could I actually do this?\n\nSpoiler alert: UH. YA. YA I COULD. AND HELL TO THE YA I DID.\n\nI worked hard. I found a way to pay for it. I showed up every Sunday for 6 months. I worked on myself. I helped others work on themselves. I learned more about who I am. I found my deep purpose on this Earth. There are no words for the utter joy and knowing I have about the next steps in this journey. Cannot wait to continue to share with all my important people üçæüéä\n\nAlso just a huge thank you to life itself for always booting me in the ass when I need it. For giving me the people and the lessons to become more of who I am, and ditch more of who I am not. For always placing exactly what I need, when I need it, within my grasp. I am absolutely SO in love with every part of this thing we call existing üòçüíï\n\n(The real graduate certification will be in end of September y\u2019all, stay tuned ‚úåüèª)\n\n#growth #nobigdeal #bigthings #bigthingscoming #celebrate #celebration #selflove #liftyourselfup #lifecoach #coaching #congrats #personalgrowth #futureceo #highheels #bossbabe #bossbabes #highonlife #bestlife #createyourlife #createyourreality #createyourhappy #createyourself #leapoffaith #hardwork #hardworkpaysoffs #challenges #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":37,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":15,"Timestamp":1598319046,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 03:30:46 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Y ya, ¬øno?

They are on the thinner side, and do not have a pocket for a filter. But, I find that they are very breathable and offer moderate protection.

My handbag is full of gloves and masks and sanitizer and wipes and - you get the picture! I imagine it\u2019s much like carrying a diaper bag - filled with all of the things you might need at any given time ü§¶üèº\u200D‚ôÄÔ∏è. When I do dine out (and not order to-go) to support local restaurants, it\u2019s outside and on a \u201Cslower\u201D day of the week or when the restaurant first opens and always, lunch only. I\u2019ve seen the same friends - always outside, since March 15th and it\u2019s a small handful which makes me miss my entire squad terribly! I\u2019m a hugger and a people person so limited interaction is not natural. Like most of you, I\u2019m typically on the go, so this new pace and normal causes overthinking and anxiety.

Seagull on Thursday accepted the condition recommendation, which is subject to approval by the legislature's Regulations Review Committee.\n\nAccording to the National Pancreas Foundation, the disease causes inflammation of the pancreas that does not heal or improve. The condition only gets worse over time and causes permanent damage, and impairs a patient's ability to digest food and make pancreatic hormones. Roughly 50 of 100,000 people suffer from the disease, which typically develops in patients between ages 30 and 40, and is more common in men than women.\n\nSource: @hartfordbiz #HartfordBiz \n#Connecticut #CT #StateOfCT #Pancreatitis #ChronicCondition #ChronicPancreatitis #MedicalMarijuana #MedicalMarijanaProgram #MedicalCannabis #MedicalCannabisProgram #Marijuana #Cannabis #Medical #Treatment #Suffering #Patients #CTPharma #ChronicPain #AcutePancreatitis #Gallstones #InheritedDisorder  #NationalPancreasFoundation #Disease #DebilitatingConditions #MedicalManagement #Health #COVID19 #Coronavirus #Pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":15,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by CT Vote 2020 in Rocky Hill, Connecticut.

If anything, they're more difficult than they used to be. \nYes the examination period is longer, but again that does not hint to easier examinations.\nLecturers are understanding to a point but assignments\/examinations still occur 1 per week per course and they even require much more time than they previously did. (Well for Math)\n\nSo, no! Online schooling is not 100% better or \"easier\".\n\nHow I got through my last semester:\n\nI prayed every single day, many many many times a day for the strength and will to get through it. There were days where staying in bed felt like all I wanted but those are the days I got up. Motivated myself daily and stayed motivated regardless of how stressful the day was. Then there were days at a time where I was awake for the full 24hrs per day, sometimes only getting in a couple hours of sleep for the week. I even ended up with Insomnia way after the Semester was over. But, like all things, hard work was required.\n\nThe main point of this message being:\nMotivate yourself daily. Stay motivated by setting daily\/weekly\/monthly goals in every aspect of your life. Every morning tell yourself that you are blessed,  beautiful, worthy, loved and capable.\n\n#motivational_quotes #motivationmonday #blogger #trinidadandtobago #trinicontentcreator #influencer #blazin_beauties #brownskingirlwhoblog #motivated #studiesüìö #onlineschooling #pandemic2020 #staymotivatedüí™ #challenges #refined_and_refined","NumberOfLikes":81,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by üóÇ Content Creator in Trinidad and Tobago.
