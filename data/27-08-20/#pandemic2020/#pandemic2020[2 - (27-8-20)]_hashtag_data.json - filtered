[{"CaptionText":"Monday Mantra!\n\nIf you are reading this, Thank the Creator for the opportunity to make it through yet another week of this Covid Pandemic!  The key word for today\u2019s Monday Mantra is PERSEVERE. Choosing to make a lifestyle change  to eat healthier, and exercise is not easy; especially with all the stress of this pandemic.  If your someone like me who has small children at home, your patience and this pandemic is not a good combination. LOL (I laugh to keep from crying) I seriously  had to reflect on the previous week, and I was STRESSED 😫! I was so stressed that I took my focus off of me and the goals that I set for myself. I really let myself down. Nevertheless, I\u2019m so glad that today is a new day, and I\u2019m able to embark on a new week. Life is going to be stressful and challenging,  I have to continue to persevere through it all. So this week, I\u2019m focusing on my Perseverance. How have you persevered through 2020?

The entirety of these funds will be used to provide COVID relief to the people living in the remote Amazon communities of Ayacucho, San Juan de Yanayacu, and Junin Villages. This initiative will provide health and hygiene items such as bleach, soap, and over-the-counter medicines, in addition to foods, such as rice, cooking oil, spaghetti, flour, sugar, oats, potatoes, salt, tea, and canned milk to supplement the crops the people grow and the fish they catch. The generous size of the TWFF contribution will provide enough supplies to last the communities for FOUR months.\n\nWe at the NBHF are immensely grateful and humbled to be selected to receive such a significant donation. We are also deeply appreciative of musical artist and humanitarian Alexi Callinicos and her family for making this possible, as well as of Curassow Amazon Lodge, Grand Amazon Lodge, and Yaku Amazon Lodge & Expeditions for their assistance in the planning and execution of these efforts.

I ordered in a small case of hand sanitizes or what we call at school \"hanitizer\u201D now if I could only get a good left foot (broke mine in a Red Lily Beetle battle . . . guess I lost). I got my \"things\" but am \"I\" ready? I worked at my school library throughout the pandemic with only a handful of people at the school. Schools in a covid-19 pandemic will look different. Not everything has been sorted out, but it will look different. No surprise there- most of 2020 has looked different. We are in this together and we will get through it together. One of my favorite words is HOPE. I've had to rely on hope and prayer throughout the last number of years. Some call,it a mantra and I call it my 'mindful or intentional words'. Here they are \"hope anchors the soul\" It races to my mind when \"worries voices starts chirping\" to silence him. What words\/phrases calm you down, focus your soul, and give your brain a rest?  Take a bit of time and grab some intentional words, they'll be ready when you need them.  School is not going to be the same when we get back. It's going to be better. We are adaptable and resilient folk who will do our best to create teaching moments like we've never had to create before. Our kids (and staff too) need community, need love and caring. They\u2019ll want us to understand that they feel many of the same feelings we do : apprehension, anxiety, uncertainty, but we also know we have the most resilient children too.

Cuando despertó comimos y salimos a jugar en lo que esperábamos a Kuko para ir a caminar, al regresar nos topamos con Cookie, luego nos metimos a la casa a comer algo antes de subir para prepararnos para dormir.\n\n#zoedemicorazon🐥 #recolectandomomentos #staysafeathome #fighting👑🦠 #motherhoodincovid19 #SocialDistancing #FlattentheCurve #stayhomechallenge #stayhomesafelifes #pandemic2020 #quaranteam","NumberOfLikes":5,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598236765,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 24 04:39:25 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Assalamu'alaikum Sahabat Karnus😉\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nWah , sudah H-1 launching produk terbaru dari Tokokarnus nih! \u2063\n\u2063\nTulis tebakan kamu di kolom komentar dan mention 2 Sahabat karnus lainnya untuk menangin 1 box produk terbaru dari Tokokarnus secara gratis lohhh...\u2063\n.\u2063\nJangan lupa menggunakan #BhealthBlife yaaa 😉\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\n\u2022\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\n\u2022\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\nInfo Produk & Cara Penerapan Konsep Karnus\n\n💚 Silahkan Klik link di Bio Instagram @tokokarnus\n💎 Whatsapp Kami di 0899.5721.777\n\u2022\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\n#karnusmedia #konsepkarnus #karnus #pendekarnusantara #tokokarnus #pandemic2020 #lawancorona #liburan #algagold #algatea #beraskarnus #BhealthBlife #localpride","NumberOfLikes":7,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by TOKO KARNUS on August 23, 2020.

This year with your children not having been in school since March, along with how different the upcoming school year is likely to be, their nervousness might be heightened. \u2063\n\u2063\nIt's entirely understandable, but the importance of having them feel comfortable expressing it and having you there to hold their hand and discuss it with them will help to dampen their nervousness.\u2063\n\u2063\nThe weekend provides an excellent opportunity to allow these conversations to occur. Start a chat with your kids about your own back-to-school experiences. Recognizing that you experienced what they might be thinking about, can lead them to share their nervousness while at the same time feeling that they own the conversation.\u2063\n\u2063\nThis will allow you to ease your children's nervousness about the upcoming school year by only using the relaxed setting it offers, along with casually sharing some of your similar experiences. This will allow you to be there for them, while at the same time making it easier for your children to adjust to the school year ahead.\u2063\n.\n\nEnjoy your weekend, ME time is a key component which allows you to be there for your children as you are each day.\n.\n#covid19 #mentalhealth #backtoschool #anxiety #children #parent #counseling #kidsmentalhealth #education #helpingchildren #therapy #stress #backtolearning #acquahcounseling #therapyforkidsandparents #weekendvibes #family #counselingforfamilies #pandemic2020 #pandemicparenting #pandemic #coronavirus #education #wellness #welbeing","NumberOfLikes":13,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Magdalene Acquah on August 21, 2020.

Amidst the current pandemic, this series is relevant as we try to understand what\u2019s happening and look for ways to engage the future. This portrait of Flannery O'Connor, a collector of oddities and visionary, includes symbols of violence she used as a the catalyst for grace, and agents of change -- the bull that gorges and kills, and the fire that both destroys the wood and references the divine. The tattoo man both destructively seeks human connection with the lure of apples, then rejects it. In these uncertain times, I want this series to engage the local community as I explore how nature and a desire for human connection mirror one another, and the part violence and dystopia play to wake us up to reality.\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n#pandemic2020 #pandemicart #flanneryoconnor #flannery #portriatpainting #figurativeart #symbolicart #womenpaintingwomen #womenauthors #texasartist #artspace111 #texasnow #contemporaryrealism #tattooman #viewofthewoods #cleighholderart #artshow #artgallery #originalart #oilpainting #fortworthart #figurativepainting #artcurators #artcollector #poetsartists #southerngothic","NumberOfLikes":62,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":15,"Timestamp":1598213903,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 22:18:23 CEST 2020","Location":"Artspace111"},{"CaptionText":"The cosmos is within us.

In addition, dorms will be reopened with limited capacity and measures such as limited number of guests, social distancing, and mask policies in place. Reopening plans like this have already proven dangerous in other schools around the country, such as UNC-Chapel Hill, among others, which opened for a week before having a large outbreak and subsequent move to all online to prevent further spread. In an attempt to prevent this, UMKC has been doing a back-to-school safety drive to give students kits containing a mask, hand sanitizer, disinfecting wipes, and a card with measures to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. In addition, these tables are being used to hand out Student ID cards, usually handled in an office inside the UMKC Student Union, to help lower the number of people in the Student Union at one time. This has been a new process facilitated by having students email a picture for these cards rather than coming in to the Student Union and having these pictures taken.\n\nThe question of course remains, will this be enough?

The intelligence contains indisputable evidence of the local cover-up attempt, the officials say.\n\nThe reports also say that when the Chinese Communist Party learned about the virus, it sought to obscure the full extent of that knowledge from the rest of the world. They also believe that there came a point where China President Xi Jinping did become aware of the full extent of the outbreak in Wuhan and realised that coronavirus was spreading but continued to downplay the situation publically.\n\nThese findings are on the lines of the Trump administration's repeated accusations against China. The Trump administration has for long looked into the possibility that the novel coronavirus spread from a Chinese laboratory rather than a market, but has presented no proof to back up that theory. \n\nFor more news updates, stay tuned with Socialist-Today.\n\n#covid19 #covid_19 #coronavirus #news #newsupdates #china #wuhan #wuhanchina #pandemic #pandemic2020 #beijing #asia #global #globalpandemic #globalpandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":20,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Socialist Today on August 23, 2020.

Al llegar a casa Zoe quiso comer algo para después alistarnos para dormir.\n\n#zoedemicorazon🐥 #recolectandomomentos #staysafeathome #fighting👑🦠 #motherhoodincovid19 #SocialDistancing #FlattentheCurve #stayhomechallenge #stayhomesafelifes #pandemic2020 #quaranteam","NumberOfLikes":9,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1598154419,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 05:46:59 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"DHHS.gov.au\nGo to this site , have a read. \nYou do not need to disclose you personal medical information . #covidscam","NumberOfLikes":17,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1598153344,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 05:29:04 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"\u201CKu lari ke pantai, kemudian teriakku\nSepi-sepi dan sendiri\nAku benci\n\nAku ingin bingar,\nAku mau di pasar\nBosan Aku dengan penat,\nDan enyah saja kau pekat\nSeperti berjelaga jika Ku sendiri\n\nPecahkan saja gelasnya biar ramai, \nbiar mengaduh sampai gaduh\n\n#2020\n.\n.\n.\n#pandemic2020 #kawasaki #kawasakiw175 #w175 #w175custom #w175indonesia #w175style #w175scrambler #bckyrdcustoms","NumberOfLikes":130,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Adiwarna Irawan on August 22, 2020 tagging @bckyrdcustoms, @thisiskawasaki, @kawasaki_indonesia, @kawasakiw175, @w175style, and @w175bali.

This entire year has both flown by and remained frozen at the same time. This morning I was thinking about how I never in my wildest dreams would think we would have to live our daily lives wearing face masks and living in constant fear. I rarely leave my house anyway,  but there is a difference between it being my choice to stay isolated and being forced to be. For those with debilating mental illness this swift change of life has been even more difficult. \n💊\nBeing dumped by the love of my life of 18 years in 2014, losing my career of 10 years in 2016, losing all the friends that I made there, becoming disabled due to mental illness, a suicide attempt\/hospitalization last October, and then my dad passing away last November after a 2 year battle with cancer has been overwhelming to say the least. I've dealt with all of that, by hiding in my room. The fear of ever getting too close to anyone ever again, is so strong, that I would rather spend the rest of my days alone than ever allow myself to be hurt like that ever again. \n🏡\nI'm lonely sometimes, and wish I still had parties with friends, someone to share my experiences with, or even someplace to go when I need a change of scenery, but my peace of mind is worth more.  Parasocial relationships are the way of the future, I feel safe there.  #summer #dogdaysofsummer #pandemiclife \n.\n.\n.\n.\n#mentalhealth #coronavirus #lifestyle #friendship #loss #cancer #death #fired #divorce #heartbroken #disabled #disability #isolation #Depresion #bipolar #fear #pain #cutslikeaknife #sadness #relationships #familyovereverything #hurt #storytime #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife","NumberOfLikes":6,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1598150808,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 04:46:48 CEST 2020","Location":"Chesterfield County, Virginia"},{"CaptionText":"For everyone days or night #covid19 #friends #family #ordernow #youandme #pandemic2020 $10.00  only  TextNow 😊","NumberOfLikes":6,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1598150752,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 04:45:52 CEST 2020","Location":"Atlanta, Georgia"},{"CaptionText":"Tuhkan.....mbaknya seneng😁😁😘\nTerimakasih sudah mempercayakan kepada kami @keenanfloristmagelang \n🙏🙏🙏\n\nFast respon 081578019011\n\n#magelanghits\n#buketbunga\n#buketbungamagelang\n#buketbungawisuda\n#buketmawarmagelang\n#mawarmerah\n#buketmawar\n#buketwisuda\n#pandemic2020\n#buketbungalamaran\n#engagement\n#lamaran\n#magelang","NumberOfLikes":6,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by karanganbungamagelang on August 22, 2020.

That's one word I would use to describe how I feel as a new mom right now. Covid-19(aka the Rona) robbed us of so much , all the plans we had made to celebrate being parents. Yes gage was born before quarantine, and I'm thankful I was able to have my family(mom husband and sister) with me in the hospital, I was able to have visitors. But since March, everything we planned on, has been ruined. All the firsts I had imagined for my sweet baby...ruined. things we can never get back. His first Easter. There was no family dinners it Easter egg hunt I always plan on my niece and nephew. There were no summer picnics where extended family was able to meet,hold, and love on my baby boy. They have only seen him grow via Skype or pictures shared on social media. There were no weddings where we got to attend and show off our little family and handsome little boy. They were either cancelled or we didn't go. There was a week we spent apart, just the baby and I, after daddy was in a wedding, while we waited for his covid test results to come in before he could home. A week filled with worry because I need to protect my baby and my mom, as well as my whole family. My sweet little one will be robbed of his first Halloween. There will be no trick or treat. I had a cute idea for he and my niece and nephew ...an idea that won't happen. His first Thanksgiving will be ruined, as well as his first Christmas. Yes I have \"traditions\" I can't wait to start with him, things I've dreamed about for years, but he won't get to spend it with family, grandparents, cousins, aunt's,uncle's. And his first birthday. It will most likely, at this rate, be just immediate family and a drive-by or zoom celebration for everyone else, not the big first birthday I imagined. Yes I know he won't remember any of this, but I will. It hurts. Covid robbed us of so much , and as a new mom it breaks my heart. The daily anxiety attacks, Everytime I go to the store or to work. The constant worry \"am I bringing the virus home to my baby? My mom?\". The feeling like my heart is beating through my chest and I can't breathe because of fear. Covid ruined the playdates some mom friends and I planned with our littles","NumberOfLikes":3,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by @mandiemarie12 on August 22, 2020 tagging @motherhoodthroughig, and @bigtimeadulting.

These particles \u201Cshow a more violent climbing tendency. The climbing speed is much faster than toilet flushing,\u201D explained Liu.\n\nSince urinals are more frequently used in densely populated areas, it can pose a serious health challenge.\n\n\u201CWearing a mask should be mandatory within public restrooms during the pandemic, and anti-diffusion improvements are urgently needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19,\u201D Liu added.\n\nEarlier, researchers of fluids at the same university had recommended closing the lid on toilets before flushing to prevent the spread of aerosols. They also recommended washing hands properly with soap after use.\n\n#CoronaVirus #outbreak #publictoilet #toilets #urinal #coronaalert #pandemic2020 #odishabytesnews","NumberOfLikes":5,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Odisha Bytes in Bhubaneswar, India.

Jag har gått i området i många år och idag var mina ögon redo att se den. Jag undrar hur mycket mer jag \u201Dinte ser\u201D trots att det finns framför mig varje dag. Påminner mig om att vi människor vaknar andligt och mentalt i olika tider och på olika sätt. Pandemin har varit en tid för reflektion, att stilla mig i vardagens brus och upptäcka livet på ett nytt sätt. Aldrig har vardagens sysslor gett mig större glädje än nu. Vindens sus i lövträden, regnet som faller och jag får vara torr inomhus, mat att tillaga och äta. Att få sova när sinnet och kroppen är trött. Varje dag är en gåva, jag hade bara glömt det. Så tack för livet och vardagen!\n.\nToday I found it, a new pathway through the raspberry bushes, even thou I have walked by for so many years. Due to, or in my case thanks to the pandemic I have been able to be still in mind and body. Start to appreciate my every day life. My eyes were opened spiritually and mentally to this pathway, in a time when I was ready for it.\nToday I am more grateful for every day chores, for the rain that falls and I can stay at home being dry and warm. To the gentle breeze in the trees and being able to fall asleep when mind and body are tired. Every day is a gift, I had forgotten. Thank you for life and every day life!\n.\n#summer2020 #sommar2020 #pandemic2020 #pandemi2020 #life #grateful #tacksam #gåva #livet #2020년 #여름 #lifeisgood2020","NumberOfLikes":10,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Ledarskap i Norr on August 22, 2020.

Long story short, they've taken secondhand snorkels and created PAPRs (Powered Air Purifying Respirator) - and they're extremely effective! Those interested in the fine print, read on!\n...................\n\nHi Jo and Christey! So we had some key updates on our ventilator project.\n\nBased on demand, supply shortages and our research we adapted the project in a very unique manner. \n\nWe created PAPRs using snorkelling masks which can double as a full face respirator for frontliners which can easily replace their face mask, face shield with this reusable less wasteful and significantly better solution. Additionally the PAPR also doubles up as a ventilator mask which can be retrofitted to any CPAP or BiPAP machine commonly available to provide clean breathing support without having any chance any of the risks of the ambubag type we initially had. \n\nThe design already has FDA emergency approval and is being used around the world. We adopted it in Bangladesh and customized it based on our own needs here. \n\nWe are here and being able to support frontliners like never before because of all the funding we received for you guys. So now our ventilator project doubles up as PPE project for doctors too! We are just too excited to share this amazing news with you guys. \n\nwww.justpeoples.org\/covid-19\n\n#JPprojectleaders #localheroes #localleaders #bestinthefield #supportingthemostvulnerable #covidresponse\n #justpeoples #soimpressive #bangladesh #dogoodfeelgood  #grassroots #projectleader  #givingback #makeadifference #grassrootssolutions #localchange #globalcooperationforsolutions #backinglocalchange #DonatetoSaveLives  #JPCovid19Response \n#3dprinting #snorkel #upcycled #PAPR\n#covid19 #pandemic2020 #flattenthecurve #savelives  #faceshields #PPE","NumberOfLikes":14,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Just Peoples on August 21, 2020.","NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598072454,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 07:00:54 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#pandemic2020 #memelife","NumberOfLikes":1,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Corona Virus Official Memes on August 21, 2020.

Man...what a city and people #cuscoperú is. I flew into Cusco on March 9th for what was supposed  to be a simple 9 day exploration through Lima, Cusco and Machu Picchu with the lady. The pandemic hit Peru March 17.  That 9 day trek has now turned into 164 days and counting. Quarantined in Cusco for 3.5 months of it under martial law. What a freakin  experience and wild ride this has been. Nothing could have prepared me for it! But...it hasn't come without its sacrifices, however. To get where you want to go and preserve your personal integrity and accountability along the way sometimes sacrifices need to be made. Chances need to be taken, and sometimes decisions might not be in your own best interest and that's okay, because that's part of adulting. Putting people ahead of yourself feels good. It's not always about you. Because sometimes being able to sleep at night and being happy when you wake up knowing you made the right decision outweighs everything anyone could ever want when it comes to finding internal peace and happiness. The more you put people ahead of yourself, the more you'll know and feel your self worth. And That I promise you...is priceless! 🤙 #doyoutravel #itravel #travelgoals #adventuretravel #amazingview #thatviewtho #thatviewthough ##globetrotting #jetsetting #solotravels #solotraveller #solotravelstories #pandemic2020 #niceview #iexplore","NumberOfLikes":341,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Marty in Cusco - Peru.
