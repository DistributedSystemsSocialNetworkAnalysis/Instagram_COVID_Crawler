What. a. year. As I\u2019ve been preparing for the fall semester, setting new goals and updating my teaching mission statement, I\u2019ve realized how important it is to distinguish between mid-pandemic goals and modified pre-pandemic goals.\n\nMid-Pandemic Goals:\nGoals that focus on what we can do right here, right now. It\u2019s a perspective shift to look at the current circumstances not as the glass being half full or half empty, but just as being, well, a new glass. It\u2019s approaching challenges with a fresh, expectant perspective, looking for new opportunities, new potential, new purpose.\n\nPre-Pandemic Goals:\nThese are the goals we had set when life was \u201Cnormal\u201D. Naturally we try to modify these goals to fit the current circumstances, but pushing and prodding the goals can ultimately result in smaller, less satisfying, and \u201Ctemporary\u201D versions of the original goals. It\u2019s not only an exhausting process, but it sets us up for disappointment and frustration, and what we may deem as failure.\n\nOf course setting aside prior goals is disappointing\u2014being in the middle of a pandemic is full of disappointments\u2014but by choosing to accept the loss and making a deliberate shift to step into a new chapter, we can confidently walk into this semester with a fresh, refined, and deeply rooted sense of purpose\u2014a purpose specifically for teaching music in the midst of a pandemic.\n\n. . . . .\n\nHow has goal setting looked different for you as you start this new semester?\n\nWhat goals have you been disappointed to set aside? What new goals are you excited to pursue?\n\n. . . . .\n\nThis year IS hard. The fears, uncertainties, and challenges we are facing are. really. hard. But thankfully we\u2019re not alone. In hopes of supporting, encouraging, and inspiring each other, I\u2019ll be sharing experiences and words of wisdom from different teachers in the upcoming weeks. So stay tuned.

The spreadsheet seen above is from November 2019 and my categories have changed slightly since then. Budgeting is adaptable so I\u2019ve made tweaks over time.\n.\n🍇FOOD: Because I wanted to keep it easy for tracking I combine my food and my household items. I usually shop at Walmart so these purchases are combined and on one receipt. I don\u2019t want to deal with separating them when I get home. As a single person it\u2019s easy to add in the occasional toothpaste or dish soap purchase. However, I can see how if you have a family that food and household would need to be separate categories.\n.\n🐶ANIMALS: Pets are expensive and committing to being a good pet owner means you know that going in. I have two cats and a dog that I\u2019m responsible for right now. My animal budget is food for both, litter, flea meds for all, toys, and occasional supplies like brushes. How I manage my animal expenses will be a separate post because there\u2019s a lot to talk about.\n.\n💰SAVINGS: Pretty self explanatory but this is any money that I save into sinking funds or my emergency fund. This is separate from my investments even though some think of it as saving for retirement.\n.\n💸BILLS: This category is large. It\u2019s rent, utilities, car insurance, phone bill, Internet, etc. If I had a mortgage payment then that would go under debt but since I\u2019m a renter, rent is a bill. These are recurring bills that don\u2019t go away and you never pay them off. I\u2019ll probably always have to pay for insurance, phone, and internet.\n.\n🩺MEDICAL\/DENTAL: Again, obvious. I use this to pay for prescriptions, copays, other bills, bloodwork, dental cleanings, dental X-rays, etc. Another example is that I bought a thermometer this month and I put that under medical expenses. \n.\n🚗CAR: I use this for gasoline or car washes. I have a separate sinking fund for car repair and I use that if I need an oil change, new tires, things like that.","NumberOfLikes":9,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Emerald, PA-S on August 21, 2020.","NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598031609,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 19:40:09 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"urban.polymath","CaptionText":"I have finally decided to attempt propagation!

I haven\u2019t been consistent because somebody or some animal is usually in need of ALL OF my time. \nI had to make a sacrifice somewhere because I crave working out.

There is more to me that touches uncomfortably and gets in the way of other things. My body wants to run, wants to move. Wants to feel exerted. \nFarm work and riding and a leisurely bike ride aren\u2019t enough for me, I need that strenuous physical activity. \n\nSo last night instead of cooking a meal from scratch, I let the kids have Mr Noodles.

The dream, moreso a nightmare, paralyses you with fear but is actually a missive for change. The shadows in our lives remind us of the things we must leave behind and the things we must pursue.\n\nSometimes even in the face of immense calamity, there is hardly any change. Just awe, fear, palpitation and a gradual return to the status quo. This could lead to procrastination and postponement of future good.\n\nThe pandemic is really a shadow of our time on earth.

But throughout the pandemic, many communities have struggled to access adequate protective equipment in the face of global shortages. As the need for masks continues to escalate, many are wondering: how can we provide for a global society in which wearing masks has suddenly become as requisite as wearing clothes?\n❤️\nThe solution, in part, is being offered by creative, community-minded individuals around the world who are stepping up to make masks for those in need. These people, many of them volunteers, are supporting relatives, friends, neighbours, frontline workers, and under-resourced groups by transforming the practices of cutting, sewing, and stitching into essential, even life-saving endeavors.

Epic Show ❄️\n\nThe City that never sleeps! 🥰\n\nI live in hope that one day soon we will be able to go back and visit, ideally spending a couple of weeks taking in the Big Apple 🍎 and experiencing more of what this amazing city has to offer.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t feel like that will be for at least 3-5 years with the way this Global Pandemic is going ... and this is so devastatingly sad.\n\nNo matter where you are in the world ... stay safe, stay well, stay connected to people and live in HOPE that we will get through this trying time.\n\n#family #newyork #hope #familyholiday #hopesculpture #NYC #memories #travel #lovenyc #pandemic2020 #covid19","NumberOfLikes":8,"Hashtags":["#family","#newyork","#hope","#familyholiday","#hopesculpture","#NYC","#memories","#travel","#lovenyc","#pandemic2020","#covid19"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Danni Taylor - Find Your Spark on August 20, 2020.

Most people infected will experience a mild to moderate respiratory illness, whilst others will show no symptoms at all. However for some the effects are severe and longer lasting.\n\nTheir aim in this yoga programme is to play some role in aiding the process of recovery. By only requiring the use of mostly basic props and furniture, they have tried to make the poses as accessible as possible for everyone.\n\nThe programme was compiled thanks to advice and guidance from Abhijata Iyengar, Lois Steinberg, Gulnaaz Dashti, Stephanie Quirk, the IY(UK) Therapy Committee, IY(UK) teachers who have experienced the virus themselves, and decades of work by BKS Iyengar and Dr Geeta S. Iyengar in medical classes at RIMYI in Pune.\n\nSee the link in their bio to access the video and booklet, which are both freely available.

In this way, our communities will have access to quality food; one of the most important elements of our culture (agriculture and knowledge of the land) will be recovered, and families will not depend on external markets to have a dignified life,\" says Johanna. \n\"We are confident that this crisis will make us stronger and wiser.

I was a full time premed student working 40-50 hours a week, doing research, volunteering, all the things they tell you to do. It was HARD. I remember using those credit cards for groceries, books, Walmart stuff, gas, the occasional Starbucks, etc. I remember being stretched to my absolute limit of problems I could handle at one time. 😰Because I was young and didn\u2019t know better I stuck my head in the sand and told myself \u201Cjust survive, you\u2019ll figure it out later.\u201D 😓\n. \nWhen I calculated my debt in 2018 and cried in frustration it was because I chose to be in denial back in college. I was not equipped to handle and did not prioritize money the way I should have. Sadly, despite these failures I was still way better off than most of my friends. I saw some really horrible decisions being made but they too had the mentality of \u201Cjust survive, you\u2019ll figure it out later.\u201D 😞\n.\nThat\u2019s sad.

Jury\u2019s still out on this school year but I\u2019m not optimistic! *Link in Bio*\n\n\u201COver the summer my son began saying, \u201CI\u2019m not good at writing.\u201D This presses a tender spot in me. The last time he told me he wasn\u2019t good at writing, I told him I was terrible at writing as a kid too. \u201CReally?\u201D he asked with a surprised look on his face. I told him I kept at it and eventually it got less hard. It would happen for him too, I told him. \u201CWow,\u201D he said almost to himself. \u201CI can\u2019t believe you were bad at writing.\u201D\n\nTruth is I was always good at writing. I\u2019ve been afraid his whole life that he\u2019ll internalize a false story that he is not good because he has a harder time learning certain things or because he operates a bit differently than other kids. The stories we tell ourselves are important, and I don\u2019t want my son stuck inside the lie that he\u2019s not good at something just because he\u2019s not being given the help he needs.\u201D\n.\n#iep #distancelearning #pandemic2020 #pandemicparenting @romper","NumberOfLikes":66,"Hashtags":["#iep","#distancelearning","#pandemic2020","#pandemicparenting"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Minna Dubin on August 20, 2020.

So don\u2019t put your #investment decisions and financial planning on hold just to wait for the situation to become normal.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has brought the world to a standstill. Probably, this is one of the biggest crises in the last 75 years. However, the pandemic is temporary and most of us are going to sail through this tough time.

A crisis like this can keep people out of the job #market for a very long time and also bring unexpected large medical expenditures. We should be prepared for the worst and make the necessary arrangements to make sure we get to live our normal life.\n\nHaving an emergency fund of at least two years of expenditure could give us adequate protection to fight any future unforeseen circumstances. Individuals should keep emergency funds in low-risk and liquid fixed-income #assets.\n\n𝐑𝐞𝐜𝐚𝐥𝐜𝐮𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐢𝐧𝐬𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐧𝐞𝐞𝐝𝐬\n\nA good health #insurance plan is a must for all. If it\u2019s family insurance then coverage definitely needs to be higher than Rs 5 lakh. Investors should consider having low-cost top-up insurance to increase the coverage amount. Further, adequate term insurance for the main earning member of the family is necessary.\n\n𝐑𝐞𝐯𝐢𝐬𝐢𝐭 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐟𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐠𝐨𝐚𝐥𝐬\n\nTraveling and large social gatherings are two things that are stopped due to this crisis.

Then the process repeats itself.\n\nSome days I forget to weed the flower garden, check the mailbox, and water the topiary trees on the front porch.\n\nSome days I forget to schedule Cooper for a groom, only remembering when his wiry coat is thick and matted.\n\nSome days I forget to eat lunch.\n\nSome days I forget to say please and thank you.\n\nSome days I forget to say no.\n\nAnd some days...some days...I forget I had cancer.\n. \n.\n.\n#thewritinglife #cancerwarrior #basilflowers #basilbombs #thaibasil #pandemic2020 #poetry #pandemicpoem #changeyourmindset #motivation101 #pivot #writingcommunity #writerslife #authorssupportingauthors #publishing #amwriting #authorsofig #writerscommunity #ilovewriting #instawriter #healthy_lifestyle #healthyliving #bookstagram #memoir","NumberOfLikes":22,"Hashtags":["#thewritinglife","#cancerwarrior","#basilflowers","#basilbombs","#thaibasil","#pandemic2020","#poetry","#pandemicpoem","#changeyourmindset","#motivation101","#pivot","#writingcommunity","#writerslife","#authorssupportingauthors","#publishing","#amwriting","#authorsofig","#writerscommunity","#ilovewriting","#instawriter","#healthy_lifestyle","#healthyliving","#bookstagram","#memoir"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Maureen C.

It is extremely relevant today for obvious reasons. In this video you will see a company in Georgia situated near train tracks with acres and acres of plastic Fema Coffins. I literally just read today that Georgia is in the red zone with one of the highest rates of covid and covid deaths. Coincidence??? 11 years ago it was suspected that there were at least 2 million coffins stockpiled. Anyone care to guess how many coffins they have stockpiled right now? \n\nFastforward a decade and we conveniently have a plandemic killing citizens in record numbers. Plandemic meaning planned scheduled intentional creation & release of a biological weapon worldwide!  Let us not forget all of the other biological weapons we have been exposed to; anthrax, SARs Swine Flu & Ebola to name a few. Each outbreak did its part to decrease the population & generate fear. \n\n.\n\nDid they ever give an official explanation what these coffins are for?\n\n.\n\nRemember about 6 years ago when Walmart stores were closing all over the country? There was speculation that these Walmarts were being turned into FEMA camps. I often joke that Walmart is an extension of the government. Now we have massive business closings & people are losing their homes. We're experiencing the beginnings of a concocted food shortage while fighting a biological war.

Most people infected will experience a mild to moderate respiratory illness, whilst others will show no symptoms at all. However for some the effects are severe and longer lasting.\n\nOur aim in this yoga programme is to play some role in aiding the process of recovery. By only requiring the use of mostly basic props and furniture, we have tried to make the poses as accessible as possible for everyone.\n\nThe programme was compiled thanks to advice and guidance from Abhijata Iyengar, Lois Steinberg, Gulnaaz Dashti, Stephanie Quirk, the IY(UK) Therapy Committee, IY(UK) teachers who have experienced the virus themselves, and decades of work by BKS Iyengar and Dr Geeta S. Iyengar in medical classes at RIMYI in Pune.\n\nSee the link in our bio to access the video and booklet, which are both freely available. Please consider donating a contribution towards this and future Iyengar yoga therapy resources 🙏\n\nThanks to all involved in creating the programme and to @adrienne_karmaspaceyoga for designing the e-book\n\n#iyengaryoga #yogatherapy #covid19 #covid_19 #coronavirus #recovery #covidhelp #yogaforhealing #yoga #mypandemicsurvivalplan #sarscov2 #pandemic #pandemic2020 #staysafe #virus #postcovid #yogapractice #loveyoga #yogateachers  #iyengarmethod #yogadaily #practiceyoga #yogisofinstagram #yogajourney","NumberOfLikes":3,"Hashtags":["#Repost","#iyengaryoga","#yogatherapy","#covid19","#covid_19","#coronavirus","#recovery","#covidhelp","#yogaforhealing","#yoga","#mypandemicsurvivalplan","#sarscov2","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#staysafe","#virus","#postcovid","#yogapractice","#loveyoga","#yogateachers","#iyengarmethod","#yogadaily","#practiceyoga","#yogisofinstagram","#yogajourney"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by #learniyengar on August 19, 2020.

It appears though that Kamath has not blamed anyone in his suicide note, sources said.\n\nKamath was found dead in the bathtub. It was said that the artist was under stress since a long period of time and the coronavirus lockdown made it worse for him.\n\nKamath lived with his mother in his Mumbai apartment. He was a photographer as well apart from an artist. In fact, his glasswork paintings were popular in the Mumbai art circuit. He was also a mythologist known for his Indian Calendar art and used to call himself Mahalaxmi's favourite child.\n\n..\n\n#artist #ramindranilkamath #photographer #painting #Mumbai #artcircuit #mythologist #coronovirus #lockdown #pandemic2020 #covid19 #depressed #stress #mumbaipolice","NumberOfLikes":6,"Hashtags":["#artist","#ramindranilkamath","#photographer","#painting","#Mumbai","#artcircuit","#mythologist","#coronovirus","#lockdown","#pandemic2020","#covid19","#depressed","#stress","#mumbaipolice"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by NewsDiary on August 19, 2020.

In this case, things are scary, unknown, frustrating, sad etc etc etc. But despite everything going on around the world, within my own home, I have found peace. I found the opportunity to create, fix, relax, enjoy etc etc etc. I don't feel quite as spread thin with a packed schedule.

I have enjoyed riding my bike with the kids and going to the beach (we take living in Hawaii for granted sometimes) I appreciate the extra help around the house that the littles didn't have time for before with hula, baseball, church, school. I've also enjoyed the extra time to just be lazy.

A delightful way to start the day.\n.\nThis was the fuel-up breakfast I made for my kids and I this morning before we went canoeing together for the first time. It was filling and satisfying.\n.\nAnd the whole experience was awesome. I loved canoeing with my kids \u2014 so. Much. Fun.\n.\nThis summer hasn\u2019t been the one I envisioned. Our usual beach trips and family visits were cancelled. There have been no camps, no musical production for my daughter and no cross country team practices for my son. \n.\nBut that\u2019s just what didn\u2019t happen. It doesn\u2019t tell the story of what did happen. We\u2019ve hiked, biked, explored, swam and canoed. We\u2019ve spent so much time together too \u2014 not just doing things by cooking, cleaning and enjoying our space.\n.\nThis is a hard time \u2014 a time when we have had to weigh our desires for normalcy and plans against our need to stay healthy. But even though it\u2019s hard, unexpected and unusual, it\u2019s also made many bright moments.\n.\nThose are the ones I will choose to remember. Years from now, when people ask, I will say that we masked up and practiced social distancing, we wore masks and canceled trips. But I will say that despite the hardship, it was a good time. It brought my kids and I closer together.

Being vulnerable on the internet is scary, but I have to get this off my chest. I like to keep things light and encouraging on here, but sometimes you just have to get in the trenches and talk it out. Starting a business in the middle of a pandemic is hard. On the business side, trying to figure out how build things from the ground up, make sure I'm adhering to state regulations, learning marketing, branding, social media. It's a lot. On the mental and emotional side there's trying to find locations that don't have a lot of people, knowing that right now people are struggling and not wanting to spend money, trying to make connections with people when creating connections right now is hard. It's exhausting. Add all the in between real life things- Homeschooling my littles, my college courses, responsibilities as a wife and stay at home mom, all the unrest in the world right now, watching my friends and family have to make difficult decisions. It's a lot! Some days I really struggle to keep it all together and thing running smoothly.\n\u2022\n\u2022\n So this is what it looks like. No fancy office with great natural light. No Pinterest worthy spaces. Just hiding in my room trying to get some work done. Leggings, no makeup, a messy bun because I'm 30 and still can't figure out how to do my hair.\n\u2022\n\u2022\nI don't say all of this to sound like I'm complaining. One thing I've learned is that if I feel a certain type of way, chances are someone else does too. Is that you? Are you struggling with 2020 and all that it's brought? I need you to know that you're not alone. You're not crazy, and you're not dumb for feeling like this. This is hard stuff we're going through. \n\u2022\n\u2022\nMy DMs are always open if you need to vent or cry or just want to say hey, me too. I want this space to be somewhere that you can be yourself and connect with other people, too! \n\u2022\n\u2022\nIf you can relate to any of this, drop a comment and let me know.

I feel like this has been the motto for my life, mostly because it\u2019s had to be. I\u2019ve been put through the motha fuckin RINGER and if I didn\u2019t have this mentality I totally would have crumbled by now. I\u2019ve been thinking about this quote a lot the last few days. If you watch my stories than you know that I am in a terrible situation when it comes to housing right now. Due to the pandemic we have to move like immediately, we didn\u2019t get approved for the loan to buy the house since the landlord wants to sell, and the rental market is terrible. I had a mini breakdown yesterday. I started thinking about how I ALWAYS do everything by the book and things just don\u2019t work out for me. When you are trying to break cycles of poverty, addiction, homelessness, it\u2019s not as easy as \u201Cwork hard and you will succeed\u201D. I\u2019ve spent my entire life working as hard as I can, getting all straight a\u2019s, working multiple jobs, and still I always fall short because of something from my past. Both of my parents have passed away, so I don\u2019t have anyone to help me co-sign for loans, or lend me a few dollars if I need it, or teach me how to build credit or apply for a mortgage. My mom let her addiction get the best of her and she started me off with terrible credit when I turned 18 by using my SSN to sign up for cards, gas and electric.. the list goes on. I\u2019ve been trying to work off the disadvantages growing up in extreme poverty with addict parents my entire life.. and it\u2019s fucking hard. My life has been full of struggles, unbelievable stories, things you only see in the movies.. and I could have let it ruin me. But I just let it fuel my fire. Some days I just want to throw in the towel, but then I think about what I\u2019ve already been able to survive. You can get through ANYTHING with hope. It\u2019s not as easy as \u201Cworking hard\u201D, and it won\u2019t always be a straight path, but if you never give up on yourself, I promise you it will just make you more and more unbreakable every single time.

So lets have a look at why we are having such a reaction & what we can do to limit some of the damage!\n ✨\nThe biggest issue with face masks is the condensation from our breath. This condensation creates a warm & moist environment; leading to blocked pores, bacteria growth and irritation. Inflammatory conditions such as Dermatitis, Psoriasis, Acne & Rosacea are irritated & flare ups are common. The tightness of the face coverings also create friction, rashes & in some instances, hives. One of the biggest issues of this new micro-climate is that it causes the skin to sweat more, whilst the masks simultaneously absorb the skins natural oils. Thus leaving our skin dry, producing excess sebum & sore\/flaky.\n ✨\nIf you are not a frontline (Healthcare) worker, then always use face coverings made from a breathable fabric (stay far away from synthetics), wash it regularly & try to limit any make up worn. TLC is paramount, so make sure you are supplying adequate hydration & then locking this in with an emollient \u2013 reapplication may be required multiple times throughout the day. The right facial oil may also be beneficial at this time to sooth certain conditions, keep the skin flexible & limit irritation. Also try to limit known skin irritants if you will be wearing a mask directly afterwards eg, acids, retinol, fragrance, tea tree\/witch hazel.\n✨\n#pandemic2020 #pandemic #facemasks #facemaskselfie #skinproblems #skinproblemsolution #healthcareworkers #healthcareheroes #ppe #skin #skincare #skincaretips #skinspecialist #acne #acnetreatment #dermatitis #eczema #sensitiveskin #cheltenham #cheltenhamlife #cheltenhamwomeninbusiness #cotswolds #cotswold #cotswoldlife #gloucestershire","NumberOfLikes":28,"Hashtags":["#pandemic2020","#pandemic","#facemasks","#facemaskselfie","#skinproblems","#skinproblemsolution","#healthcareworkers","#healthcareheroes","#ppe","#skin","#skincare","#skincaretips","#skinspecialist","#acne","#acnetreatment","#dermatitis","#eczema","#sensitiveskin","#cheltenham","#cheltenhamlife","#cheltenhamwomeninbusiness","#cotswolds","#cotswold","#cotswoldlife","#gloucestershire"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Advanced Skin Cheltenham in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.

Drone inspections are more thorough- with a drone we can observe all those difficult-to-access places. The roof of the home can have a plethora of nooks and crannies, and without a drone it\u2019s hard to see some of the finer details. \n\n2. Drone inspections are more efficient- the drones ability to fly allows it to cover a broader area more quickly than a person with a ladder navigating steep slopes. \n\n3. Drones can provide an aerial overview of the property- this can come in handy for properties that come with a vast amount of acres and out buildings. This way you can see the condition of the buildings from above, the landscape features, placement of trees and shrubs and neighbors. \n\nNeed an inspection on a roof our ladders can\u2019t reach?

As the story goes, the barracks used to give dances or something like that. Then in comes my mom \u2014 beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. His face lit up when he saw her. \n\nWhen the war ended, my dad came back to Chicago. My grandma, his mother, owned a lot of property on the South Side. So my Dad sent for my mom and they came and lived in an apartment in my grandma\u2019s building. They bought their first home in 1955 in Englewood.\n\nMy mother was the type of woman \u2014 she didn\u2019t wait for my father to bring home the paycheck. My mother said, \u2018Wait one minute. If something happens to your dad, then what will I do? I\u2019m going to get out there and work too.\u2019 \n\nShe was a great wife. My father might have been the man of the house but my mother was the boss. And she taught my sister and I what it meant to be a woman \u2014 not just a woman, but a Black woman.

I can\u2019t imagine how time flies. There are so many pros (and cons of course - I miss my friends at @spigotinc so much ❤️) about being at home - Here are the highlights: \n🌟I returned back to work from my maternity leave after 6 weeks. That was tough leaving a 6 weeks baby at home and go back straight to work. Now, I\u2019m getting the chance to see Jon-Jon grow in front of my eyes, and I feel so grateful for every min I spend with him 🙏🙏.\n🌟I got a chance to change my lifestyle - do more exercises and lose all the weight I gained from pregnancy (I couldn\u2019t stop eating) 🥗🏃\u200D♀️. \n🌟I feel much more relaxed and much peaceful. Anyone who sees me these days will notice the difference (thanks to the Pilates) 🧘\u200D♀️. \n🌟I got the chance to spend much much more time with hubby and strengthen our family unit. Believe me this time is so precious 👨\u200D👩\u200D👦. \n🌟And last but not least, I learned to wake up every morning and say Thank You for everything I have in life.
