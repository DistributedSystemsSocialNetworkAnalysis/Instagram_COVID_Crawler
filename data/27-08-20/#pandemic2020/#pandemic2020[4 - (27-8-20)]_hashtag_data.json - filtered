We should be prepared for the worst and make the necessary arrangements to make sure we get to live our normal life.\n\nHaving an emergency fund of at least two years of expenditure could give us adequate protection to fight any future unforeseen circumstances.

Even during \u201Cnormal\u201D times it can be hard to manage. So the idea of jumping back into it under these crazy new circumstances was totally overwhelming! \n\nIn order to curb my anxiety, I came up with a few coping strategies:\n\n1Ô∏è\u20E3 One route at a time \n\nIt was much less stressful for me to imagine starting back out on the road with a short trip to a set destination, rather than simply jumping back into an ongoing way of life. \n\nIn other words, in order to relaunch I needed to know I was heading toward another safe harbor. I wanted a specific vision to look forward to if things got tough in between. \n\nOnce we got to our first destination, we could plan another route, and another one after that, and so on and so on . . . but I needed to approach it in increments. \n\n2Ô∏è\u20E3 Be ready to be flexible \n\nI reminded myself to let go of all expectations and try to take things as they come. To set plans in jello, and have plenty of back-up ideas. \n\nIf a location didn\u2019t feel right or wasn\u2019t comfortable for us for any reason - we could always just move right along, or even re-route entirely! \n\nThat\u2019s the beauty of traveling WITH your home. \n\n3Ô∏è\u20E3 Go easy on ourselves \n\nThis wasn\u2019t the time to push ourselves; it was the time to err on the side of caution. \n\nAlso my mantra: keep everything as SIMPLE as possible. \n\nThings are going to be challenging enough just trying to keep three kids under five socially distanced from other people while traveling (and keep them from sticking random things in their mouths, among other non-virus-friendly habits). \n\nAnother pep-talk I gave us: Just do what we can, and don\u2019t stress about what we can\u2019t! \n\nüíô‚ù§Ô∏èüíö\n\nDid any of you all get off the road in order to lock down for a bit, and if so are you back on now? \n\nWhat were\/are some of YOUR on-the-road-during-a-pandemic strategies?","NumberOfLikes":238,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Three Little Trees in Home Sweet Home.

Let me explain the picture on this post. For the moment I live in South Korea (no Im not Korean) , this picture was taken at my local gym on August 19th. On the left side of the pic we have a column that depicts a person that is infected with Covid-19. On the right side we have a peson that is not infected with Covid-19. Now according to this propaganda piece of laminated paper, if you and the infected person are wearing a mask the possibility of infection is 1.5%. If the infected and the none infected are not wearing a mask then the possibility of infection is 100%. Now I dont know if any of you remember this but around 5 months ago the WHO was against wearing a mask and even said that wearing a mask doesn't protect you from the virus. They were right but as soon as Trump dropped financial aid support for the WHO , they sided with communist China and changed their mindset regarding the mask. The mask doesn't protect you from shit, that is the point of this posting. It only slowly poisons your lungs by breathing your own C02. The mask is only a symbol of communist compliance to the government, that is the only purpose for it. \n\nNow for my fellow Koreans, please wake up! Stop believing the mainstream news, stop watching your apps about infected people, those numbers are fake most of the time. Even if you die from a heart attack some hospitals are labeling the cause of death as Covid-19 in order to get funding. Stop trusting your government, they are best friends with communist China and have no interest in fixing this situation at all other than continuing on inposing this stupid rules. Yeah Korea is safe from the chaos in the West, but nothing last forever and soon Korea will fall into civil unrest...people can only take so much before they explode and decide that enough is fucking enough!! The mask is a symbol of communism plain and simple. That is all.\n\n#control #covid19sucks #billgatescoronavirus #billgates #drfauci #drfauciisafraud #pandemic2020 #covid_19 #fake #bullshit #hiddenagenda #science #commonsense #stop #mask #fuckmask #lies #2020corruption #hydroxychloroquine #doctorsfortruth #cure #vaccine #endtimes #Zionist","NumberOfLikes":12,"Hashtags":["#control","#covid19sucks","#billgatescoronavirus","#billgates","#drfauci","#drfauciisafraud","#pandemic2020","#covid_19","#fake","#bullshit","#hiddenagenda","#science","#commonsense","#stop","#mask","#fuckmask","#lies","#2020corruption","#hydroxychloroquine","#doctorsfortruth","#cure","#vaccine","#endtimes","#Zionist"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The Collector ‚ò† in Seoul, Korea.

The production team copied the interior of the house, including the spiral staircase, almost exactly on a soundstage at Paramount.\n\nPlease note that this is a private residence so if you visit please do not trespass or disturb the people that live there.\n\nConsidered to be one of the greatest movies of all time, the film stars Fred MacMurray as an insurance salesman, Barbara Stanwyck as a provocative housewife who wishes her husband were dead, and Edward G. Robinson as a claims adjuster whose job is to find phony claims. The term \"double indemnity\" refers to a clause in certain life insurance policies that doubles the payout in rare cases when the death is accidental, such as falling off a train.\n\nPraised by many critics when first released, \u201CDouble Indemnity\u201D was nominated for seven Academy Awards but did not win any. Widely regarded as a classic, it often is cited as having set the standard for film noir.\n\nFun facts - The blonde wig that Barbara Stanwyck is wearing throughout the movie was the idea of Billy Wilder. A month into shooting Wilder suddenly realized how bad it looked, but by then it was too late to re-shoot the earlier scenes. To rationalize this mistake, in later interviews Wilder claimed that the bad-looking wig was intentional.\n\nBilly Wilder and Raymond Chandler did not get along whilst writing the script, a process that was apparently filled with  on-stop arguments. #filminglocation #doubleindemnity #beachwoodcanyon #hollywoodtour #pandemic2020 #socialdistancing #wearamask #tonymiros","NumberOfLikes":73,"Hashtags":["#filminglocation","#doubleindemnity","#beachwoodcanyon","#hollywoodtour","#pandemic2020","#socialdistancing","#wearamask","#tonymiros"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":40,"Timestamp":1597772813,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 18 19:46:53 CEST 2020","Location":"Beachwood Canyon, Los Angeles"},{"Owner":"_prettyslick_","CaptionText":"One leg at a time . . . \n.\n.\n.\nIt\u2019s easy to get off track at these times.

I didn't really get any with my first, I think I counted five total! Harrumph. Grrrrazzzlemrafrazzle.\nI keep forgetting to replenish my stock of Gaviscon dual action tablets. Yay for the glamour of pregnancy. \n\nHusband did an epic amount of housework today; the 5yo snapped this pic of bump while she and I took a walk to the village to be out of the way.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#thirdtrimester #thirdtrimesterproblems #28weekspregnant #stretchmarks #heartburn #babybrain #mypregnancyjourney #babyboy #novemberbaby #summerpregnancy #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":39,"Hashtags":["#thirdtrimester","#thirdtrimesterproblems","#28weekspregnant","#stretchmarks","#heartburn","#babybrain","#mypregnancyjourney","#babyboy","#novemberbaby","#summerpregnancy","#pandemic2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @pregnancyrevisited on August 17, 2020.

How are you and your children feeling about going back?\u2060\n.\u2060\nWhen I sent Little Man back to nursery in July I was so worried. Was it safe? Would the changes they'd made freak him out? Would he be happy? How would he adapt after so long at home? Would he get upset going back? Was I being selfish sending him back so I could work? Should I just keep him at home with me? So many questions running through my mind, and so much time spent weighing up the pros and cons. So I understand how it must feel (for both you and your children) now you're preparing to send your children back to school after 5 months at home under such weird circumstances. \u2060\n.\u2060\nThat's why I'm offering 10% off my entire hug range from now until the end of the month, including these squishy hug buttons. Hug Buttons were invented by a mum as a way of comforting her child who was anxious about starting school. She drew a heart on her hand, and a heart on the hand of her son and if he felt lonely or sad whilst at school he could 'press' the button which would then send a hug! These squishy hugs offer a physical form of comfort for children who may be missing a loved one whilst at school, nursery or while their loved one is at work. To take advantage of the offer simply head to my Etsy shop (the link is in my bio). You don't need any codes, the discount is applied automatically. \u2060\n. \u2060\nOh and Little Man absolutely loved being back at nursery. He's completely flourished since he's been back and comes home every day he's there full of everything he's done and who he's played with. I think the transition back was harder for me than him! \u2060\n.\u2060\n#backtoschool #backtoschool2020 #schoolsreopening #endoflockdown #lockdown2020 #socialdistancing #transitionphase #backtonormality #thenewnormal #pandemic2020 #hugbuttons #handmadehugs #backtoschooloffer #handmadecomforts #snugglehugs #hugbuddy #cuddlytoy #pockethug #parentingthroughapandemic #thisisparenthood #shopsmall #shoplocal #summerholidays #schoolprep #etsyuk #etsyseller #etsyshop #discount #salenowon #shopnow\u2060","NumberOfLikes":18,"Hashtags":["#backtoschool","#backtoschool2020","#schoolsreopening","#endoflockdown","#lockdown2020","#socialdistancing","#transitionphase","#backtonormality","#thenewnormal","#pandemic2020","#hugbuttons","#handmadehugs","#backtoschooloffer","#handmadecomforts","#snugglehugs","#hugbuddy","#cuddlytoy","#pockethug","#parentingthroughapandemic","#thisisparenthood","#shopsmall","#shoplocal","#summerholidays","#schoolprep","#etsyuk","#etsyseller","#etsyshop","#discount","#salenowon","#shopnow\u2060"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Handmade Unique Toys in Newcastle upon Tyne.

This year has taken the world by storm, fire and water quite literally. Some things aren\u2019t within our control and that\u2019s really mostly all of 2020.\n.\nHowever, there is so much that we still are capable of and that is where I believe we underestimate ourselves. To be part of the world that struggles and yet revives, to stand up a little stronger, cling on to hope a little tighter and hold on to faith a little deeper. To go all out and donate generously, empathise passionately and help fervently. To believe there is one overlooking all of this despair and absolutely nothing happens without his knowledge. That no matter how bad it gets, you will get through this , for no soul shall be burdened more than he can bear.\n.\nLook at the glorious skies and enwrap yourself with the beauty of this world. Soak yourself in the warmth of the horizon for it does leave you with a sense of gratitude, hope and faith.\nWhile we wake up each day to something that breaks our heart yet again, know that there are also stories of joy and happiness witnessing that very moment. And for every heartbreak, we have a little something we can offer to the world.

I know online classes can be challenging for some, but now is the time to put your practice into action. Don\u2019t let your mind get in the way of consistent practice & focus on all the reasons that in person classes are better. This internal practice allows us to observe our own mind, ego, thoughts and desires. I may have a desire to be doing yoga in public groups, but I know I\u2019m causing less harm by practicing\/teaching online. The conditions do not need to be \u201Cjust right\u201D for me to go inward, observe, reflect, contemplate & refine the way that I move, speak, think & act in this world. In fact, they usually are not & this is part of the practice. I don\u2019t need a ocean view, large group, or killer playlist (all very nice) to practice. Yoga teaches us not to be attached to the way things were or to how we want them to be. How can I be happy or content if I\u2019m always wishing things were different from what they are? Consistent practice gives us the wisdom & resiliency to accept & adapt to circumstances outside of our control, & the strength to act on circumstances within our control. We are fortunate to have the guidance of our yoga teachers who are busting their ass to recreate a \u201Cstudio\u201D experience & keep everyone connected & inspired, even though we are apart. Shout out to all the yoga teachers who continue to offer live online classes & to all of you who continue to practice with us @sukhayogavt @noahyogabroker. We are grateful!

There was little reason to go, most places were closed, my school, ICP, moved from 43rd Street and 6th Avenue, to the Lower East Side and has been closed ever since, and I\u2019ve been reluctant to travel by subway. But my Leica M-4 needed repair, and the shop that I\u2019ve used for years, Nippon Camera Repair (the best in the city), is located just west of 5th Avenue on West 39th Street. So, I took two slow moving buses from the Upper West Side to the shop. Midtown is strange and eerie, if not a bit scary, even midday. Many many stores are still closed, some are boarded up. There are more mannequins in store windows then people on the streets. Emptiness prevails. Bryant Park is relatively peopleless. The few beings around are mostly wearing masks, some are in dark face shields. Traffic is very light, you can jaywalk at will. All this still, five months after the virus struck New York City devastatingly hard. New York is handling the pandemic, as we handle most things. With time, we will survive, but life should be about more than surviving. #icpconcerned #covidstoriesnyc #coronadays #coronadiaries #socialdistancing #coronavirus #wsp_covid19 #socialdistancing #covid_19photography #thenewnormal #alonetogether #coronavirusnyc #faceshield #pandemic2020 #massisolationaus #massisolationformat #fifthavenuenyc #sixfeetapart #burnmagazine #capturedmoments #eyeshotmag #etczine #nytimes #huffingtonpost #streetwalking #streetphotography #streetphotomag #streets-storytelling #storyofthestreets #instagramhub ¬©Harvey Stein 2020","NumberOfLikes":133,"Hashtags":["#icpconcerned","#covidstoriesnyc","#coronadays","#coronadiaries","#socialdistancing","#coronavirus","#wsp_covid19","#socialdistancing","#covid_19photography","#thenewnormal","#alonetogether","#coronavirusnyc","#faceshield","#pandemic2020","#massisolationaus","#massisolationformat","#fifthavenuenyc","#sixfeetapart","#burnmagazine","#capturedmoments","#eyeshotmag","#etczine","#nytimes","#huffingtonpost","#streetwalking","#streetphotography","#streetphotomag","#streets-storytelling","#storyofthestreets","#instagramhub"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Harvey Stein in Fifth Avenue NYC.

What surprised me was that @austrianairlines staff didn\u2019t think of moving some people from the rows that were full into those that were empty to allow social distancing. They also didn\u2019t tell the person who wore the mask bellow the nose (initially he wore it below the chin, but I asked him to put it on) to wear it correctly, like some other companies do. I think air companies should do more for the safety of passengers, but still, it was nice to fly again, see the clouds below and the cn lights of Vienna at the arrival.
