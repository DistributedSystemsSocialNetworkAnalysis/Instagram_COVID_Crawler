[{"CaptionText":"Dirgahayu ke 75 Negeriku... Jayalah selalu Indonesiaku... MERDEKA🇮🇩\nDi masa kemerdekaan ini, banyak yang bertanya, masih bebas kah mengemukakan pendapat? Apalagi kasus 'memenjarakan' salah satu artis karena bicara melecehkan. Kena pasalnya juga UU ITE.\nSebenarnya kami tidak memenjarakan bliau karena melecehkan, kami dokter kebanyakan juga tidak mengerti UU ITE (boleh deh di survey, paling cuma sedikit yg tahu). Kami melaporkan bliau, karena gerakan menolak masker... coba kalau benar banyak pengikut bliau yg menerapkan tdk pakai masker, maka virus ini akan makin menyebar. Saat ini saja kapasitas rumah sakit tdk mencukupi. \nBeliau juga menolak rapid... coba logika saja, maukah kalian tertular dari seseorang, karena status penyakitnya tidak diketahui. Kemudian menularkan ke keluarga anda? Dimana rasa sayang anda pada keluarga anda di rumah?\nMari sama sama pahami esensinya. \nKami tak pernah melarang kalian memasang baliho, tapi coba dipikirkan, apakah ditengah pandemi seperti ini kalian mau berkumpul dengan orang yg status penyakitnya tidak kalian ketahui? Ingat orang tanpa gejala ada dimana mana. \nKenapa anda tidak sakit sampai sekarang? Saya cuma bisa menjawab, anda sedang beruntung di lindungi Tuhan anda. Maka bersyukurlah🙏\n#independenceday #17agustus #pandemic2020 #saveindonesia #kitabersaudara #usaimenghujat #merdeka #indonesiandoctor #indonesiabodybuilder","NumberOfLikes":126,"Hashtags":["#independenceday","#17agustus","#pandemic2020","#saveindonesia","#kitabersaudara","#usaimenghujat","#merdeka","#indonesiandoctor","#indonesiabodybuilder"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by cokorda a wahyu in RS.PTN UNUD.","NumberOfComments":6,"Timestamp":1597629001,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 03:50:01 CEST 2020","Location":"RS.PTN UNUD"},{"CaptionText":"누군가,\n2020년이\n꿈일 뿐이라고\n말해주면 좋겠다\n\n#abouttime #aboutus #whereis2020 #unreal2020 #unbelievable2020 #pandemic #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife #cantusedtoit #stayhome #staysafe #stayhealthy #stayhappy #endofsummervacation #backtoschool #family #familytime #familyfirst #familyiseverything #losangeles #california #daily","NumberOfLikes":120,"Hashtags":["#abouttime","#aboutus","#whereis2020","#unreal2020","#unbelievable2020","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#pandemiclife","#cantusedtoit","#stayhome","#staysafe","#stayhealthy","#stayhappy","#endofsummervacation","#backtoschool","#family","#familytime","#familyfirst","#familyiseverything","#losangeles","#california","#daily"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":16,"Timestamp":1597628959,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 03:49:19 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"And just like that \u2018\u2018twas the night before year first day of school.\u201D\n\nWe did haircuts, pulled out the uniforms, got the water bottles personalized, first day shirts made; the special cookie treats packed (JRho Cookie Co.) and lunches prepared. \n\nThe kids went to bed excited for a new year and as they sleep I sit here looking back through previous years of pictures and hoping for another great first day tomorrow! 💙\n\nIn March we experienced quite an abrupt halt and quick change of direction after spring break. Kids (and parents) were left confused and unsure of how to do school (and work)from home. \n\nWe had the strangest summer ever; Words like covid and corona, social distancing, 6 feet, sanitizer became the new norm.  We did drive by birthday, drive way happy hours, canceled vacations, had toilet papers shortages and passed around hand sanitizer like never before. But we also learned to enjoy the slower pace and connect more with each other, had lots of outside play time and spent many evenings outside until the sun want down! \n\nThis school year will not look like anything we have seen before, as parents we have had to make the hardest decisions EVER about how are kids would return to school (assuming you were given a choice) But in the end we made the choice that was best for our individual families. \n\nI have seen the hard work the teaches and faculty have put into to make sure everyone is safe and that kids who are learning virtually can have as normal of a year as possible\u2014- for that THANK YOU! 🖤\n\nSo tonight as I go to bed I\u2019ll keep the teachers, the staff, the kids and parents in my prayers. \n\nI hope all students and teachers retuning today school tomorrow have a great day!

If the virus had been genetically engineered in a lab there would be signs of manipulation in the genome data.\n\nThis would include evidence of an existing viral sequence as the backbone for the new virus, and obvious, targeted inserted (or deleted) genetic elements.\nBut no such evidence exists. It is very unlikely that any techniques used to genetically engineer the virus would not leave a genetic signature, like specific identifiable pieces of DNA code.\n\nThe genome of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of other bat coronaviruses, as well as those of pangolins, all of which have a similar overall genomic architecture. Differences between the genomes of these coronaviruses show natural patterns typical of coronavirus evolution. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 evolved from a previous wild coronavirus.\n\n Some scientists have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may have come from another known bat virus (RaTG13) found by researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The genomes of these two viruses are 96% similar to one another.\n\nThis might sound very close but in evolutionary terms this actually makes them significantly different and the two have been shown to share a common ancestor. This shows that RaGT13 is not the ancestor of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nIn fact, SARS-CoV-2 most likely evolved from a viral variant that couldn't survive for a long period of time or that persists at low levels in bats.\n\n#bats #batvirus #pandemic #pandemic2020 #virus2020 #virus #covid #covid19 #scientist #sci #pharmsci #pharmacyblog #pharmacyawarness #pharmacist #pharmaclass #sarscov2 #sars #epidemic","NumberOfLikes":16,"Hashtags":["#bats","#batvirus","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#virus2020","#virus","#covid","#covid19","#scientist","#sci","#pharmsci","#pharmacyblog","#pharmacyawarness","#pharmacist","#pharmaclass","#sarscov2","#sars","#epidemic"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597591789,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 16 17:29:49 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Pandemic day154: Mini cheddar bay biscuits #cheddarbaybiscuits #biscuits #alexcooksyum #pandemicbaking #pandemic2020 #breadtime","NumberOfLikes":14,"Hashtags":["#cheddarbaybiscuits","#biscuits","#alexcooksyum","#pandemicbaking","#pandemic2020","#breadtime"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Alexandra Burke on August 16, 2020.

They are no longer the hardest hit community in the US when it comes to COVID-19. \n\nThe reopening process has begun in the nation after having the most strict curfews in America. This pandemic is sticking around longer than any of us would like. The Navajos still need our help so my journey to make a difference continues. Helping the Navajo Nation has been one of the greatest accomplishments of my life. Never thought how much of a difference a can of Lysol would make. Thank you to those who have donated to my cause. \n\nShout-out to my favorite Kell for the opportunity. During this pandemic, Kell has helped me raise funds for the Navajo, taught me a lot about human rights, Black Lives Matter, and his background. Honestly, Kell has stepped in the shoes of someone who is Black because he understands way better than most the struggle of my people. He has seen it way too many times not to and he continues to fight for me and Blacks across this country to end systematic racism. He inspires me in many ways.

Before today I had only heard of these inequalities, but today we were thrown into the thick of it. My daughter developed concerning symptoms on Friday night and we were directed to wait until our PCP opened the next morning. The waiting was awful. 😰 All the unknowns came flooding in. When the office finally opened we were directed to a virtual visit because she had symptoms. The option to possibly come in for lab draws\/tests if needed was on the table. Well apparently weekend COVID-19 testing wasn\u2019t accessible to our PCP. 😧 But they were happy to prophylactically treat her strep! Wait hold on a minute. We don\u2019t know if she has strep or a cold or a virus or COVID-19, but let\u2019s fill her with an antibiotic and make her wait for a COVID-19 test. Seems like a great plan. 🤨 However waiting for the test not only affected our family, but puts all the staff, children and parents of our daycare and anyone else she\u2019s been around at risk which I was so uncomfortable with. And not knowing if she has strep affects our son. He\u2019s at risk for a rheumatic fever flare up if he\u2019s exposed. We didn\u2019t want to put him through a strep test if we don\u2019t even know whether or not our daughter has strep. He was more then welcome to come in and get a strep test, but not the child who has symptoms. Does that seem right? \n\nI get that precautions have to be in place but this whole situation just doesn\u2019t sit well. Thankfully we have a wonderful children\u2019s hospital in our town who was more then happy to see her, evaluate her and test her for both strep and COVID-19 today!  The rapid strep test was negative! 🥳 No antibiotic for her and no unnecessary testing for our son. 🙌🏼 We still don\u2019t have access to rapid COVID-19 testing so we\u2019re hoping for the 24hr timeframe turnaround vs the 72hr time frame. 🤞🏼And lastly thank you to everyone who has reached out and supported us during these unwavering hours. Our neighbors for bringing snacks and sending love messages to our daughter so she can look out the window and smile. And our family for just being there! 💜","NumberOfLikes":21,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Heather Feingold on August 15, 2020.

I do miss being able to play games in person and do things like celebrate birthdays via a party, but I am simply around too many people everyday, several of whom don't know or care to wear their masks properly.

Today\u2019s stop is the front of the same high school where literally every movie and tv show you\u2019ve ever seen was filmed! \n\nDesigned by architect George M. Lindsey in the Collegiate Gothic style, and constructed in 1930, John Marshall High School is located at \u202A3939 Tracy St., Los Feliz \u202C. Please note that this is a public school so if you decide to visit it please do not trespass or disturb anybody working or attending school there.\n\nThe school is popular among filmmakers for its gothic architecture, which lends itself to double as a school that can be located in any number of places around the country. For example Tom Hanks drove a bus for John Marshall students in \u201CBachelor Party\u201D, Luke Perry and Kristie Swanson attended school there in the \u201CBuffy the Vampire Slayer\u201D movie, it was a religious academy in the Sarah Jessica Parker-Helen Hunt comedy \u201CGirls Just Wanna Have Fun\u201D, it stood in for Dewey High on \u201CGrowing Pains\u201D  and John Adams High on \u201CBoy Meets World\u201D, and the site of the therapy session between Dr. Evil and his son in \u201CAustin Powers 2.\u201D \n\nThere have also been a slew of famous people that went to school here including actor Leonardo DiCaprio, NFL Hall of Fame player Mike Haynes, Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss, actress Julie Newmar, known for her role as Catwoman in the television series Batman, singer and member of the 1960s singing group The Mamas and the Papas Michelle Phillips, and vocalist, producer and songwriter for The Black Eyed Peas will.i.am! \n\nFun facts - While it\u2019s set in the Chicago suburbs, \u201CPretty in Pink\u201D (1986), was actually filmed in LA. John Marshall\u2019s red-brick facade practically screams \u201CMidwest educational institution,\u201D making it an obvious stand-in for Andie's (Molly Ringwald) Illinois high school.\n\nThe school\u2019s front entrance also gets a bit of screen time, as does the old library, in the music video for Van Halen's \u201CHot for Teacher\u201D! \n #filminglocation #losfeliz #johnmarshallhighschool #hollywoodtour #pandemic2020 #socialdistancing #wearamask #tonymiros","NumberOfLikes":53,"Hashtags":["#filminglocation","#losfeliz","#johnmarshallhighschool","#hollywoodtour","#pandemic2020","#socialdistancing","#wearamask","#tonymiros"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1597514529,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 20:02:09 CEST 2020","Location":"John Marshall High School (Los Angeles)"},{"CaptionText":"Our ombré style sunglasses are in right now!

Where many times even the touch of something on my face can send me into a painful feel of shocks, fire underneath my skin, pins & needles and pain I can't even discribe on each side of my face, for weeks, sometimes even months. So No, running to Dollar General, with a mask, to get some bread is NOT worth WEEKS of excruciating pain, I'm Sorry. This is especially bad when I am in need of a Trigiminal Block, which I am now.

When people tell me:\n\"You don't look autistic.\" \nWell what does autism look like?.\nNormally I have learned to cope. But I will get set off, it can result in anger, or tears, just depends on the weight of the day. \nSo if I have a bunch of \"Karens\" in the grocery store telling me I'm intentionally spreading the virus it might result in tears & then my level of anxiety gets up to a 12 & I'm no good for days.\n\u2022\u2022\nI do care about others and myself. (& people may get at me for saying this), but I do not care for others enough to put myself in pain. Don't get me wrong I can wear a mask, I mean I have it pictured.

Begitulah kira-kira kata orang-orang. Sejak kecil pun, mama sudah mewanti-wanti untuk selalu merawat rambut. Berbagai produk shampoo pun sudah pernah aku cobain, terlebih beberapa bulan ke belakang ini. Karena shampoo yang biasa aku pakai sejak zaman SMA, sudah nggak ampuh lagi untuk mengurangi kerontokan dan mengatasi rambut lepek. Sejak pandemic datang rambut aku yang biasanya tahan terhadap coloring berganti-ganti warna dan bleaching sampai kini ia pun rontok jua. Sampai akhirnya aku mencoba rangkaian produk shampoo dan treatment dari Moist Diane. \n@moistdianeid ⬅️\n\nAnyway, apakah ada yang sudah pernah mencoba Moist Diane Shampoo  dan Treatment? @moistdianeid . Produk asal Jepang yang diproduksi oleh NatureLab ini akhirnya resmi masuk ke Indonesia dan sudah mengantongi izin BPOM. Sehingga nggak perlu ragu lagi untuk beli produk ini.⬅️\n\nSementara brand ini sebenarnya sudah lebih dulu terkenal di luar negeri, seperti di Singapore, Hongkong, Malaysia, Thailand, Amerika, Korea Selatan, Vietnam, dan Amerika Serikat. Di negara asalnya, Jepang, Moist Diane Perfect Beauty Shampoo & Treatment sudah menjadi best seller. Dalam sepuluh hari saja, ada satu juta botol Moist Diane yang berhasil terjual. Nggak heran ya kenapa rambut cewek-cewek Jepang pada bagus-bagus.⬅️\n\nKlaim produk ini adalah tidak mengandung silikon, sulfat, dan paraben. Moist Diane hanya menggunakan bahan-bahan alami yang aman untuk rambut. Beauty keratin yang digunakan untuk memperbaiki struktur rambut pada produk Moist Diane juga termasuk shampoo aman untuk teman-teman muslim.⬅️\n\nKalian bisa kirim pesan ke admin instagramnya di @moistdianeid untuk tanya-tanya mengenai ketersediaan stock produk atau sekedar konsultasi mengenai permasalahan rambut kalian. Biar nggak salah pilih varian juga.⬅️\n\n#moist #diane #moistdiane #shampoo #shampo #premium #shampoopremium #shampooandconditioner #shampooantirontok #viralshampoo #hairshampoo #dailyshampoo #dailyshampooandconditioner #shampoomoistdiane #shampoomoisturizing #shampoomoistdianeantilepek #covid19 #pandemic #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife #coronavirus #corona #newnormal #newnormal2020","NumberOfLikes":85,"Hashtags":["#moist","#diane","#moistdiane","#shampoo","#shampo","#premium","#shampoopremium","#shampooandconditioner","#shampooantirontok","#viralshampoo","#hairshampoo","#dailyshampoo","#dailyshampooandconditioner","#shampoomoistdiane","#shampoomoisturizing","#shampoomoistdianeantilepek","#covid19","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#pandemiclife","#coronavirus","#corona","#newnormal","#newnormal2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1597503336,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 16:55:36 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"@lamarkphotos  en #hotelelmuelle 👻\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#abandonedplaces #sesiondefotos #photographer #photography #nikonphotography #nikon_ar #abandonedhotel #lacosta #fotografos_argentinos #fotografoscosteros #portrait #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":25,"Hashtags":["#hotelelmuelle","#abandonedplaces","#sesiondefotos","#photographer","#photography","#nikonphotography","#nikon_ar","#abandonedhotel","#lacosta","#fotografos_argentinos","#fotografoscosteros","#portrait","#pandemic2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Ivana Locardel fotografía in El muelle De Mar De Ajo with @lamarkphotos.

Never in a million years did I think getting a mask 😷, and checking daily temp would be part of the back to school list. This year has left me scratching my head on many occasions. The school Bailey goes to handled it very well. There was so much excitement on property! The teachers were genuinely excited to see all the kids. They made it a very special time for kids and parents. They helped lighten the load of the \u201Cshock factor\u201D of showing up to school with everyone in masks and all the different precautions in place. I am grateful that they chose to open her school. \n\nI also continue to be amazed watching my friends who are homeschooling their children. Talk about rising to the occasion and making the best of it. I have seen makeshift home classrooms(super cool by the way), activity centers, daily schedules, and most of all I\u2019ve seen parents connecting with other parents. I know these parents are being hard on themselves and going a little crazy, but please know you are doing AMAZING!! I have so much respect and admiration for you. \n\nOn a side note my heart is full seeing just how capable each of us are. It amazes me to see how we can adapt in hopes of making a better future for our children. While we may not agree with everything, for me personally I don\u2019t agree with a lot, but it\u2019s important that we continue to do and be our best for our kids and our future. Even if there are things that seem out of our control, what we choose to do within our own home could be what makes a lasting difference. There are so many of you that I\u2019ve connected with during this crazy time. I am so grateful for the connection and friendships that have come from this. I hope y\u2019all have a great weekend! \n\n#blogger #nashvilleblogger #vlogger #nashvillevlogger #backtoschool #backtoschool2020 #homeschool #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife #riseuptogether #riseabove #future #school #saturdaymood #family #friends #familyofinstagram #2020","NumberOfLikes":310,"Hashtags":["#blogger","#nashvilleblogger","#vlogger","#nashvillevlogger","#backtoschool","#backtoschool2020","#homeschool","#pandemic2020","#pandemiclife","#riseuptogether","#riseabove","#future","#school","#saturdaymood","#family","#friends","#familyofinstagram","#2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":13,"Timestamp":1597501463,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 16:24:23 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Different sizes dispensers available..\n\n1 246 831 1061 or 1 246 546 4707 \n\n#pandemic2020 #covid19 #sanitizer #clean","NumberOfLikes":1,"Hashtags":["#pandemic2020","#covid19","#sanitizer","#clean"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597501440,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 16:24:00 CEST 2020","Location":"Christ Church, Barbados"},{"CaptionText":"A message from @ankitadave_1 😇🇮🇳\n.\n.\n.\nFollow @xappie.bollywood \n\n#AnkitaDave #bollywood #actress #happyindependenceday #covid19 #staysafe #stayhygiene #pandemic2020 #hindiactress #bollywoodindustry #hindifilms #actresslife #messagetoall #independence2020 #hindifilmindustry #xappiebollywood","NumberOfLikes":8,"Hashtags":["#AnkitaDave","#bollywood","#actress","#happyindependenceday","#covid19","#staysafe","#stayhygiene","#pandemic2020","#hindiactress","#bollywoodindustry","#hindifilms","#actresslife","#messagetoall","#independence2020","#hindifilmindustry","#xappiebollywood"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Xappie on August 15, 2020 tagging @ankitadave_1.

As we are all struggling to keep our heads above water it\u2019s more important than ever to celebrate each other in all our accomplishments, small and large. Inspiration is everywhere, believe it or not! \n\nToday, let\u2019s salute this gorgeous, go-getter Mama! Mom to two beautiful \u2013 7 and almost 1 year-old boys - Nosa Adetiba has spent the last 13 years doing her part to make the world a better place as a professional fundraiser and marketer for various national non-profit organizations.\n\nAfter many years as a member of the DMFA (Direct Marketing Fundraisers Association) -  attending luncheons, webinars, learning and networking \u2013 her experience and passion awarded her a seat at the big table. Nosa was recently appointed to join the DMFA board of directors - a huge accomplishment worthy of celebration! Women, especially women of color, are severely underrepresented on boards across the country, so every seat is a win and a step in the right direction.\n\nIn addition, Nosa also sits on the board of She Builds Lives, a non-profit focused on educating economically disadvantaged children in her native Nigeria. How does she find the time to balance two kids, a non-profit career, and two board of director appointments while navigating a pandemic? This Mama\u2019s got Mojo, that\u2019s how!\n\n\u201CJuggling career and motherhood isn\u2019t always easy, especially during a pandemic, but I\u2019m doing my best to keep things as \u2018normal\u2019 and fun as possible for my sons, especially my 7 year old. I also try very hard to carve out sometime for Nosa, so I\u2019m not pouring from an empty cup - just a half full one 😝\u201D\n\nNosa is an inspiration to all of us.

Biden Jr. make their decision in November.\n\nBefore the coronavirus crisis consumed his White House, his 2016 rallying cry of \u201Cbuild the wall\u201D still echoed in his re-election campaign. Construction of a wall along the country\u2019s southern border, intended to halt the flow of undocumented immigrants into the country, has been slow going, but an immigration crackdown has remained one of the policy issues that enlivens his base. Mr. Trump has even tried to use immigration as a way to change the subject from criticism of his administration\u2019s handling of the pandemic.\n\nMr. Trump has also made eliminating federal regulations a priority, with a focus on dismantling Obama-era environmental regulations. So far, he has failed to achieve his top legislative priority when he came into office: repealing the Affordable Care Act. But he has pleased Republicans, in particular, with his commitment to appointing conservative judges to the federal bench at a record-setting pace.\n\nMr. Trump touts two trade deals as his signature policies, even as they mark a break from Republican free-trade orthodoxy in favor of a populist approach: an initial trade agreement with China, and his revised accord with Mexico and Canada. His foreign policy doctrine can be summed up by the phrase \u201CAmerica First,\u201D a banner under which Mr. Trump has over the years questioned the founding tenets of alliances like NATO, and demonstrated a reluctance to engage in overseas military operations.\n\nSource: @nytimes #NYtimes\n#Connecticut #CT #PrimaryElection #August2020 #GeneralElection #November2020 #Republican #Republicans #RepublicanParty #CTgop #DonaldTrump #PresidentTrump #WhiteHouse #Politics #UnitedStates #Election2020 #ElectionDay #Vote #Vote2020 #CTvote2020 #RegisterToVote #VoteByMail #AbsenteeBallot #BLM #BlackLivesMatter #COVID19 #Coronavirus #Pandemic2020 #2020","NumberOfLikes":7,"Hashtags":["#NYtimes","#Connecticut","#CT","#PrimaryElection","#August2020","#GeneralElection","#November2020","#Republican","#Republicans","#RepublicanParty","#CTgop","#DonaldTrump","#PresidentTrump","#WhiteHouse","#Politics","#UnitedStates","#Election2020","#ElectionDay","#Vote","#Vote2020","#CTvote2020","#RegisterToVote","#VoteByMail","#AbsenteeBallot","#BLM","#BlackLivesMatter","#COVID19","#Coronavirus","#Pandemic2020","#2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by CT Vote 2020 in Shelton, Connecticut.

Trump has inherited the Death Star of mind manipulation. The digital dictatorship that we have been living under which knows our behaviors better than our own families...and even ourselves.  Even our leader Putin says \u201Cthe nation that leads in AI will be the ruler of the world\u201D \n\nWe are now trapped in a world of mass confusion and hysteria mixed with lies and peppered with our own desperation and fear.

Stay silent and afraid and follow the herd to the cliff or begin the process of reeducating yourself on what has been happening to America and it\u2019s people to come to this point in the road of history.

[This pic taken by their little\u2019s] This couple deserve a parents of the year award for making a move during a pandemic! .\n. \n. \nHere\u2019s the brief synopsis: 9 years ago we helped Josh and Victoria when they were newlyweds buy their first home. In the meantime, their family grew. They had 3 kids and decided to make a move to a larger more spacious home in 2020. Their careers were expanding and all was looking bright. .\n. \n. \nWe were delighted at the beginning of this year to hear from them asking for our help again! We were happy to give them staging advice and set them on the path to sell and buy. We had gotten partial photos of the house as the house preparations were underway. We were getting them ready to list and to home shop. Then, BAM! A pandemic hit... A quarantine happened. .\n. \n. \nWhat a roller coaster ride to get from point A to point B. Listing virtually. Showing virtually. Home shopping virtually. What a stressful experience for the kids. .\n. \n. \nEven once everything was under contract, then getting it closed safely and smoothly was not easy. We are grateful everything came together. And this beautiful family is now happily settled into their new home! .\n. \n. \nPlease take a moment to help me congratulate them! They deserve a medal! (And please tell the kids they did a great job on this photo!) ☺️🙌🏼🏡 .\n. \n. \n\n#youarehome #statecollege #bellefonte #realestate #nyssasmithandco #kellerwilliams #advantage #realty #realtorlife #quarantinelife #pandemic2020 #covid19","NumberOfLikes":48,"Hashtags":["#youarehome","#statecollege","#bellefonte","#realestate","#nyssasmithandco","#kellerwilliams","#advantage","#realty","#realtorlife","#quarantinelife","#pandemic2020","#covid19"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Nyssa Smith 🙋🏼\u200D♀️🌸👜 on August 14, 2020.

With increases breakouts, I\u2019m using a glycolic cleanser often and using salicylic acid for spot treatments. Always moisturize before you put on your SPF, even if you\u2019re masking for 12hours daily. This protects your skin!✌🏼 stay safe and mask on!\n#skintip #pandemic2020 #pandemicskin #pandemicskincare #esthetician #skincare #rootsesthetics #skincareroutine #pnwskincare #seattleesthetician #renton","NumberOfLikes":16,"Hashtags":["#skintip","#pandemic2020","#pandemicskin","#pandemicskincare","#esthetician","#skincare","#rootsesthetics","#skincareroutine","#pnwskincare","#seattleesthetician","#renton"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Kannith, LME on August 14, 2020.

Not that anyone needs to give a reason as to why they choose to do something, but it is 100% the right choice for our family at this point. \u2063\n\u2063\nThis is what a typical conversation sounds like lately.\u2063\n\u2063\nQ: Why do you want to send them back to school?\u2063\n\u2063\nA: They need to be at school. We struggled a lot with online learning in the spring and know that Isla will do much better and thrive in a school environment again. Nash too is also so excited to start JK and we want him to experience it no matter what it looks like.\u2063\n\u2063\nQ: Are you not worried about the long term affects and what they will feel seeing everyone in masks and gloves all the time?\u2063\n\u2063\nA: No. I am worried about the long term affects of NOT going back to school. As for masks, in 10 years from now we will talk and my kids will say \u201Cremember that time we had to go back to school and wear masks? That was crazy eh?\u201D I don\u2019t feel like having to wear masks and seeing people wear masks will cause them future struggles, IMO.\n\u2063\nQ: Are you not scared of everything that could happen?\u2063\n\u2063\nA: When the whole pandemic started, I chose not to live in fear. Fear gets you nowhere, fast. We respect what\u2019s happening, take the proper precautions and have instilled all of those things with our kids including the importance of hand washing, distancing and masks. I have to be confident that other people will be doing the same and that the schools have everyones safety as their first priority.\u2063\n\u2063\nAll of this being said, if things take a drastic turn, or the school year starts and I am less than impressed about how things are going down, we may change how we are doing things. But, for now, the kids will be getting on that school bus with their labelled matching masks in September. \u2063\n\u2063\nWhatever you are choosing to do this school year, you have made the right choice for you and your family.

And that's okay! This is the year of Plan B's (or C's or D's...). And not just for you, but for EVERYONE. Do what you can with what you've got... THAT'S the new Plan A. It can still be a pretty darn good one if we give ourselves grace and have the right perspective✨🔎. \n.\n#differentyear #pandemic2020 #perspective #grace #patience #planB #shiftingexpectations","NumberOfLikes":11,"Hashtags":["#differentyear","#pandemic2020","#perspective","#grace","#patience","#planB","#shiftingexpectations"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Hope 🙋🏼\u200D♀️ |Fitness|Yoga|Life in Jacksonville, Florida.
