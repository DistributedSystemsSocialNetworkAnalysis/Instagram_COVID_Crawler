Northeastern states home to the first viral hotspots -- including New Jersey and New York -- have largely quelled their worst outbreaks, but case counts have spiked in the southern and southwestern states over the past month. Case counts are swelling in California and reaching new peaks in Colorado, Louisiana, Washington and Wisconsin. As of Tuesday, the United States had more total cases than any other country in the world and the largest share of cases as a proportion of the country's population.\n\nMany colleges planning to bring students back to campus for the fall semester have reversed course entirely and opted for online-only instruction. \n\nRead more (copy\/paste to browser):\nhttps:\/\/www.insidehighered.com\/news\/2020\/08\/12\/hundreds-colleges-walk-back-fall-reopening-plans-and-opt-online-only-instruction\n\nNeed advice?\nSchedule your FREE Strategy Session at the link in @collegereadyplan.\n\n----------\nCollege Ready.\nWe help students get into college and graduate debt-free!\n\nFor more college admission tips,\nüëâ @collegereadyplan üëà\nüëâ @collegereadyplan üëà\nüëâ @collegereadyplan üëà\n\n#collegeready #collegenews #collegelife #pandemiclife #covidlife #collegeacceptance #collegeadmissions #collegereopen #collegeaccess #collegeprep #freecollege #busymoms #busymomma #busymum #busymums #pandemic2020 #classof2020üéì #collegetime #collegetips #collegeforall #educationmatters #onlinelearning #educationplanning","NumberOfLikes":7,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597411893,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 14 15:31:33 CEST 2020","Location":"Los Angeles, California"},{"CaptionText":"Ceasa RJ #2020 \n\n- o alimento que brota no campo percorre um longo caminho at√© chegar a sua mesa. \n\n#pandemic2020 #pandemia2020 #photography #documentaryphotography #documental #fotografia #rj","NumberOfLikes":47,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Douglas Bezerra Lopes in Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro.

Also add 2 Tea Bags, Tej Patta, Badi Elaichi, Daalcheeni, Chakra Phool, Javitri, 4-5 Laung, 8-10 Black Peppercorns, 1 tsp Salt, and 1 tsp Ghee. Cook till one whistle on high flame and then 30 minutes on low flame.

It took me 4-5 minutes. Now add 5 finely chopped Tomatoes and mixer ground paste of 2 inch Ginger and 2 Green Chillies. Also add 2 tsp Salt as soon as you add the Tomatoes. Now bhuno till you see the Oil and the Tomatoes are really well done. Now add the Chhole with the Water to the Karahi and cook till you get a khadka or a boil. Meanwhile mash the Chhole a little in the Karahi and wait for the khadka. Also add some chopped Coriander.\n\u2022For the Chhaunk\/Vaghar\/Tadka take 2tsp of Ghee and heat it and add 2 Green Chillies slit vertically and some Ginger cut vertically too like strands.

Berbeda dengan yogurt, kefir ini merupakan hasil fermentasi kultur gabungan bakteri dan yeast (baik, tidak menyakiti kamu ü§ó) yang bisa bertahan hidup di saluran percenaan meskipun ada di lambung yang sangat asam. Karena bisa bertahan hidup, kultur ini bisa melawan berbagai mikroba jahat di saluran pencernaan. \n\nDitelusuri dari asal muasalnya pun, kefir telah terbukti membuat orang-orang di pegunungan Kaukasus berumur panjang, jarang kenal penyakit. Bahkan ada legenda yang menceritakan bahwa pembuatan minuman ini diperkenalkan oleh Nabi Muhammad kepada kaum ortodoks (religius) sehingga kefir grains (kultur kefir) disebut-sebut sebagai \"Grains of the Prophet\". Pembuatan kefir ini pun awalnya dirahasiakan dengan sangat ketat karena kaum mereka takut akan kehilangan \"kekuatan\" mereka bila kefir grains dan cara membuatnya disebarluaskan. \n\nPercaya atau tidak, kefir sudah terbukti bisa \"membantu\" sel-sel imun tubuhmu melawan covid-19.

He built it a distance from the water.  It was strong, solid and looked awesome.  He was having a great time playing with his castle.  It was even better because we didn't remember to bring the sand toys. So, he improvised with the one little shovel that we had in the car and my shaker cup for my smoothies. ‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nThen, suddenly out of nowhere a big wave came and washed it away.  Jayden was so sad.  Then he got angry at the wave. He looked at me with confusion.  He gave one of those how could this happen looks as he asked, \"why did the wave knock over my castle?\"‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nHow many of us can relate to how Jayden was feeling?  We have built something amazing.  Maybe it's a career, a lifestyle, a family, a home....then suddenly something unexpected comes crashing in and destroys our hard work.  This year, 2020 has been filled with destruction of dreams, hard work and plans.  All of us are standing in the ruins of what we build and feeling confused, angry, sad and even afraid.‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nI answered his question by saying, \"The waves are pulled by the moon.  The water level moves back and forth along the beach everyday.  It happens slowly so sometimes we don't notice until it is too close.\" As I explained this to him, I thought, this the first of many lessons on this.  We as humans make plans, work towards goals and build dreams.  Suddenly, all of our hard work is washed away and we are given a clean slate. ‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nJayden looked up at me and looked around him.  He realized he was still at the beach.  He was still surrounded by sun, water and sand so he ran off to play in the surf again.  I was very proud of him in this moment.  As a child who has PANS, this event could have triggered rage and a meltdown.  Instead, he rolled with it and enjoyed himself.  That was an amazing moment for me to see.‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nI know what we have lost is bigger than a sand castle.  I know it's harder for us to get up and go again.  Yet, like Jayden we are given a chance to try something different because what we were working on has changed, shifted or is gone.‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nWhat are you going to build in its place?

Lara also thought about sending you to Mars (insert Mars Bar chocolate) or the Milky Way (insert Milky Way chocolate) but we told her that it could only happen in your dreams (insert dream chocolate). \nSo instead we thought a trip to Bunnings Warehouse (we have a voucher for him you can buy them online or at coles) would be just as nice! \nWhile you are there we wanted to make sure you had some cash $5 (insert wallet with $5 - we made another because of the green background it didn\u2019t stand out) to spend on a snag and coke (Diet Coke sign) because we know mum is always stealing your cash! \nSo on this Father\u2019s Day, why don\u2019t you take some time out. Kick off your shoes and put on these slippers (see previous post on how to make the slippers) we made for you (which we think are really nice)!

Experiencing death so close sucks the joy out of life and makes getting up a chore that weighs a thousand pounds. But every time we think those though are going to take over, we see a little ray of sunshine in the beauty of a sunset, the sound of a laugh, the birth of new little ones that we can't wait to meet and we find comfort in those to help balance the feelings of loss. This time has undoubtedly challenged our sense of joy in the world. But, as we told a friend today, we are determined to continue to smile as much as possible every day, and even if all the smiles are not real, we will continue to do it till we can feel every single one of those smiles.

And it is magnified through social media. And a pandemic. And quarantine. Social comparison is not a new thing and it\u2019s easy to think that others have more or are having a better go at it in quarantine than you are. But what we have to remember is that money does not equal happiness. It may equal opportunities, choices, options, and variety, but it does not make people happy. I think it\u2019s important to separate this out. It\u2019s easy to assume that someone you envy is happy and carefree and to then discredit what is good in your life. The pandemic has increased the divide between the advantaged and disadvantaged so there\u2019s more opportunity to compare yourself in unfavorable ways. But there are positives for almost everyone, sometimes you just have to look a little harder and a little longer than the next person. But I\u2019m pretty sure if you look (maybe long and hard!) you will be able to find something favorable and positive in your own life.‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\n#quarantine #quarantinelife #pandemic #pandemic2020 #socialdistancing #socialmedia #socialcomparison #envy #envyme #envious #enviouspeople #jealous #jealousy #jealouspeople #money #moneymindset #happiness #grateful #happy #happinessüíï #happinessproject #happinessisachoice #happinessbegins #happinessbeginswithgratitude #happinessbeginswithgiving #happinessbeginswithgrace #comparison #comparisonisthethiefofjoy #comparisonfree #comparisontrap","NumberOfLikes":5,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Samantha Gambino on August 13, 2020.

As they walk hand in hand , pandemics such as the novel Corona Virus uprooted from China and spread to the world have continued to massacre a millions of life on earth. In such circumstances , imparting knowledge seems to a bigger challenge. \nMoreover providing an online platform as a medium of instruction might be basic solution but has broadened the path of problems arising due to it.\n.\nChallenges of Online Education ( E-Platform)\n\n1. Unavailability of resources to rural areas : Covering the issues of poor society , it is evident that the unavailability of resources and sparse knowledge of technology has made impossible for rural kids to take advantage of online education. It has not only closed their means of education but also has increased the burden of monetary funds for buying of smartphones or tablets.\n2. Slow Urbanisation: Not only the rural areas have been affected but also filled up an irreplaceable void between the mode of education and urban children. The lack of networks is a major problem but apart from that there are severe other things to be noted such as change in attitude of the individual , behavioral differences , competitive attributes and growth of shyness and ignorant state of mind are also to be seen in a massive amount if not addressed now.\n3. Natural Calamities : The landslides in Kerala , Flood in Bihar, Assam, Mumbai , West Bengal and Odisha , Earthquake in Delhi and several other calamities haven't been taken into consideration before starting online education. Migration is one such circumstantial issue. The children of that region have been facing such disasters with an unavoidable pandemic has remained unchecked by the Ministry of Education.

Disaster capitalism is: governments reseizing squatter or involuntarily unoccupied land for redevelopment of high-return endeavours (HURRICANE KATRINA ANYBODY? 2004 TSUNAMI?); or the purchase of property in burst housing bubbles by real estate magnates. The list goes on. Essentially, disaster capitalism refers to the entrenching of capitalist and neoliberal systems in a state whereby the less disadvantaged are the least immobilised. \n.\nI argue that disaster capitalist also refers to narrative. In a society fragmented and disrupted by an unknown and invisible threat, facing recession and austerity, the government swoops in to tighten the belt and worsen the lot for the most disadvantaged. And the narrative fits, allowing cash to take a different course that in other times may not stand the test of public opinion.\n.\nEvery time the government comes out with another scheme that drops the cost of this pandemic and its recession onto young people and their futures, I think of disaster capitalism.

For anything familial I'm usually the glue in between the cracks that remain this was the year that I couldn't physically do it, be the Amma (Mother) 'gap filler' as it were. I couldn't be there attempting to create the aromas in the kitchen in homage to her. Calling everyone to the table a gazillion times before resorting to \"I'm eating without you all!\" Loading up everybody's plates, until no actual plate remains. You know, \"mum stuff\" - but I also know that some of you may not know. That is a grief that I do not bear. The guilt was a lot for the first Eid in isolation, by the second it simmered. What I could do was wear her shari (her clothing) without the feel of shame in doing so, for the fear of causing upset. Albeit it was secretly away done from the family. The first Eid I didn't get changed until gone 8pm as I spent the day \"should I, shouldn't I?\" I'm glad I did! it made all the difference. The feel of her shari. Even though they are washed, her scent remains - or it may just be a psychological hold that I have created. Whichever it is, I'll welcome it. The Eid that followed a few months later, getting changed was the first thing I did. Still in isolation, but there was an Eid treasure hunt with the duo and a mouthwatering version of juicy yet crunchy fried chicken.

Located just up the hill from the \u201CSnow White Cottages\u201D in Los Feliz - on Lyric Avenue - you\u2019ll find the identical homes of Walt & Roy Disney! \n\nFollowing the success of their first cartoon character \u201COswald the Lucky Rabbit\u201D in 1926, Walt and Roy bought an empty lot on Lyric Avenue in Los Feliz (not far from their new Disney Hyperion Studios) and built matching homes next door to each other! \n\nAfter construction was completed, Walt and Lillian moved into their home at 2495 Lyric Avenue and Roy and Edna moved in next door at 2491 Lyric Avenue - luckily both homes still stand today! Please note that these are private residences so if you visit please do not trespass or disturb the people that live there.\n\nLittle did Walt know that his distributor, Charles Mintz, owned the rights to Oswald\u2019s cartoons. Disney wouldn\u2019t let the threat of losing Oswald get him down, as he had something bigger in the works. It was in the garage of this house that Walt, Roy, and his chief animator Ub Iwerks secretly worked on Mickey Mouse cartoons while they were still under contract with Universal Studios for Oswald. In the end, Universal ended up with the rights to Oswald, and Disney sketched a character that would eclipse Oswald in popularity: Mickey Mouse! \n\nAfter the success of Mickey Mouse and the studio\u2019s first Oscar (Silly Symphonies Flowers and Treeswon the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, the first time an award in this category was given out) the Disney\u2019s moved to Woking Way in 1932.\n\nFun fact - Walt Disney didn\u2019t draw Mickey Mouse. He did at first, but it didn\u2019t last long\u2014after 1928, Walt was no longer animating, focusing instead on story development and direction. He relied on Iwerks and other artists to do the drawing dirty work. Walt Disney did voice Mickey Mouse. From 1928 to 1947, Walt was the man behind the mouse\u2014literally. #waltdisney #lyricavenue #hollywoodhistory #mickeymouse #losfeliz #hollywoodtour #pandemic2020 #socialdistancing #wearamasküò∑ #tonymiros","NumberOfLikes":50,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1597253800,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 12 19:36:40 CEST 2020","Location":"Los Feliz"},{"CaptionText":"*PPE* Hotter than a hot man's hot bits..\n.\n\nBeen on-call today.

In the last 2 months, more than 20,000 Covid positive patients and their families have been touched and counselled for any mental issues that they might be facing. Also, their problems  of financial distress, lack of availability of commodities, etc have been attempted to be addressed too with the sincere aid of the District administration and the Dept. Of Health. \n\nBut the feather on the cap right now is that Monon has started to reach out to the general public as well, especially the children, who have been massively hit by the lockdown. We are now organising online competitions in the categories of Drawing\/Painting, Jingle contest, Music Contest, Dance, Poetry Recitation and Mime, and many more are still on the tracks. The responses we have received so far have been overwhelming. And what the children have to offer have motivated us to work harder and stronger. üôÇ\n\nI sincerely hope that Monon can reach and surpass the targets that it kept at its outset because Mental Health of each and everyone of us out here and out there matters.

Duke University recently published a study on August 7, 2020 which focused on which type of mask is more effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19. \u2063\n\u2063\nOne of the authors and Associate Professor of Medicine at Duke University, Dr. Eric Westman, says the study is one of the first that focuses on masks made for community use, such as cotton masks or bandanas. \u2063\n\u2063\nResearchers tested 14 different types of commonly used masks that they have seen used in communities. They wanted to figure out which masks are good and which are bad. The study used a laser, camera, and black box to visualize the respiratory droplet particles that we don\u2019t readily see. A subject would then say, \u201Cstay healthy people\u201D five times, and the number of particles dispersed would be reviewed. \u2063\n\u2063\nWhat did they find? The well-fitted N95 masks without valves and three-layer surgical masks are the safest option. However, these masks should still be reserved for health care workers who directly care for patients in the hospitals and\/or clinics with COVID-19. A cotton cloth mask with 2 or more layers is the next most reliable option. \u2063\n\u2063\nSurprisingly, the bandanas, neck fleece or gaiters didn\u2019t work well at all. These mask types did not stop the spread of particles. Instead, they were found to break down large droplets into smaller droplets that can linger in the air and spread more easily. \u2063\n\u2063\nThey also reported that N95 masks with valves may also spread the virus to others especially if the person is an asymptomatic carrier or has COVID-19.  The valve in front of the mask closes during inspiration.  But it opens during expiration allows the person to exhale infected respiratory droplets.  These masks protect the user but they definitely don\u2019t protect others nearby.\u2063\n \u2063\nWhat\u2019s the take home message? When going out, wear a mask that works. Your best option is a well-fitted cotton mask with 2 or more layers. \u2063\n\u2063\nAny questions? \u2063\n\u2063\n#wearamask #maskup\u2063","NumberOfLikes":232,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":89,"Timestamp":1597250225,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 12 18:37:05 CEST 2020","Location":"San Francisco, California"},{"CaptionText":"Team Sambal invited 10 identified households to one of its volunteer's house to handover the ration and basic hygiene kit. \nRation kit contains:\n\n10 Kgs of rice\n1.5 Kgs of pulses\n1 Kg salt\n1 L edible oil\n2 Kgs potatoes\n100g turmeric powder\n\nBasic hygiene kit contains:\n\n1 packet of detergent powder,¬†\n1 bar of bathing soap and¬†\n1 packet of sanitary napkins (wherever required)\n\nThank you ALL for the love and support.\n\nTogether we can feed more and do more for the people.\n\nDonate via this link - https:\/\/ketto.org\/s?id=FK9QXH39R (in bio)\n\nPaytm: +91-8486717282\n\nGoogle Pay: sujitmuktan.sm@okhdfcbank \/ +91-8486717282\n\n#pandemic #pandemic2020 #socialdistancing #life #covid19 #2020 #struggle #story #india #rural #village #community #survival #change #development #social #fundraiser #reachout #newnormal #poor #relief #work #workfromhome #jobs #igers #instagram #instadaily #instastory #instashare #distribution","NumberOfLikes":6,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§¨‡§≤ (Sambal) in Moran, Dibrugarh.

When they are about to cross the Red Sea and the Israelites can see Pharaoh\u2019s army coming for them and they are filled with fear. \u201CBut Moses told the people, \u201CDon\u2019t be afraid. Just stand still and watch the Lord rescue you today...The Lord himself will fight for you. Just stay calm.\u201D\u2014Exodus 14:13-14\n‚ú®\nAs we go through the rollercoaster that is 2020 these words feel as relevant today as they were thousands of years ago when Moses spoke them. The Lord WILL fight for you. He IS fighting for you already. All we have to do is ask.\n‚ú®\nI read an article this week about a survey recently conducted by the Pew Research Center that shows that 89% of Americans have turned to TV or movies to cope during the pandemic but only 3 out of every 10 US adults are reading the Bible at least weekly. More people are zoning out in front of the TV rather than turning to the Lord for help. So, I would like to encourage you to read your Bibles and spend time getting to know the Lord! Talk to him and ask for what you need! Even if you\u2019ve never prayed before, just start. If you have questions, ask Him. Allow Him to rescue you. We have access to the same God that parted the Red Sea and brought the Israelites out of slavery and into the Promised Land. Turning to Him should be our first reaction, not our last resort. ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\u201CAsk, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.\u201D\u2014Matthew 7:7","NumberOfLikes":12,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Maggie Rhodes on August 12, 2020.","NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1597237881,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 12 15:11:21 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Summer Sangria üç∑ #sangriaüç∑ #fennvalleywinery #localwines #summer #swingset #backyard #backyardliving #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife #winelover #wine #puremichigan #michiganwine #michigan #winetime","NumberOfLikes":9,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by LynniePins Photography in Gibson, Michigan.

I won\u2019t say I started to feel differently, because I am not different, #iam just like you, I am one of you. I #breathe the same air, my blood is red, and I feel and emote just like everyone of you. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nGrowing up I was told I was different, I was told how to act a certain way because that was what was considered normal for me as a boy to do. I still wonder who gives anyone the right to tell another #human being how to act, how to feel, who to love, who to have #sex with and how one should #live their life. I can #relate to consideration, care, protectiveness but what I find hard to swallow is an authoritarian approach, a \u201Cyou must do this in order to be normal and successful \u201D thought process. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nThat\u2019s why today when people ask the question - When did you come out of the closet, my answer to that is - You put me in the closet, I was never in one. You made me feel like I was different but I always considered myself to be one of you ! \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nWhat I would like to say most of all is that - You tried hard but I was never in a F****** closet. I am here,I have always been here and I will always be here. Deal with it because now you are the one that looks and feels different to me ! \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#androgynous #pride #happy #loveyourself #happinessisachoice #outloudandproud #pandemic2020 #quarantinethoughts","NumberOfLikes":121,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by KEAN ALVARES | ANDROGYNOUS in Mumbai, Maharashtra.

She rolls around on the concrete floor of her cage, pulling at tufts of hair in frustration, looking depressed, lonely and traumatised. We all know what it is like to be in lockdown but imagine that for 32 years. If there has ever been a time where we say enough is enough it must be now.\nSo please spread the word, the more people that know about this, the more we can save Bua Noi.
