Irritated. Frustrated. Triggered.\n\nAnd then I heard that your triggers are a reflection into yourself. \n\nI reflected on that and then decided it didn\u2019t pertain to THIS situation. 😂😂\n\nBut seriously, I was in denial.\n\nUntil it clicked! I had to ask myself \u201CWhere are you playing the victim in your own life?\u201D. Ahhhh, yeah, maybe there is something here.\n\nI was putting the responsibility to heal from my old trauma on other people. I expected those that hurt me to fix me. \n\nAnd I thought it made sense.\n\nUntil I realized that I am an adult and I am responsible for myself. And that includes my own healing. It is not anyone else\u2019s responsibility to heal old wounds. That\u2019s on me to heal.\n\nAnd when I finally accepted this, I began to take control of my healing. I stopped waiting for someone else to heal these wounds, and I started looking within.\n\nIn order to heal the way I needed to, I had to learn self awareness. I had to look inwardly with curiosity and without judgement. Observe my thoughts, feelings, and actions. And realize that I am NOT my feelings. Being able to separate myself from the outside world was the greatest self discovery I could ask for.\n\nSo take a look at what triggers or annoys you, and then ask yourself \u201CWhere in my life am I doing this action?\u201D And then look with curiosity and without judgement. \n\n#selflove #findyourself #pandemic2020 #selfgrowth #balance #justenough #personalgrowthanddevelopment #mindsetmatters #mindset #loveyourself #positivemindset #chooseyourlife #selfhealer #nurse #nursing #nurses #nursehealers","NumberOfLikes":7,"Hashtags":["#selflove","#findyourself","#pandemic2020","#selfgrowth","#balance","#justenough","#personalgrowthanddevelopment","#mindsetmatters","#mindset","#loveyourself","#positivemindset","#chooseyourlife","#selfhealer","#nurse","#nursing","#nurses","#nursehealers"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Erin | BSN | RN on August 11, 2020.

This is a community that is invested heavily in the tourism trade, despite its relatively remote location. Like other tourist destinations, Victoria reacted swiftly during the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic, recognizing the economic threat that loomed on the horizon. Gone are its massive cruise ships and international passengers; instead, the city is catering to local and regional Canadians seeking a homegrown experience rather than travelling abroad. \n\nTo improve social distancing, Government Street in Victoria's Old Town district has been closed to vehicle traffic, creating a new pedestrian mall that has seen cafés and restaurants spill into the street for safer al fresco dining. Tourist shops have devoted space to selling groceries and everyday essentials for locals and visitors, reducing the need to travel to larger supermarkets. The end result is a walkable, community-focused city that has some local officials pondering which changes can be made permanent beyond 2020. Although British Columbia was an early COVID-19 hotspot in Canada, diligent social distancing measures, hand washing and frequent mask usage have led to a dramatic drop in new cases - promising a swifter return to normalcy for this idyllic province.\n\nThis is the final part of our series that features Canadian communities from coast-to-coast-to-coast, highlighting their unique pandemic experiences.\n\nPhoto: Victoria, British Columbia\nCredit: Jasper Garratt\n\n#covid19 #covid #coronavirus #virus #pandemic #quarantine #quarantinelife #canada #transcanada #pandemic2020 #2020 #bc #britishcolumbia #victoria #victoriabc #yyj #vancouverisland #chinatown #urbanphotography #urban #oldtown #alley #canadian #street #streetphotography #citylife #cityphotography #cityscape #city #tourism","NumberOfLikes":19,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#covid","#coronavirus","#virus","#pandemic","#quarantine","#quarantinelife","#canada","#transcanada","#pandemic2020","#2020","#bc","#britishcolumbia","#victoria","#victoriabc","#yyj","#vancouverisland","#chinatown","#urbanphotography","#urban","#oldtown","#alley","#canadian","#street","#streetphotography","#citylife","#cityphotography","#cityscape","#city","#tourism"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Respondkits on August 10, 2020.

Eight months into 2020 and you have not only survived, but you overcame.\n\u2063\nMany times we underestimate our ability to overcome. We don\u2019t give ourselves enough credit for the mountains we\u2019ve climbed. This is why when we\u2019re faced with yet another mountain, we sometimes shrink back in fear forgetting that we\u2019ve been there and done that; and have the scars and strength to prove it. We\u2019re not just survivors, we\u2019re overcomers.\n\u2063\nRecently, I have felt like a small girl staring in the face of yet another giant, up against another big mountain praying consistently on how to conquer it and for directions to get to the top. Yet today, God reminded that He knows my name. He knows my needs. He has the plans and strategy. \n\u2063\nAs with the people of Israel, He\u2019ll lead us to our promised land, but He doesn\u2019t promise that the path will always be easy.

August is all about working with those dusty corners of our psyche, ones we thought were tucked deeply enough away to quietly ignore. The time has come for our own personal liberation. Mars in Aries square to Pluto in Capricorn. I\u2019m going keep talking about this theme for the whole month. Mars = the body, action, how we FIGHT for and with people. Pluto = death and rebirth, wealth, shadow, the underworld, power, control, compulsion. If you\u2019ve been paying attention you\u2019ll remember that squares are areas of tension in astrology.  We have reached a face off between Mars and Pluto. The moon in Taurus today also adds stubbornness and resistance to change. If you feel resistant to engaging with your shadow or if you feel overwhelmed by the task of it, how can you transform that energy? You are never without agency unless you allow that. Engage with shadow to make room for light.

No Man\u2019s Land has been on pause for the last few months, mainly because of Covid-19 and the havoc it inflicts on creativity, productivity, and the brain, as I\u2019m sure many of you can relate to. I haven\u2019t been idle though. \n\nI\u2019ve been doing some freelance editing and working on a big, thrilling, scary project with @joshuakemble. I hope to be able to share more about that at some point. \n\nI\u2019m proud that NoMansLand.blog will mark its 3rd anniversary at the end of August. There\u2019s still plenty of geek-related content there for you to enjoy, including interviews with a diverse group of geeky women to follow and support. Link to the blog in my bio.\n\n3. I continue to work with @templeofgeek and @templeofgeekchic. Our focus right now is on supporting small geek fashion businesses, especially Black-owned brands and shops. I\u2019m grateful for this team of talented creators. \n\n4. Because I live in LA County, which has been hit hard by Covid-19, my family and I continue to stay at home and social distance in a strict way (it\u2019s been about 5 months now) because we know it\u2019s the right thing to do. Sometimes it seems like we\u2019re the only ones doing it, but I know that\u2019s not true. I see the rest of you and I appreciate what you\u2019re doing! \n\n5. I\u2019ve also been spending a lot of time figuring out how I can best support the Black Lives Matter movement and actively work for social justice and to dismantle white supremacy.\n\nTo wrap it up, in the midst of all the pandemic madness, I continually find joy in the geek and fandom communities. So many of you are making difficult sacrifices and smart decisions to protect and help others. You\u2019re also finding ways to make, create, share, uplift, take action, find humor, and thoughtfully engage at a time when this is not easy but desperately needed. As always, but especially now, I\u2019m inspired by you.

It's been five months of learning a new world, navigating uncertainties, exploring new innovations with technology, dreaming about possibilities, understanding our ever-changing emotions, embracing relationships, and practicing what we value most.\n\nNow that we are at 150 days, let's talk about energy and enjoyment. Yes, having fun looks a little different, but that doesn't mean we can't enjoy ourselves while still feeling connected.\n\nRecently, the hubsters and I have had some opportunities to get creative with our time. Last week, we took a stroll downtown as we ordered food to go. To say I felt human again walking along High Street in the Short North of Columbus was an understatement. It was refreshing to see people out and about, saying hi to each other, and enjoying what was of that day.

Have you been coping emotionally through this pandemic or are beginning to feel a little (or a lot) low? I don\u2019t think anyone can say that they have felt 100% during the last five months, no matter how well they adapt to change, exercise, meditate and do all the other things we often talk about to reduce stress. \n\nThe fact is that life is hard right now and in these times it is very easy to focus all our attention on surviving in the now. Adapting, protecting, getting angry with the politics on both sides as well as trying to ensure we can put food on the table. It is easy to not put any focus on our emotional and mental state. \n\nSo hopefully this will be a little reminder to stop or at least reduce the things that are flaring up your stress and anger; and thereby finding a few mins in your day to bring your journey inward. To breathe and find inner call. \n\nLook after yourself.

Schools closed, distance learning... for now, everything has changed. \nWe attempted distance learning, for us it was a lot of computer time, YouTube videos and exploring and practicing letters.  We observed our children, and watched which learning activities worked for our son (and by default his sisters) and which activities could start a toddler riot over YouTube 🤦🏻\u200D♀️. We took pictures, videos and patiently (or not so patient...) worked on the computer based learning with our son.

And it looks like Apple's contract manufacturers are getting more serious about shifting their facilities from China to India.\n.\n.\n.\nThe sources in the matter claim that the establishment of the facility could provide employment to around 55,000 Indian workers in just a matter of a year. Moreover, the venders aint simply looking to make only smartphones, but also shift to manufacturing laptop, tablets and other computers in the next few years.\n.\n.\n.\nThis could mean that Ipads, Macbooks and even IMacs could get a whole lot cheaper for buyers in India as now Apple won't have to pay hefty taxes to import the products in India.\n.\n.\n.\n#india #applewatch #apple #shotoniphone #giveawayiphone #imac #imacpro #usa🇺🇸 #laptop #iphone11 #china #thailand #vietnam #smartphone #smartphonephotography #coronavírus #macbookpro #watch #apple #indiajobs #indiafightscorona #market #pandemic2020 #economy #jobsearch","NumberOfLikes":20,"Hashtags":["#india","#applewatch","#apple","#shotoniphone","#giveawayiphone","#imac","#imacpro","#usa🇺🇸","#laptop","#iphone11","#china","#thailand","#vietnam","#smartphone","#smartphonephotography","#coronavírus","#macbookpro","#watch","#apple","#indiajobs","#indiafightscorona","#market","#pandemic2020","#economy","#jobsearch"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The Voice Of Millions on August 09, 2020.
