Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone of the Rama Temple in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh, on 05 August, months after India's Supreme Court ruled that the site should be given to Hindus after a dispute concerning the control of the area, regarded as the birthplace of Lord Rama. The site had previously hosted the Babri Masjid, a mosque destroyed by Hindu nationalists in 1992. The courts also ruled that Muslim devotees would be assigned a separate lot to rebuild the mosque. #epaphotos #epidemic #lockdown #Delhi #indiagram #delhigram #delhites #IndiaDaily #india_everyday #india_photography #india_pictures #delhiscenes #delhiblog #coronavirus #corona #pandemic2020 #coronavirus #lockdown2020 #measure #precautions #prevention #coronasafety  #newworld #ram #ayodhyarammandir #ayodhya #lordram # @epaphotos","NumberOfLikes":118,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1596653436,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 05 20:50:36 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Toilet paper, flour, yeast just some of things people panic bought when this  pandemic hit North America.

Trust me when I say... I know these times are hard and uncertain. I\u2019ve been living in a hard, uncertain season for almost 3 years now but this pandemic was the cherry on top. Everything changed so quickly, the gyms closed, I couldn\u2019t work with my clients or hold my bootcamps. Everything at home also changed and not to mention the fact that I have an immunocompromised son. I was letting fear take over and turned to comfort food( meaning junk food) which I don\u2019t normally eat.  I figured - why not? Were in a pandemic and who knows what can happen next?! I was still working out because that\u2019s very therapeutic for me, but we all know you can\u2019t outwork a bad diet.  I was starting to feel sluggish, the anxiety that I had been working on controlling for years was making its way back, I was struggling during my workouts and my clothes wasn\u2019t fitting right anymore. In mid April, I sat down and put my ass on check.  First of all, reminding myself that faith over fear always. Telling myself that this is not the time to fall into bad habits. This is the time to get your health at its best.  Cleaned up my diet, researched the best supplements for me, worked on my mental health daily and got on a workout plan again.  I\u2019ve lost weight, yes - but knowing that my mind and body are much happier and healthier now is what really matters!  I still have more progress to make but I\u2019m feeling so much better and refuse to let this pandemic control my well being. 💪🏼🙌🏼 Move your body, feed your body foods that nourish it and change your mindset!

A beautiful, south Asian mother that took her life because of postpartum depression.\n\nFor far too long there has been a stigma about mental health and the open discussion of seeking care for mental health issues in the south Asian community. And even worse, openly talking about it.\n\nThis women lost her life because of that societal stigma.\n\nThis family lost a wife, a mother, a daughter.\n\nThey lost her far too soon.\n\nPlease remember her face. Remember the face of a smiling women who was suffering inside.\nAnd then go ask a friend who had a child if they are doing ok. Don\u2019t just ask about her baby - ask HER if she is ok. We must collectively increase our awareness and our action to prevent more innocent lives from falling victim to this all to common disease.\n\n#breakthestigma4nima #ppd #postpartumdepression #postpartum #postpartumjourney #pregnancy #mentalhealth #motherhood #motherhoodunplugged #mentalhealthawareness #depression #womensupportingwomen","NumberOfLikes":751,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":99,"Timestamp":1596644496,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 05 18:21:36 CEST 2020","Location":"Washington D.C."},{"CaptionText":"When your home unit turns into the medical COVID unit two weeks before your last day 😷 if I can wear full PPE and an N95 mask for 12 hours you can wear a mask at the store #oncologynurse #medsurgnurse #registerednurse #bsn #covidunit #frontlineworkers #essentialworkers #wearthedamnmask #stayhome #pandemic2020 #pandemicnurse","NumberOfLikes":41,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Stephanie BSN, RN on August 05, 2020.

That's one of the reasons the land is so cheap out there even though it's only fifteen miles or so from town. Electric and phone lines do not extend out beyond the gorge. Most people don't have building permits. If you need the police or fire department, you're most likely out of luck. You're on your own out there on the west mesa. Because of this, a rugged community of outliers has sprung up, willing to live off grid. Think Mad Max Beyond the Thunderdome meets a hippie commune crossed with a libertarian militia.\n\nAs I mentioned in the last blog post, we have become jaded about mortgages. But when we were thinking we wanted to buy land, we knew we didn't have enough money to do it without getting a bank loan. I was struggling quite a bit with my integrity versus my reality. This is a struggle most of us have everyday, especially environmentalist. Every time we get in our car or buy plastic products produced in China, we are choosing between integrity and reality. I was ready to give up and get a bank loan.\n\nWe were on the way home from our Spring Break road trip in southern New Mexico when we learned that the first cases of the Corona Virus had made it to our state and a shelter-in-place order would be quickly enacted by our governor. Listening to the news on the radio, I turned to Eric and said, \"If the apocalypse happens while we're living in our current house in town, I'm going to be so pissed.\" It's funny, but I was half-serious. All the years I had been homesteading and living in fairly independent conditions up until most recently, and this would be the moment when everything collapses? Fortunately, nothing collapsed, but it made me realize how truly important it was for me to make a change.\nRead more...link in bio...\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#pandemic2020 #quarantinelife #quarantine #shelterinplace #covid_19 #coronavirus #desertvibes #desertlife #riogrande #taos #NewMexico #offgrid #offgridhome #tinyhome #apacolypse #debtfreejourney #mortgagefreehome #environmentalist #ecofeminist #conservation #sustainableliving","NumberOfLikes":10,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Johanna DeBiase in Rio Grande del Norte National Monument.

Busyet padahal pahit banget jadi gak tega. Kedua dikasih biji maoni itu juga paitnya minta ampun tapi masih gak mempan juga. \n\nDikasih brotowali, maoni + plus lipmatte warna merah darah. \n\nDoi tetep masih mau \n\nTerus bertekat bener2 gak dikasih sampe 2 hari, dan cuma berdua sama andra gak ada yg bantuin karena pasti saat menyapih anak rewel karena gak bisa tidur dan bla bla \n\nSaking stressnya akhirnya menyerah dan dikasihkan lagi. \n\n1\/2 minggu setelah bala bantuan datang hehehe memutuskan menyapih lagi tanpa dikasih apa2 \n\nAku pergi seharian, si anak sama kakung utinya maen-maen dan akhirnya lupa. Kalo inget di gendong sama kakung\/utinya. Yg jelas gak sama aku. Hehehe \n\nSeminggu berhasil. Si andra lupa dan bisa bobo sendiri tanpa rewel. \n\nAkupun gak ada drama bengkak, demam dan sakit kayak orang-orang bilang. Alhamdulillah.\n\nMungkin karena semua udah siap.

Setelah sebulan udah berkurang jadi 5 kotak sehari. \n\nIni lagi masa pengurangan susu kotak cukup sehari 2-3 kotak aja. \n\nMenurut aku menyapih itu penting demi kebaikan anak biar bisa menenangkan dirinya sendiri saat ngambek, rewel dan gak bisa tidur. \n.\n.\n.\nPRnya lagi berhenti pake popok 💪💪💪\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n#myfamily #mylove #lfl #pandemic2020 #love #lfl💛 #family #kikydiary #newnormal #pantaimarina  #ootdfamily #ootdhijab #diaryandra #momnson #dramamenyapih #menyapih","NumberOfLikes":318,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Kiky Saky | Nasa Leader on August 05, 2020 tagging @babyandradiary.

However, Senate Republicans apparently have scrapped that idea.\u2063\n\u2063\nWhat do Democrats say?\u2063\n\u2063\nRepublicans and Democrats agree that the second stimulus check should be $1,200. However, Democrats have called for $1,200 second stimulus checks for dependents (compared to $500 under the Republicans proposal), up to a maximum of three dependents. Some Democrats also wanted $2,000 a month second stimulus checks. However, Democrats likely will compromise on a one-time stimulus check, rather than monthly stimulus checks.\u2063\n\u2063\n- Forbes","NumberOfLikes":4,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by PhenomenalKeesh on July 28, 2020.

With limited water service, washing hands frequently was not almost a luxury.  With limited space inside and the zinc roof protecting from fierce sunlight, staying at home was not always an option. Thiago decided to partner with his brother to keep the community disinfected to reduce contamination from the virus.  It was no easy feat!\n\nHe had to budget for the initiative - to protect him and his brother with appropriate gear, to procure the chemical used for disinfecting and other necessary measures.  Thiago was unstoppable and he \nmanaged to figure out all of these and started his Disinfection Project.\n\nThiago, his brother and a team of volunteers, go up and down the Santa Maria Hill,  twice a week,  spraying disinfectant and the residents don't miss to cheer them! He hopes his effort will inspire others too and help them serve their community.❤️\n\nWe sure hope the same!

The answers did much more than increase my knowledge, they stirred my inquisitiveness even more and I decided to dive deeper into this by pursuing a formal education in the field of science (B.sc, psychology, nutrition science) .\nOn this journey, I also came across a variety of mind-body therapies that though lacked some kind of scientific validation had astonishing impact on the human behaviour. This further led me to explore the whole new dimension that existed & yet was being questioned about its existence.\nThe knowledge I gained from these spiritual therapies helped me have an integrated approach towards restoring to health the mind, body & spirit along with its applications practically, emotionally & logically all at the same time.\n Covid19 pandemic - one of its kind, is a huge crisis at all levels.  Now more than ever we see the effects of environment on human mind and body more profoundly. Emotions and feelings have always been relinquished in our society. Though everyone is privy to it, we simply disregard them for the fear of being judged or abandoned by the society & our loved ones.\nThe big question is what happens to it then? Where does it all go? How does it affect? Who all does it affect? why importance is given to only our body & not our mind? \n\"The Whole Me\"  an online wellness portal, postulates EFT, hypnosis, & other psychological & spiritual techniques to transform the way our mind & body copes with this stress, so your performance, productivity & creativity all increases. \nTherapy sessions at \"The Whole ME\" catering to all age groups - help you come out more stronger, clearer headed and  confident restoring your health & wellness, apart from this it also helps in \nSleep regularisation\nConscious parenting\nRelationship management\nAddictions & behavioural changes\nPersonality building & networking\nLifestyle adaptation & a lot more.\nPh- 9819046111","NumberOfLikes":8,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The Whole ME on August 04, 2020.","NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1596537175,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 04 12:32:55 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷 Continue to wear your mask.

They may feel like they can\u2019t breathe but they are breathing. For anyone with mask anxiety, start wearing it at home for short periods to get used to wearing it. The more that you wear it and tell yourself that you are ok, the more comfortable you will feel when you have to wear a mask.

Hope everyone is doing good health wise and wealth wise also  everyone is staying safe. \n❤️\n❤️\nLife has changed so much with this pandemic. In a good ways also in a bad ways.We never got time for near or dear ones.Always hustle hustle and hustle . We never enjoyed eating food rather just gulp it down. We wished if we could stop time . Guess what !! time stood still and we started complaining.\n✨\n✨\nInstagram became a new reality show. People started working on their hobbies which is good you know.But there are also people who lost their jobs because they couldn\u2019t work from home .There were also people who were forced to work. There were people who loved staying home, there were also people who would risk everything to go out have a beach day without caring about consequences.There are also people who were scared to come home in fear that they would put their family at risk. The list goes on and on and on. \n💫\n💫\nEveryone\u2019s journey is not the same. Everyone is trying to get adjusted to new normal.Specially homemakers,stay home moms,working moms,single dads and dads who stepped up to help their spouses. Please please please do support them whichever way possible. Just a simple call,just a text message or just a drive by hi.Trust me it would do  wonders.\n👐\n👐\nGiving air hugs to each and everyone. You guys are awesome be in that way . Pray for everyone\u2019s safety. Though this click was not staged not meant to be on my feed but when I saw Kai putting all his effort to reach the glass of juice and he succeeded too , couldn\u2019t resist myself from posting this . If he can try fail try fail try why can\u2019t we . Nothing is end of the world . We are smart we can figure out something . In this tough time healthy mental health utmost important. Hope and pray we all are working in that direction.\n❤️\n❤️\n#mentalhealthawareness #pandemic2020 #mentalhealth #mentalhealthmatters #healthheroes #covid19 #stayhome #staysafe #instadaily #instagram #instagood #thoughtoftheday #thought #standtogether #togetherwearestronger #togetherwestand #standwithhumanity #helpsmallbusinesses #neighborhood","NumberOfLikes":168,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by DrSwati Amrit Biswal in Dublin, California with @dolphia.nandi, @amritpatra86, @thefoodieresearcher, @rupalipatra, @shrutimohanty, @smrutipattnaik, @aroma_portraits, @abimilano, @bellydriven, @maddy_is_trying, @globaldaawat, @spiceathon, @littlechefchika, @laviextraordinaire, @yoursplatefully, @soul_travellers27, and @oh_dish_aaha.

Medical expenses\n2. Repair expenses\n.\nIt is obvious that we end up spending lot of money from our savings since we haven't segregated some money for these expenses during budget.\n.\nFirstly, it is important to include this during budget even though it's probability is low.\nBut, we'll see how can we minimise the impact of this immediate expense.\n-\n1. Warranty\/AMC certificates:\n Most of us don't keep the paperworks of a gadget safely. But during these repair moments those paperworks can be very handy in reducing few bucks from the repair costs. So, start filing all of your bills and documents.\n\n2. Family Medical Insurance:\n We can't avoid medical expenses, and it is impossible to predict. We are ageing and our parents have grown old, so the need for money for medical increases exponentially. Most of us are covered by insurance by our corporates, but still it is important to read it's benefits completely.\n\n3. Negotiation:\n It is a whole topic by itself. If you are still among the few people who shop offline, there is high chance for negotiation. Most of the dealers sell products at prices which includes EMI. If you are buying without EMI, you can cut down atleast 10% of the price. Learn the art of Negotiation.\n-\nThese will really help you when you start being financially independent.\n.\n.\n#financialfreedom #financialliteracy #finance #expensetracker #savings #moneysaver #insurance #negotiation #negotiationskills #unexpectedexpenses #medicalexpenses #repair #budgeting #warranty #amc #pandemic2020 #90skid #piggybank #moneymakemoremoney #moneymotivation #bewise #moneybasics #90s #90smemes #90skids #pricecut #emi #sales #infomemes #omniscience","NumberOfLikes":21,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by OmniSaint on August 03, 2020.

If one thousand people were sick one day and another two thousand were sick the next, that equates to three thousand people being sick. So why are people debating the numbers? When did the logic stop?\n\nThe pandemic is devastating.\n\nOver 150,000 lives lost. Children losing parents, wives losing husbands, and heartbreakingly true: parents losing their children. How can you compare your experience with theirs? How does anyone know the pain and severity of this virus if you were not put in that situation of having to say good-bye? Of having to be told you are not allowed to say good-bye?\n\nThe pandemic is loud.\n\nNurses and doctors working all hours to save their patients. The beeping of machines in the hospital. But also the New Yorkers who made noise and banged pots and pans every night for the first responders. Did you forget about them yet? Or worse, did you forget about the doctors because it doesn\u2019t affect you directly?\n\nThe pandemic is destructive.\n\nMillions were left unemployed, searching for their next job, their next paycheck. The coronavirus did not care where you lived or how old you were. We were truly all vulnerable. This pandemic rolled into our lives and destroyed as much as it could on its way.\n\nThe pandemic is vincible.\n\nIt will not win. We will find a cure. We will find treatments. We will return to work. Children will return to school life will go on. This will not last.\n\nThe pandemic is temporary.\n\nRemember, if you are reading this, you are alive. You have today, and hopefully tomorrow. The days of the coronavirus are numbered. So stay home if you can, wear your masks, and one day, sit with your families at the holidays, and say, \u201CRemember the pandemic of 2020?\u201D\n\n#pandemic #pandemic2020 #coronavirus #wearyourmask #strongertogether #writing #writingcommunity #keepgoing","NumberOfLikes":3,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Kristen Dutkiewicz on August 03, 2020.

I was going to just let it go and take a break from it. But, maybe that\u2019s not the answer. Maybe I should explain. \n\nYou see- some of us are still out here worrying about a pandemic. Worrying about getting exposed. Worried about infecting our loved ones. Worrying for our patients. Worrying about the fall and winter hospital capacity. Trying to ignore the recruiting emails to go to Texas and Florida to work 70 hour weeks because they are so desperate. \n\nYou see- some of us are still wearing masks for 8-12 hours straight and not eating or drinking on shift. I was running around the department on my last overnight shift and finally reached a point where I started dry heaving. I went in the doc box, ripped off the mask and took 30 seconds to catch my breath and then I put the mask back on and put a chest tube in someone at 4AM. \n\nYou see- that patient I was worried about dying? The one who looked me in the eyes before I intubated him and was terrified? He did die. Took awhile. But he\u2019s gone now. Just like I thought he would be. He wasn\u2019t the only patient I lost these past few months from COVID. \n\nYou see- we had an entire family line up outside of the ambulance bay to see their intubated loved one be transferred to another hospital. They hadn\u2019t seen him in a month. \n\nYou see- every black patient I\u2019ve encountered in the last few months I\u2019ve been especially worried about how to protect them and be the best healthcare advocate I can for them because the truth is it took a civil rights movement to remind me that their lives matter just as much as white lives. That\u2019s the truth. I wasn\u2019t advocating equally even if I thought I was. \n\nYou see- every time I tell someone how I\u2019m really doing or what\u2019s really on my mind I can see the uncomfortable look on their face, shifting their weight while looking for the fastest way out of the conversation. \n\nContinued in the comments","NumberOfLikes":51,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1596509275,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 04 04:47:55 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#DailyUpdates #currentevents #currentaffairs #morning #follow #goodday #bless #love #life #India #hindustan #bharat #covid19 #lockdown2020 #pandemic2020 #narendramodi_primeminister #Post #Update #family #frndz #motivation\n\nFollow👇👇\n@knowledge_bank26 \nFollow👆👆","NumberOfLikes":15,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by knowledge_bank on August 03, 2020.

I am going to get my associates in graphic design. Ten years ago, before I graduated with my bachelors, I started working for adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. I found not only did I enjoy the work, but I was good at what I did. I had no idea what I was going to do with my sociology degree or life, so I stuck with that. Ten years later, I\u2019ve done direct care, case management, ran a group home, ran a day program, obtained my CNA license and countless de-escalation and physical intervention certificates. I\u2019ve worked for dozens of people with I\/DD and I\u2019ve really loved them. But, it\u2019s time for me to move on. The pandemic allowed me time off to think about what my next steps are. I landed on graphic design, and I\u2019m really happy with my choice,  and happy to be starting school for it. If you are a graphic designer, tell me so I can consult with you on my homework lol.\n.\nOutside of this exciting thing, I have been fighting against a raging bout of depression. It has knocked me on my ass. If I have never texted you back, or replied to your DMs, that\u2019s why. Every area in my life hurts (except my relationship). It\u2019s bad when the depression tells me: \u2018don\u2019t do the things you like doing, because you don\u2019t want to feel good.\u2019 For example, I can barely post memes, the thing that makes me so happy because it makes you all happy. I know the depression will pass. But if you wanted to send me nudes and\/or memes until then, please do.\n.\nYou are all the best and I miss art shows and you and normal life. I\u2019m feeling really, really isolated these days. Although I know being safe is for the best, it doesn\u2019t make it easier. Just do the things so we can do the normal things again soon.\n.\n.\n#sendnudes #sendmemes #sendboth #art #artist #denver #denverartist #denverarts #mentalhealth #mentalhealthawarness #depression #depressionkitty #whoevenreadshashtags #denverco #anxiety #pandemic2020 #stupidpandemic #pandemic #isolation #selfcare #goingbacktoschool #goingtobeacollegekidagain #college2.0 #studentloanlife #paymydebt #venmome13k #schoollife #collegeduringapandemic #coolstorybro #graphicdesign","NumberOfLikes":65,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":30,"Timestamp":1596508503,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 04 04:35:03 CEST 2020","Location":"Denver, Colorado"},{"CaptionText":"#sahm #workingmoms #homeschool #homeschooling #parenting #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":5,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by TheAdorkableMama on August 03, 2020.

Everywhere I turn people are having PTSD from the last real estate crash and think that because the US economy is in a recession that naturally the real estate market is too, but that is NOT the case. In dense cities like New York and San Francisco there is a decline in some sectors of real estate due to people wanting to be further away from others as a way to prevent catching COVID. In Arizona we are not such a walkable city and we are actually seeing a lot of people relocating here. Therefor we have an increase in the demand for housing and a decrease in people leaving or selling. As you can see on this graph from the @cromfordreport the last real estate crash had an over supply of houses from developers over building which is why the market was hit so badly in Phoenix. In order to see prices begin to decrease we would need to move into a buyers market meaning supply will be greater than demand. We are so far from there being a surplus of houses on the market to drive down prices that buyers do not need to worry about a crash any time soon. Of course no one could have predicted that we would be living through a pandemic right now so anything is possible but there\u2019s no data to cause alarm of properties in Phoenix losing value soon.\nThank you to @securitytitle for providing this access to the Cromford Report. This is giving the realtors who attend amazing insights into the market and economy. \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#realestate #realestateeconomics #economics #cromfordreport #securitytitle #realtoreducation #clienteducation #phoenixrealestate #phoenixrealtor #realestatepandemic2020 #realestate2020 #phoenixrealestate2020 #pandemic2020 #investor #investorlife #investorlifestyle","NumberOfLikes":11,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Morgan Heidinger in Phoenix, Arizona.
