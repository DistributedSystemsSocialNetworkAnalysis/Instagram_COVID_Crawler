But prayer is much different when done with a community, in a Holy Mass, amidst the serenity of a holy place. Before, we could even afford to miss this holy obligation. But suddenly, after months of deprivation, we miss that kind of worship, the Holy Eucharist, the echoing words of wisdom. We miss this kind of communion with God. Suddenly, we just can\u2019t wait to step inside a church again.\n\nIn this lyric essay, Sisang Batute expresses her deep yearning for this, particularly for the Holy Eucharist.

Ook niet een gezonde leefstijl. De beste manier om te voorkomen dat u het virus oploopt werd in de vorige post behandeld (houd je aan de maatregelen).\n \nMaar er is steeds meer bekend over het belang van een gezonde leefstijl en de gezondheidswinst die daarbij hoort. U loopt minder risico om ziek te worden als u een gezonde leefstijl heeft. Dit geldt niet alleen voor COVID19, maar ook voor een scala aan andere ziektebeelden. Er valt veel voor te zeggen om juist nu goed voor uzelf te zorgen. Onderdeel daarvan is: gezonde voeding, voldoende beweging en slaap, sociale verbinding, zingeving en ontspanning (niet te veel stress en angst).\n \nOok hier geldt gezond verstand.

On a personal quest to turn New Jersey\u2019s Pinelands National Reserve into a National Monument, Joy discusses setting up cameras to watch snake dens, as The Chrises encourage her to capture the Jersey Devil. With still so much more to learn about public land management, Joy suggests some low cost ways to upgrade urban planning\u2014 including permeable sidewalk pavers to replenish its natural aqueducts with rain water. Joy addresses listener questions about the waste produced from plastic vs. reusable water bottles, and how the @Guppyfriend prevents microplastic pollution that results from laundering synthetic garments. The Eco-Inspiration To All talks about the upcoming Marketplace Of The Future, an innovative, interactive, and Zelda-esque World Fair of Tomorrow. Last but not least, Joy encourages everyone to do tiny, little things to make big changes such as buying reusable and compostable products from @PackageFreeShop, and repurposing grocery vegetable bags to cover and store food.\n\n🌏 Special Guest: Joy Morgan, @joytotheworldmorgan\n🤲 Community Cause of the Week: Save The Waves, @savethewavescoalition\n🥛 Sponsor of the Day: Ball Canning Mason Jars, @ballcanning","NumberOfLikes":23,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598489774,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 27 02:56:14 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Keep Working Even Though The Covid Strikes.\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n😷 #Quarantine #ncov2019 #fightvirus #coronavirus #CoronavirusOutbreak #toptags #covid19 #QuarantineLife #Quarantined #stayinside #socialdistancing #socialdistance #SelfQuarantine #QuarantineAndChill #stayingin #stayingathome #staytogether #staysafe #fighttogether #stayhome #QuarantineSurvival #staypositive #coronamemes #happyathome #care","NumberOfLikes":21,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Fauzan Muhammad Nugraha in Bandung with @kopimantapabc, and @fauzan_nugraha0.

After COVID-19 series is all about staying physically apart. \u2063\n\u2063\nWe understand not all jobs can be completed from home.

𝐒𝐞𝐭 𝐮𝐩 𝐚𝐧 𝐈𝐧𝐟𝐥𝐨𝐰 𝐏𝐥𝐚𝐧 - To avoid staff and customers crossing paths, place directional arrows and signs to direct people to stay on the left vs right side, and to designate doors for entry and exit.\u2063\n\u2063\n𝟐. 𝐑𝐞𝐯𝐢𝐞𝐰 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐨𝐧 𝐀𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝗪𝐨𝐫𝐤 𝐒𝐩𝐚𝐜𝐞 - Kitchen, Cafeteria, Elecators, Stairways, and Washrooms can experience congestion throughout the day. It\u2019s important to implement social distancing, one way directional paths, and a fixed occupancy limit in each space with a thorough cleaning schedule. For work spaces, make sure everyone is 2 meters apart at all times. Space out desks or stagger shifts.\u2063\n\u2063\n𝟑. 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐠𝐠𝐞𝐫 𝐒𝐡𝐢𝐟𝐭𝐬 & 𝐋𝐮𝐧𝐜𝐡 𝐁𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐤𝐬 - Staggering shifts can greatly reduce congestion in common spaces, and lack of personal space in day to day work areas. It also helps reduce employees risk on public transit during peak hours. Assigning lunch break times to various areas of the workplace will keep social distancing and capacity under control. \u2063\n\u2063\n𝟒. 𝐀𝐯𝐨𝐢𝐝 𝐋𝐚𝐫𝐠𝐞 𝐆𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬 - Do not have large boardroom meetings, parties or get togethers at any time. \u2063If you must, maintain social distance and wear masks.\n\u2063\n𝟓. 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐏𝐥𝐞𝐱𝐢𝐠𝐥𝐚𝐬𝐬 𝐁𝐚𝐫𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐫𝐬 𝗪𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐍𝐞𝐞𝐝𝐞𝐝 - This is especially handy if you work face to face with customers, or cannot properly social distance at work. \u2063\n\u2063\n𝟔. 𝐒𝐞𝐞 𝐂𝐥𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬 𝐁𝐲 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐎𝐧𝐥𝐲 - Only see clients face to face if this is essential. If you must see clients, schedule appointments in advance. Do not allow walk ins.\u2063\n \u2063\n𝟕. 𝐎𝐩𝐭 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐮𝐞𝐝 𝐑𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐭𝐞 𝗪𝐨𝐫𝐤 - If most of your staff can complete their duties at home, continue to encourage remote working as much as possible. \n\n#covid19 #socialdistance #togetherapart #backtowork #backtoschool","NumberOfLikes":16,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by GOOD SENSE GROUP on August 26, 2020.
