Kennedy High School (JFKHS), Okkodo High School (OHS), and two COVID-19 cases were identified at the GDOE headquarters in Tiyan. \n\nOn Wednesday, August 26, 2020, the GDOE confirmed that four additional employees tested positive for COVID-19. Three of the four were identified through contact tracing. The contact tracing effort is ongoing and close contacts of the confirmed cases will be contacted directly by DPHSS. \n\nA close contact is an individual who has come in face-to-face contact with a confirmed COVID-19 individual for at least 10 minutes or more and within six feet, or who has had direct contact with infectious secretions of the confirmed COVID-19 individual (e.g. being coughed on). \n\nAreas of the school campuses and GDOE district office have been identified for cleaning and disinfecting. Under the current executive order, GDOE employees are teleworking and will not have access to these areas until cleaning has been completed.\n\nFor the latest information on COVID-19, visit dphss.guam.gov or guamrecovery.com.

We called Agapé Hospice on a Friday, and within 30 minutes of our call a social worker came to our house, interviewed us and evaluated mom\u2019s needs and put a plan into place immediately. Within 2 hours a hospital bed, oxygen, and medications were delivered to our house. Within 4 hours a nurse had come to check on mom and to help answer any questions we had. The next day a doctor came to meet and evaluate mom and to assure us that we were doing everything we could. I can\u2019t say enough nice things about Agapé\u2019s services and support.

It's never too late to learn sumpmm new! \nAlso, the key that I've decided to play it in gives me the opportunity to really focus on my breath support and F natural placement, which has always been my dreaded break point.

I know that guy! i used to see him at Dizzy's!\"\nThis song, co-written by \"that guy\" Brian Elmquist, has always struck a chord with me and its my pleasure to jam it out for yall.\nI encourage yall to look up these folks!! \n\nThank you so much for the tunes, TLB.

Firstly, if you were to ask me what my number one life song would be, i'd probably answer with this. I don't know if it's because I'm the youngest in my family or because, living in NYC, I'm so far away from home or what, but this song tackles a subject that's universally known and individually felt; that growing up and dealing with the things life throws at us are things that none of us ever really feel ready for. Life doesn't always wait for you to be done reveling in moments of achievement or dwelling in heartache. It's already moved on without you. That's really scary to me. And now, more than ever, I'm dying to press that pause button. Pull the emergency break. Let me catch my breath. \n\nSecondly, the composition of this song will ALWAYS be challenging for me to execute. I learned this song in high school and still can't nail it the way I want to, but I love that about this song. The consistent plucking of a melody crafted to barely emulate the cadence of a train whistle, the \"chugga-chugga\"-esque foundation in the tempo... paired with a lyrical melody that mostly stays right in the break of my voice. I LOVE having this song to practice with and train my muscles to glide through from chest to head to falsetto. Over the years, this song has proven to be quite a useful tool. \n\nThirdly, I'm learning to be ok with sharing less than stellar takes. In this video you'll hear background coughs, outside traffic, water pipes in the walls, my voice struggling to make it through the break, struggling with breath control, buzzy notes from the strings, falling off tempo while trying to balance all these things.... you're not about to see a performance, this is a window into my practice time. \nThis video has so many \"gritty flubs\" (dibs on that band name) that it rings that perfect tone of honesty for a song such as this. \n\nHey, we can't all be as smooth as johnny may may, josh meyers, Jonathan Mayernaise, @johnmayer\n\n#stopthistrain #johnmayer #immilesfromhome #milesfromhome #quarantine #socialdistance #day17 #nycmusicians #brooklynmusicians #scaredofgettingold","NumberOfLikes":7,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598421711,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 26 08:01:51 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"The first song on one of my all-time favorite  albums, the Garden State Soundtrack.\nThe pandemic we're all facing together worldwide and the positive effects our social distancing has been having on the environment in general made me think of this song. I had a wonderful moment of reflection while learning this one.\nWhile right now it seems \"all of us are done for\" it's so important to remember that \"everybody here has somebody to lean on.\" \nIf you need someone and can't find someone (Don't Panic, you will), I'll be that someone. We will come out stronger on the other side.

In April 2020, Hispanic-Americans had the highest unemployment rate at 18.9%, compared to 16.7% of Blacks, 14.5% of Asians, and 14.2% of whites. Additionally, the rate for women was higher than the rate for men, with 15.5% of women unemployed in April as opposed to 13% of men. Educational attainment is also an indicator for job loss; people without a high school diploma experienced an unemployment rate of 21.2%, compared to 8.4% for those with a bachelor's degree.

It is not inherited. And oftentimes, greatness isn't appreciated or recognised until you see greatness anywhere no more\u2063.\n\u2063\n🤫The secret of greatness lies within you. There is no discrimination from God. Anybody can be great. You have the formula of greatness inside you. It depends on you if you want to be great. If you want to be great, you can be great.\u2063\n\u2063\nThat secret recipe of greatness is inside you. There are so many souls inside you. Nothing is out of your reach. When you reach God, you will be at the pinnacle of your journey. That is the culmination.\u2063\n\u2063\nGreatness is not inherited.\u2063\n\u2063\n👨\u200D✈️ If your father is a pilot, do you assume you will be a pilot all by yourself, without any training or education? If your father is a great batsman, do you think you'll be a great batsman without making any effort? Why then do people think that if the father is a saint of God, then the son or daughter will be a saint of God too?\u2063\n\u2063\n❤️You will be a saint of God if God wants you to be his friend. It depends on God and you. Your family is not involved; the decision is taken by God. If God is willing, he will accept you as a friend. \u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n#ALRATV #GoharShahi #YounusAlGohar #sufi #sufism #agapelove #saint #fate #divinelove #lovequotes #divine #purification #compassion #greatness #selfesteem #selfimprovement #creation #Nirvana #higherself #theself #happiness #motivation #UniversalSufi #hope #socialdistance #hope #strength #positiveenergy #enlightenment #evolve","NumberOfLikes":4,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Tahira Mateen on August 24, 2020.

I'd like to say I've had worse houseguests, but that would be a stretch. There are some lessons to be shared:\n\nFirst, continue all the efforts you are already taking to maintain social distancing, practice thorough and frequent hand-washing, and get adequate rest. Wear a mask if out in shared public spaces.\n\nSecondly, if you or a family member develop symptoms that are suspicious (fever, cough, headache or extreme fatigue and muscle aches), or believe you have been exposed to the coronavirus, don't panic, call the Ministry of Health\n\nThirdly, if you or a family member is diagnosed, you are certainly allowed to feel frightened, and it is also necessary to do a reality check. This is a scary illness, and most people are able to get through it at home with support and guidance from health professionals. The symptoms are no picnic, but in most cases can be managed at home with simple measures and supportive care from the healthcare system.\nWe've all had the flu, or at least most of us have. What makes COVID-19 different is it lingers longer, and the symptoms come and go in unpredictable ways. A good day can be followed by a bad day, followed by something in between.

And while in Stage 3 we've started venturing a little farther, we've been so focused on trying to survive the pandemic OURSELVES that we haven't noticed what's going on all AROUND us.\n\nJust because COVID-19 kept us at home, it by no means kept us all SAFE\u2014reports of domestic and drug abuse didn't go DOWN due to the pandemic... sadly, it all shot UP.\n\nAnd that's why places like @distresscentresgta and the @northyorkwomensshelter are so important\u2014because even with all the new problems we suddenly have, the old ones didn't suddenly go away, and we need places for those of us who can't protect themselves.\n\nSo to help, @thet1agency's come up with a way to support these centres through selling stylish socially distanced tees that let you share a solid message in these challenging times while supporting a great cause, as 100% of the proceeds will go to these organisations!\n\nSo with three designs to choose from, make sure to gon' getcha some at this link, because every little bit helps.\n\nBe well out there, guys, and make sure to help where you can!\n\nCasey OUT.\n\n#partnership #charityfundraising #fundraiser #socialdistance #nonprofit #socialdistancing #supportlocalbusiness #supportlocal #Toronto #helpingothers #charity #tshirt #covid19 #pandemiclife #me #portrait","NumberOfLikes":24,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Yannick Bigourdan on August 24, 2020.

And this post is going to be very personal( kinda journal entry🙈) \n.\nWhy I took a break?\nSuddenly last week I noticed that I was getting too addicted to Instagram and I couldn\u2019t stop refreshing the page again and again to see what\u2019s new happening there. Stalking some random pages, getting excited when people uploaded something new. And after that I started worrying about my social performance. Self-criticism hit hard on me. That was really really not healthy for me(for you also) \nAlways remember that a part of social media is not real. \nThen I realised that I needed a break from all this. I went a step ahead to delete the app( now understand the level of addiction!😂)\nIn these five days, I did all the things to ease my mind and body. I challenge myself to do all the things without posting it as insta stories 😂🙈\nReading novels, listening to podcasts, \nReading about young entrepreneurs , Writing journals, listening to music, I even noticed my water intake 😂 \n.\n.\nWhy I\u2019m saying all these here is, you should manage your insta acc and don\u2019t let the insta acc to manage you...\nWhenever you feel like taking a break, plz do take!! (Don\u2019t worry about the followers count)\nBreak is necessary! Don\u2019t get overwhelmed by social media. \nThis is not real. \nRefreshing the computer(human body) is very very essential for a good run ♥️\n.\n.\n.\nMental health matters more than social media engagements. \n.\n.\n.\nStay safe♥️\n.\n.\n.\n#mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #mentalillness #socialmedia #socialdistance #socialmediadetox #socialmediadetoxing #creators #bloggerslife #chennaiinfluencer #chennaifashionblogger #chennaifashionbloggers #chennaiblogger #coimbatoreblogger #coimbatorefashionblogger #southindianblogger #southindian #staysafe","NumberOfLikes":174,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by 𝒀𝒖𝒗𝒂𝒔𝒓𝒊 𝑺𝒓𝒊𝒏𝒊𝒗𝒂𝒔𝒂𝒏 ✨ on August 24, 2020.
