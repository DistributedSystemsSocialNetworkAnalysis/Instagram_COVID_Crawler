As many of you are aware, I hadn\u2019t left my house (apart from the occasional car ride to nowhere & one road trip to see the same two people I\u2019ve been seeing since June \u2014 my mom & sister) in six months. Saturday night, my sister rented out a movie theater so we could watch Harry Potter & the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone, alone. (It wasn\u2019t too pricey at all, by the way!) Seriously, it was just my husband, my sister, & myself. We watched a movie we\u2019ve seen a hundred times. We were by ourselves. We ate popcorn & drank soda that were unnecessarily expensive. It felt like I got some normalcy back, except for the mask-wearing, frequent washing of the hands, hand-sanitizing, remaining six-feet away from people I wasn\u2019t usually with, & legit flushing the public restroom toilet with my shoe (because I was not about to touch that nastiness with my hand). I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t have at least a few anxiety attacks as we pulled into the parking lot or while we made our way through the main lobby of the theater, but it felt good to get out a bit. Now, we\u2019re headed back to our home in New York, four hours away, where I\u2019ll remain until Rosh Hashana (the Jewish New Year) gets here.

For most, this means that people who are not related, or living together, should remain at least two meters apart. In social circumstances this is reasonably achievable with common-sense and consideration.\n\nHome office not possible in all environments. Governments around the world have mandated that people work from home where possible and only perform essential tasks at their normal place of work when it cannot be avoided. In a lot of work environments social distancing is not always easy. In particular in office settings and control rooms in which desks and workstations are spaced close together and operators sit within the two-meter recommended distance from each other.\n\n#KVM #RemoteAccess #KVMExtender #SocialDistance \n\nhttps:\/\/www.ihse.com\/corona-news-kvm-aids-social-distancing\/\n\nhttps:\/\/www.ihse.com\/corona-news-kvm-aids-social-distancing\/","NumberOfLikes":3,"Hashtags":["#KVM","#RemoteAccess","#KVMExtender","#SocialDistance"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Richard lim on August 23, 2020.

А за последнюю неделю с приездом студентов, вместе с их родителями, \"наш ауыл\" обратно ожил. Это нас радует, хоть мы и не знакомы. Но один факт нас все же тревожил весь последний месяц. Как будут обстоять дела с вирусом? С потоком людей..Ну вы понимаете... \n\n▪️Сначала говорили, что студентов будут тестить каждые 2 недели. А сейчас ничего об этом не слышно. \n\n▪️Но на территорий кампуса @virginia.tech каждый обязан ходить в масках. Однако есть разные люди, кто то носит, а кто то не считает это нужным.\n\n▪️Хорошо что на кампусе можно взять бесплатную маску с символом нашего универа. Будем надеяться, что студенты будут очень осторожны, и соблюдать все правила.\n\n▪️А сегодня проезжая мимо даунтауна(центр) @downtownblacksburg , я увидела табличку с надписью \"маски обязательны на даунтауне города\". Конечно, неудивительно, ведь это место скопления людей. Хотя нет, я не ожидала такого поворота. \n\n▪️В начале августа началась учеба в школах в некоторых штатах. В одной из них, ученики не стали соблюдать положенную дистанцию. Так, выявились несколько заболевших из разных классов. Жалко детей :(\n\n◾️В целом, и школы и садики открываются. Но родители и дети сами решают будут они онлайн учиться или же оффлайн. Короче, как захотят.\n\n▪️Дети до 3х лет могут ходить без масок. Я так рада, что наша дочь попала в эту категорию.\n\n▪️Не узнавала дают ли штраф, но думаю, все правила на законодательном уровне. По крайней мере, ношения масок внтури здания является таковым. \n\nНа фото я такая серьезная, уставшая, и очень нехотевшая носить эту мед.маску. В ней мне не легко дышать. Поэтому приобрела другую 3D версию, из льна и хлопка.

FLAW even started the #ProtectTheVulnerable campaign to help encourage everyone to stay home and help keep those populations safe. But this narrative quickly changed as communities of color were disproportionately affected, children and teenagers became sick, celebrities lost their lives and now as the United States\u2019 cases have doubled in six weeks to over 4 million - one thing has become clear: WE ARE ALL VULNERABLE. \u2063\u2063⠀\n\u2063\u2063⠀\nAt Fight Like A Warrior we believe it is time to come together (metaphorically of course 😉) and wear our masks not for the good of one person or population, but because our nation and world will never get to heal if we do not. \u2063\u2063⠀\n\u2063\u2063⠀\nOne person dies of COVID-19 in the U.S. alone about every 80 seconds . Fellow non-profit coalition parters, doctors, nurses, teachers, chronic illness warriors, and more are coming together to take part in #WeAreAllVulnerable and pledge to wear a mask.\u2063⠀\n\u2063⠀\nJOIN US: \u2063⠀\n\u2063\u2063⠀\n1.

The measure of an individual, or organization, is how one responds to adversity. I believe we have all responded well and is a credit to each individual. 2020 has presented, and will continue to present, challenges but also opportunities. Greater opportunities for online courses. Greater opportunities for long distance learning. Greater opportunities to learn more computer skills. And, perhaps, greater opportunities to spend more time with family. \u2060\nAs long as each of us continues to respond to these ongoing challenges in a similar manner to what we have so far, I believe we will all look back on this year as one of the most memorable years of our lives. If that is the case, and it likely is, then we should continue to strive to have those memories as ones of success in conquering challenges, memorable self-reflection for when future hardships arise in years and decades to come, and the importance of friends, family, and colleagues in helping each other overcome difficulty.\u2060\n\u2060\nThank you all again for coming together and rising to the challenge and making this summer session a great success. I, and the rest of the G-MEO team, look forward to hopefully having many of you in our Fall 2020 classes as well.\"\u2060\n\u2060\n-- Dr. Andy Guth, American University\u2060\n\u2060\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\u2060\n\u2060\n#summer2020 #onlineclass #gmeosummer #college #studyonline #summerstudy #summerplan #summerlife #collegemust #studyinus #summeronline #studyathome  #socialdistance #professor #teachingabroad #teachinginchina #teachinchina #faculty #americanuniversity #university #summerreview\u2060","NumberOfLikes":11,"Hashtags":["#summer2020","#onlineclass","#gmeosummer","#college","#studyonline","#summerstudy","#summerplan","#summerlife","#collegemust","#studyinus","#summeronline","#studyathome","#socialdistance","#professor","#teachingabroad","#teachinginchina","#teachinchina","#faculty","#americanuniversity","#university","#summerreview\u2060"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by G-MEO | Study & Intern Abroad on August 22, 2020.

Vi chiedo di non essere giudiziosi nei confronti di nessuno e di esporre con educazione e tranquillità quello che è il vostro pensiero.\n\n#serafinascrive #serafinalomaisto #riempiAmoisocial #empatiasempre #socialdistance #vicinanzasociale #abbracciovirtualeatutti  #amiciziasocial #relazionisociali #conoscersi #capirsi","NumberOfLikes":45,"Hashtags":["#serafinascrive","#serafinalomaisto","#riempiAmoisocial","#empatiasempre","#socialdistance","#vicinanzasociale","#abbracciovirtualeatutti","#amiciziasocial","#relazionisociali","#conoscersi","#capirsi"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":6,"Timestamp":1598090430,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 12:00:30 CEST 2020","Location":"Puglia, Italy"},{"CaptionText":"રાજસ્થાન સરકારે ઇન્દિરા રસોઇ યોજના શરૂ કરી .\n\nરાજસ્થાન સરકારે 20 August ના રોજ પૂર્વ વડા પ્રધાન રાજીવ ગાંધીને તેમની 76 મી જન્મજયંતિ નિમિત્તે વિશેષ શ્રદ્ધાંજલિ આપવા માટે 'ઇન્દિરા રસોઇ યોજના' શરૂ કરી છે. \n#gpsc #upsc #exam \n#currentaffairs #education #dailygk \n#online #comparativeexam\n#motivation #study #lockdown #india\n#Gujrat\n#Indiafightscorona #fighttogether \n#Breakcorona #Waragainstcorona\n#WashHands #Staysafe \n#SocialDistance","NumberOfLikes":3,"Hashtags":["#gpsc","#upsc","#exam","#currentaffairs","#education","#dailygk","#online","#comparativeexam","#motivation","#study","#lockdown","#india","#Gujrat","#Indiafightscorona","#fighttogether","#Breakcorona","#Waragainstcorona","#WashHands","#Staysafe","#SocialDistance"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @shining_kitab on August 22, 2020.

I know we all are having to adapt during this time, but want to remind people to continue implementing safe practices and to wear your mask not just for you but for the well being of others. Thank you everyone for your constant love and support during this time! I am so thankful to be cleared to go back to work and for my health. Walking in to tonight\u2019s shift with a clear mind and grateful heart. Hope everyone continues to stay safe mentally, emotionally, and physically during these times. ❤️\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#maskupyall#wearingiscaring#wearingamaskisnotapoliticalstatement#wearestillinthemiddleofapandemic#thankfulformybfwhowasmynurse#gearup#12hourvibes#cellfie#pleaseproperlydiposeyourPPE#protecttheocean#selfcareisnotselfish#mentalhealthisimportant#remembertostayhydrated#respiratorytherapy#breatheasy#covid19#scrublife#alwaysremainastudent#grateful#socialdistance#washyohands#communitystrong#nightshift#Texasstaystrong#figs#covidneverleft#quarantineSZN#Iambsckkkk#staysafe","NumberOfLikes":180,"Hashtags":["#maskupyal","#wearingiscarin","#wearingamaskisnotapoliticalstatemen","#wearestillinthemiddleofapandemi","#thankfulformybfwhowasmynurs","#gearu","#12hourvibe","#cellfi","#pleaseproperlydiposeyourPP","#protecttheocea","#selfcareisnotselfis","#mentalhealthisimportan","#remembertostayhydrate","#respiratorytherap","#breatheas","#covid1","#scrublif","#alwaysremainastuden","#gratefu","#socialdistanc","#washyohand","#communitystron","#nightshif","#Texasstaystron","#fig","#covidneverlef","#quarantineSZ","#Iambsckkk","#staysafe"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Niki Helton in Austin, Texas.

We managed to book an airbnb that literally felt like home and was conveniently 7 minutes from the rink. This allowed for us to create a \u201CStaycation\u201D out of the experience and given the current covid situation this was a treat. There were beaches, parks & skateparks within walking distance and we were super surprised to find that some parks even provided hockey nets 😃 Gotta remember to bring our roller blades and skateboard next time🙃\n⛓\nGiven this town is not too far from home (about 1 hr and 30min) not everyone stayed so the boys leaned on each other and bonded on a whole new level. Everyone was really kind and if your from the city, you know this is sometimes hard to come by. They say it takes a village to raise kids and I could quickly see the small town bringing out the boys big hearts. \n⚙️\nWe created memories that will sure last a lifetime.
