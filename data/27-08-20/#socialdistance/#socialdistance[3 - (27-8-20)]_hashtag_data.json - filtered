There are those who care about people's health, and there are those who think it's a trick from the Democrats to get them to vote for them. To those who have been working hard to slow the spread of the coronavirus, I thank you very much.\n\nAs for those who are stubborn to think that this pandemic is fake, I tell you this: I'm stubborn as well. But I'm highly aware of when I'm stubborn, and I often tell myself that if I'm going to be stubborn, it better be something worth being stubborn about. I ask you this: are the deaths of over 170,000 Americans (this is just one part of the world) something worth ignoring? I hope not. There's a reason why people are warning you about the outbreak. Take it from someone who's had family members in Miami (a hotspot for the virus) get the virus. PLEASE take this pandemic seriously. I'm fortunate to not have lost anyone close to me from this virus, but many others haven't been so fortunate.\n\nThis is not a trick, but a wake up call to do what is right for everyone, not just for yourself. Wear a mask, even though you don't want to. If you don't wanna wear a mask, then don't leave your home. Social distance. It may take personal space to a whole new level, but it is to prevent contact with almost any disease. Clean often. This is something that you were supposed to do this entire time, and this pandemic is one of many reasons why. This virus can go away, but it takes ALL of us to do so.

Playing piano and singing songs I enjoy have been a wonderful release. Music really does heal. 🎶\n\n- Lastly, set your boundaries with people!

Kickstands up at 11am at the Shell Gas station on hgwy 392 & I-25 just outside Windsor. \n\nWhile we have been doing our part to minimize risk of COVID-19 to ourselves, friends, and family we've been cooped up in the garage all summer ourselves.

We were invited by @royalmuseumsgreenwich to visit the Royal Observatory, Home of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), now that they have reopened their sites for the first time since March. \u2063\n\u2063\nThey have put lots of social distancing measures in place which made us feel much safer. You can really feel warmly welcomed as soon as you go through their doors. In order to get in, now you will need to book in advance. We were asked to wear a face covering when we were inside. We saw lots of safety signs reminding us to keep our distances and there were plenty of hand sanitizers available throughout. Also, their audio guides have been temporarily suspended. \u2063\n\u2063\nWe haven\u2019t visited the Royal Observatory before so we were all very excited. We learnt all about time and space and we enjoyed exploring Flamstead House. One of the highlights of our visit was the opportunity to stand on the Prime Meridian of the World. This was very cool! \u2063\n\u2063\nWe also saw their Great Equatorial Telescope. It was massive! Very impressive. Another highlight of visiting the Royal Observatory is the view of Greenwich and the City that you can get from there. You can see clearly the Queen\u2019s House which is so pretty. This house is also open now and free of charge to visit. \u2063\n\u2063\nWe then spent the rest of the day wandering around Greenwich and had lunch in the market area. It was such a lovely day so I can highly recommend you to go to Greenwich and visit the Royal Observatory as well as the other sites (The Queen\u2019s House, Cutty Sark and National Maritime Museum). Also, kids go free at Cutty Sark and the Royal Observatory until 31 August!\u2063\n\u2063\nSwipe left for more photos and also check my stories from my \u201CRMG\u201D Highlight and swipe up or check the link in my bio to find out more about visiting the Royal Observatory. \u2063\n \u2063\n𝙃𝙖𝙫𝙚 𝙮𝙤𝙪 𝙗𝙚𝙚𝙣 𝙩𝙤 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙍𝙤𝙮𝙖𝙡 𝙊𝙗𝙨𝙚𝙧𝙫𝙖𝙩𝙤𝙧𝙮 𝙗𝙚𝙛𝙤𝙧𝙚?\u2063\n\u2063\n \u2063\n#ExploreGreenwich #royalmuseumsgreenwich\u2063","NumberOfLikes":781,"Hashtags":["#ExploreGreenwich","#royalmuseumsgreenwich\u2063"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":115,"Timestamp":1597863202,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 19 20:53:22 CEST 2020","Location":"Royal Observatory Greenwich"},{"Owner":"wilmenkoa","CaptionText":"With mom getting better #options are opening back up.

There are some people who still will travel this year and during the winter season despite the coronavirus health risks. As much of an avid international traveler as I am, given the continuing pandemic and the foreseeable future, I personally would not travel any time soon. ...... For those of you taking the risk, here\u2019s an update of where you can go. \u201CAs of August 12, the following countries are open to Americans, with varying health and safety restrictions in place: Antigua, Aruba, Barbados, Barbuda, Belize, Bermuda, Cambodia, Croatia, Dominican Republic, Egypt, French Polynesia, Jamaica, Maldives, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Rwanda, Serbia, St. Barths, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Tanzania, Turkey, Turks and Caicos, United Arab Emirates and the Virgin Islands.\u201D ...... Keep in mind that this can change at any time. There may be entry requirements (negative test results, quarantines upon arrival). US Re-entry requirements could change while you\u2019re out of the country, and you\u2019ll likely need to quarantine for 14 days when you return to the US. ...... As a travel lover and travel agency owner it pains me to see client\u2019s vacation opportunities restricted for the next several months. Fortunately we can and are booking their vacations now for travel next year. This is giving them something to look forward to and a reminder that travel will be back in their lives. It also gives us plenty of time plan, and take advantage of the current deals for 2021 and 2022. 🧳Travel is on the horizon! Hang in there a little longer.

What a ride!\n\n\u2014> Swipe to go back in time and see all phases of our Corona Lockdown.\n\nIt's been 5 months since we had to close down the box on March 15th, 2020. In our almost 10 year history of myleo, this was a completely new and definitely unknowable situation. \nToday, we just want to throwback to this time, when we would watch the news from morning til night and had to write newsletters to our community almost daily.\n\nPhase 1: For 6 whole weeks, online workouts via youtoube livestream and zoom sessions were the only way to keep our members fit (and sane during this crazy time). \n\nPhase 2: Forward to April 26th, when we built our outdoor training cages. Our myleo Cage Training was a huge hit and we made it happen in a very short time after a tough fight with the city administration.\n\nPhase 3: 3 weeks later, we could finally do outdoor group training with 7 athletes.\n\nPhase 4: Finally, after 11 weeks of a closed box, we were allowed to train inside again, but still only 7 athletes and 3m distance. \n\nPhase 5: Another 2 weeks later, after long conversations with the Berlin senate administration, we got the OK to train more athletes. That was when the workouts felt finally almost normal again. \n\n14 weeks of stress, worry and hard work - but also an unforgettable time with lots of encouragement, support and love from so many of our community.\n\nWe are very thankful for everyone who supported us during this hard time and who is still with us today! \n\nLet's hope this will stay just a memory, so please keep your #socialdistance and stay healthy.\n\n#myleocrossfit #myleocommunity #coronolockdown #lockdownfitness #cagetraining #myleocagetraining \n#lockdownyourschweinehund","NumberOfLikes":142,"Hashtags":["#socialdistance","#myleocrossfit","#myleocommunity","#coronolockdown","#lockdownfitness","#cagetraining","#myleocagetraining","#lockdownyourschweinehund"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597841685,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 19 14:54:45 CEST 2020","Location":"Myleo"},{"Owner":"bookworldstationers","CaptionText":"Nothing like an awesome cookbook to take those family dinners to the next level.

Here are a few mask tips for kids from @ameracadpeds:\n\n* Mask should not be placed on children under the age of two years old \n* Mask should fit over your child's nose, mouth, and be secured under their chin. Always check that your child can breathe easily when wearing the mask \n* Children should wash their hands before and after wearing a mask\n* Designate your child as the family \"mask monitor.\" When leaving the house, have them check that everyone has their mask available. Giving children a job or responsibility can help them feel empowered and more in control of a situation\n* For children who may find it difficult to wear a mask, have them look in the mirror with their mask on and talk about why it is important to wear a mask and why people are wearing them \n* Put a mask on a favorite stuffed animal\n* Decorate the mask so they're more personalized and fun and less scary\n* Show your child pictures of other children wearing mask\n* Draw a mask on their favorite character\n* Practice wearing a mask at home to help your child get use to it\n* Set an example and wear a mask yourself and provide positive reinforcement when your child wears one\n* Wash and dry mask after every use\n\n#facemask #facecovering #facemasksupplier #facemasksgoals #reusablemask #maskup #maskon #masked #masks #stopthespread #weareinthistogether #socialdistance #wearamask #staysafe #protectyourself #protectothers #washyourhands","NumberOfLikes":36,"Hashtags":["#facemask","#facecovering","#facemasksupplier","#facemasksgoals","#reusablemask","#maskup","#maskon","#masked","#masks","#stopthespread","#weareinthistogether","#socialdistance","#wearamask","#staysafe","#protectyourself","#protectothers","#washyourhands"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by clowneymasks on August 19, 2020.

Sel-sel ini bertanggung jawab untuk menjaga tubuh kita bekerja setiap harinya, seperti membuat jantung kita berdetak, otak kita berpikir, ginjal membersihkan darah kita, mengganti kulit yang terkelupas, dan seterusnya. Tugas khusus dari stem cell adalah untuk menciptakan berbagai jenis sel tersebut. Stem cell adalah sumber untuk sel-sel baru. Pada saat stem cell membelah, mereka dapat memperbanyak diri sendiri atau menjadi jenis sel yang lain. Contohnya, stem cell di kulit dapat menciptakan lebih banyak stem cell kulit atau mereka dapat membuat sel kulit terdiferensiasi yang memiliki tugas spesifik seperti membuat pigmen melanin.\n\nKenapa Stemcell penting untuk kita?\n\nSaat kita terluka atau sakit, sel kita juga terluka atau mati. Saat hal ini terjadi, stem cell menjadi aktif. Stem cell memiliki tugas untuk memperbaiki jaringan yang terluka atau menggantikan sel lain pada saat mereka mengalami kematian rutin. Dengan cara ini, stem cell kita menjaga kita tetap sehat dan mencegah kita dari penuaan dini. Stem cell bertindak seperti pasukan dokter mikroskopis milik kita sendiri.\n\nSumber : ipscell.com\n.\n.info lebih lanjut call 082245459759\n\n#afclifescience #afcjapan #kesehatan #sop100 #sop100plus #salmon #salmonovarypeptide #utshukushii #antitumor #kanker #jantung #stroke #ginjal #gagalginjal #diabetes #asma #tumor #antiaging #autoimun #healthsupplement #healthsupplements #covid #coronavirus #virus #stemcell #cell #socialdistancing #socialdistance #stayhome #stayhealthy","NumberOfLikes":1,"Hashtags":["#afclifescience","#afcjapan","#kesehatan","#sop100","#sop100plus","#salmon","#salmonovarypeptide","#utshukushii","#antitumor","#kanker","#jantung","#stroke","#ginjal","#gagalginjal","#diabetes","#asma","#tumor","#antiaging","#autoimun","#healthsupplement","#healthsupplements","#covid","#coronavirus","#virus","#stemcell","#cell","#socialdistancing","#socialdistance","#stayhome","#stayhealthy"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by AFC by Stephen in Malang.

What happens when there is a strong longing for personal connection, seeing each other and hearing each in the flesh?
