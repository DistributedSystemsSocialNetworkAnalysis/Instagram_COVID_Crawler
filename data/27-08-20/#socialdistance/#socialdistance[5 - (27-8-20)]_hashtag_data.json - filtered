Si a esto le sumamos las posturas prolongadas e inadecuadas, estaremos hablando de dolor y problemas de salud en un futuro no muy lejano. \n\nEnseñar a los niños a ser conscientes de su cuerpo y de su postura les ayuda a conocerse mejor. Es nuestra labor como adultos guiarlos hacia su salud.\n\nPara esto, te tengo las siguientes recomendaciones:\n\n✔️ Eleva la computadora a su nivel para que el cuello del niño esté en posición neutra.\n\n✔️ Coloca un banquito para que apoye sus pies. Esto le brindará equilibrio a sus músculos y articulaciones.\n\n✔️ Si sólo cuentas con sillas grandes, coloca una o dos almohadas para que apoye su cuello y espalda.\n\n✔️ Si tu hijo es muy inquieto y se cansa rápido de la silla, sientalo por ratos en un cojín o balón terapéutico.\n\n✔️ La posición prona o Boca abajo le permite al niño descansar del patrón flexor que da la silla. Es excelente para mejorar la propiocepcion y la fuerza del tronco.\n\n✔️ La posición de rodillas le ayudará en su equilibrio y a la fuerza del CORE\n\n#fisiotipsonline #fisioterapia #fisio #terapiafisica #rehabilitacion #ejercicio #postura #espalda #columna #niños #aprendizaje #escuelaadistancia\n#quedateencasa #covid19 #coronavirus #chitreanos6 #chitre_progresa #panama #educacion #education #socialdistance #chiriqui #veraguas #cocle #zoom #laberraquerac6herrera #noticias_azuero_","NumberOfLikes":24,"Hashtags":["#fisiotipsonline","#fisioterapia","#fisio","#terapiafisica","#rehabilitacion","#ejercicio","#postura","#espalda","#columna","#niños","#aprendizaje","#escuelaadistancia","#quedateencasa","#covid19","#coronavirus","#chitreanos6","#chitre_progresa","#panama","#educacion","#education","#socialdistance","#chiriqui","#veraguas","#cocle","#zoom","#laberraquerac6herrera","#noticias_azuero_"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597495399,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 14:43:19 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"the411lounge","CaptionText":"Facts! 💪🏾 #goodmorning #itssaturday #prayedup #saturdaymorning #saturdayvibes #saturdaymood #saturdaythoughts #saturdaymotivation #message #morningmotivation #morningvibes #morningmood #socialdistance #motivation #morningvibes #morningthoughts #staysafe #the411lounge","NumberOfLikes":29,"Hashtags":["#goodmorning","#itssaturday","#prayedup","#saturdaymorning","#saturdayvibes","#saturdaymood","#saturdaythoughts","#saturdaymotivation","#message","#morningmotivation","#morningvibes","#morningmood","#socialdistance","#motivation","#morningvibes","#morningthoughts","#staysafe","#the411lounge"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The 411 Lounge on August 15, 2020.

Per circa due settimane avresti festeggiato la fine dei lavori agricoli ballando e brindando a Conso, dio della terra e della fertilità. Infatti i romani, chiamavano questo periodo i Consualia.\nL'imperatore Augusto, che di marketing se ne intendeva, dedica questi festeggiamenti a lui stesso, al suo riposo. Da qui feriae Augusti (dopo tanto \u201Cimpereggiare\u201D anche lui aveva bisogno di ferie, no?). Lo stesso mese prende il nome da lui!\nPer tutto l'impero venivano organizzate feste e corse di cavalli (chissà che la tradizione del palio di Siena non provenga proprio da qui!). Anche gli animali che avevano aiutato gli uomini nei lavori agricoli \u201Candavano in ferie\u201D e venivano adornati di fiori! Durante i festeggiamenti i contadini andavano ad omaggiare i proprietari terrieri per ringraziarli, e questi, in cambio, gli donavano dei soldi, una specie di mancia. La celebrazione vera e propria era il 1° di Agosto ma i festeggiamenti duravano fino al 13, il giorno dedicato alla dea Diana. Nei secoli la tradizione rimase: guai a chi abolisce una festa! Quindi la Chiesa Cattolica spostò il giorno di festa dal 1° al 15 e lo dedicò all'Assunzione in cielo, anima e corpo, di Maria (dogma che sarà riconosciuto solo nel 1950). \nA Siena invece, durante il medioevo, per il 15 di Agosto, avresti assistito alla processione \u201Cdei ceri e dei censi\u201D: un atto di vassallaggio dei castelli e dei signori del territorio senese alla Repubblica. Le celebrazioni culminavano con la corsa dei cavalli: chi raggiungeva per primo la Cattedrale, dopo esser partito da una delle porte della città, vinceva un \u201Cpallium\u201D, un grande pezzo di stoffa preziosa, che avrebbe poi dato il nome alla Festa. Un palio decisamente diverso da quello attuale (che oggi si svolge il 16 del mese).\nPer tutti questo sarà un \u201Cferragosto\u201D decisamente insolito (figuriamoci per i senesi!). Speriamo di \u201Crifarci\u201D l'anno prossimo, magari con lo stesso entusiasmo che ci mettevano i romani!","NumberOfLikes":12,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Dipinto che riprende una festa in epoca romana.

Jumlah sel NK adalah 10-15% dari semua limfosit perifer darah. Sel NK termasuk dalam kelompok sel limfoid bawaan yaitu kelompok sel limfoid namun bekerja pada sistem imun bawaan. Sel NK mengekpresikan reseptor yang berbeda dengan turunan limfosit pada umumnya yaitu tidak memiliki TCR, CD3, dan reseptor Ig. Protein marker dari sel NK adalah molekul CD16 dan CD56.[1]\n\nSel NK tidak menyerang sel yang mempunyai ekspresi protein MHC (sama seperti sel T CD8), tetapi menyerang sel yang tidak memiliki ekspresi protein MHC tubuh.[2] Sel-sel dinamakan sel pembunuh alami karena sel-sel bisa langsung beraksi tanpa membutuhkan aktivasi. Sel target akan mengalami apoptosis dan hancur, akibat sekresi sel NK dari granula toksik yang mengandung protein jenis perforin dan granzim.\n\nSalah satu patent fungsi dalam Utsukushhii yaitu Anti Tumor Agent yang dapat memicu sel NK di dalam tubuh kita\n\nInfo & Order hub:\n0822 3193 7339\n.\n.\n#afclifescience #afcjapan #kesehatan #sop100 #sop100plus #salmon #salmonovarypeptide #utsukushhii #antitumor #kanker #jantung #stroke #ginjal #gagalginjal #diabetes #asma #tumor #antiaging #autoimun #healthsupplement #healthsupplements #corona #coronavirus #virus #stemcell #cell #socialdistancing #socialdistance #stayhome #stayhealthy","NumberOfLikes":3,"Hashtags":["#afclifescience","#afcjapan","#kesehatan","#sop100","#sop100plus","#salmon","#salmonovarypeptide","#utsukushhii","#antitumor","#kanker","#jantung","#stroke","#ginjal","#gagalginjal","#diabetes","#asma","#tumor","#antiaging","#autoimun","#healthsupplement","#healthsupplements","#corona","#coronavirus","#virus","#stemcell","#cell","#socialdistancing","#socialdistance","#stayhome","#stayhealthy"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597460503,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 05:01:43 CEST 2020","Location":"Kota Malang"},{"Owner":"mcos880","CaptionText":"ソーシャルディスタンスに配慮\n#東京ディズニーシー #東京ディズニーリゾート #tokyodisneyresort #tokyodisneysea #socialdistance","NumberOfLikes":11,"Hashtags":["#東京ディズニーシー","#東京ディズニーリゾート","#tokyodisneyresort","#tokyodisneysea","#socialdistance"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597460273,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 04:57:53 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"brandaddicted.yenzholic","CaptionText":"MASKER COTTON 100%\nSIZE DEWASA NORMAL , DEWASA JUMBO DAN SIZE ANAK ANAK\n\nLEMBUT - NYAMAN DI PAKE SEHARIAN\nTEBEL YA BUKAN BARANG TIPIS\nSUDAH TIDAK PERLU LAPIS MASK MEDIS ataupun tissue tambahan lagi\n\nTexture juara , serap keringat !\nTEBAL - RECOMENDED !! ❌ TIDAK BIKIN HIDUNG GATAL\n❌ BUKAN BAHAN SCUBA\n❌ BUKAN BAHAN POLYSTER\n❌ BUKAN BARANG TIPIS\n\nDI PAKAI  LIFETIME SELAMANYA\nCUCI PAKAI ULANG RIBUAN KALI\nSANGAT BERGUNA & PASTI KEPAKAI\n\nLIMITED STOCK KARNA\nNYETOK UNTUK PAKE SENDIRI JUGA!!

This means a positive antibody test does not yet definitively indicate whether you can get infected again or if you can infect others with the virus. Until we know, it is best to continue to stay safe by continuing to wear a mask and social-distance.\n\nFact 2: You still need to wear your mask outside.\n\nYou should continue to wear a mask whenever you leave your house unless you are social-distanced outdoors or with people only from your household.\n\nFact 3: Your mask should cover both your mouth and nose for full protection.\n\nRespiratory droplets could contain COVID-19 and can transmit out through your nose. Make sure your mask fits snugly just under the bridge of your nose and stops right below your chin. \n.\n.\n.\n.\n#HealthTap #telemedicine #telemedicineawareness #telehealth #telehealthcare #healthcareinnovation #healthcaretechnology #healthcareindustry #healthcaresolutions #healthcaresystem #digitalhealthcare #homehealth #homehealthcare #wearamask #washyourhands #socialdistance #covid19tips #stopthespread #staysafe #socialdistancing #masks #mask #howto #masktips #masks101 #masksafety #diy #didyouknow","NumberOfLikes":13,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#HealthTap","#telemedicine","#telemedicineawareness","#telehealth","#telehealthcare","#healthcareinnovation","#healthcaretechnology","#healthcareindustry","#healthcaresolutions","#healthcaresystem","#digitalhealthcare","#homehealth","#homehealthcare","#wearamask","#washyourhands","#socialdistance","#covid19tips","#stopthespread","#staysafe","#socialdistancing","#masks","#mask","#howto","#masktips","#masks101","#masksafety","#diy","#didyouknow"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by HealthTap on August 14, 2020.
