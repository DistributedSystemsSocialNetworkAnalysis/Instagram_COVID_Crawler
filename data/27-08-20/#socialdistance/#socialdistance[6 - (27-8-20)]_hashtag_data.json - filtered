Maybe the body (and mind) feels like it's dragging. Turn the tide and get the vitality to flow back in! \n\nThere's been more than one factor affecting people in unhealthy ways, indirectly related or unrelated to the coronavirus. State restrictions\/quarantine, focusing attention on how to protect ourselves and others from infection, limits on where to go and available activities, plus summer heat, and other factors can contribute to fatigue. Plus, you may feel it more if you're older. \n\nWhile some of these are beyond our direct control, what you CAN do to flip the fatigue and regain energy is nutrition. Smart carbs--slow and steady wins the race--includes whole grains, fruit, vegetables; good calories (avoid the processed foods and too many sweets); proteins (don't skimp on these, but be sure to get them from healthy sources, such as nuts, beans, lean meats, etc.); healthy hydration (and it doesn't just have to be in the form of drink, as there are fruits and vegetables that are good sources of hydration, too). \n\nFor further info to good food and less fatigue, copy this link into your browser's address bar. \nhttps:\/\/bit.ly\/3kd3kGo\n\n@personalcarechiropra\n@ConsumerReports\n\n#Chiropractic\n#Chiropractor\n#chiropracticcare\n#ArlingtonChiropractor\n#arlingtonchiropractic\n#wellness\n#wellnesstips\n#takecare\n#wellbeing\n#SelfCareTips\n#HealthyLife\n#QualityLife\n#HealthProtection\n#ProtectYourHealth\n#together\n#SocialDistance\n#HealthyEating\n#HealthyEatingTips\n#HealthyNutrition\n#SelfCare\n#diet\n#fatigue\n#SlowCarbs\n#WholeGrains\n#legumes\n#fruits\n#vegetables\n#FruitsAndVegetables","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#Chiropractic","#Chiropractor","#chiropracticcare","#ArlingtonChiropractor","#arlingtonchiropractic","#wellness","#wellnesstips","#takecare","#wellbeing","#SelfCareTips","#HealthyLife","#QualityLife","#HealthProtection","#ProtectYourHealth","#together","#SocialDistance","#HealthyEating","#HealthyEatingTips","#HealthyNutrition","#SelfCare","#diet","#fatigue","#SlowCarbs","#WholeGrains","#legumes","#fruits","#vegetables","#FruitsAndVegetables"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Personal Care Chiro & Massage on August 13, 2020.

Why? When someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain viruses. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets or even virus if the person has the disease.''\n\nWith Keepa, when kids are not at a safe social distance in public🚎, they'll receive warnings from their Keepa. This will help kids make a habit of keeping a safe social distance. Keepa is integrated with 3 alert modes and comes with a wrist strap and lanyard for ease of use. kids can switch different alert modes and decide how to wear it as they like, making it more like a cute toy watch that is appealing to kids than a common alarm⏰. \n\n📋Learn more: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2DNluy6\n.\n.\n.\n.\n. \n#covidsafe #backtoschool #backtoschool2020 #schoolbegins #handwashing #socialdistance #socialdistancing","NumberOfLikes":8,"Hashtags":["#covidsafe","#backtoschool","#backtoschool2020","#schoolbegins","#handwashing","#socialdistance","#socialdistancing"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by TinkerGen | STEM Education on August 13, 2020.

You need to feel comfortable and ready to enjoy your adventure. Choose multi-use shoes. Do not pack one pair per night. \n\n👝Buy a small travel bag and small bottles to put your shampoo, creams, and soap. This is the perfect time to use those samples you have in your bathroom and have never used.\n \n🔌Do not forget your electronics and chargers. \n\n🤩Now you have packed only what you need and have a lot of additional space.

Children are much more likely to learn a skill when practicing it, even in role play situations, rather than simply hearing about it.  This is where social stories often fail.  While they may explain how to social distance in school or the community, research has shown that the key to success isn\u2019t just reading or hearing about what to do, but to actually do it.  In Behavioral Skills Training, role play is often used in the beginning because you can control so much of the situation.

I did a listing presentation for a potential client and, out of curiosity, I looked up the past selling prices for the same property.  In 1998, her home sold for $116K.  In 2014, she purchased the property for $172K.  If she were to list the home today, the probable selling price would be approximately $235K.  That\u2019s a $63,000 jump in price in just 6 years FOR THE SAME HOUSE!!! If you desire a certain type of home or even a certain neighborhood, don\u2019t keep waiting....you may get priced out.  #GetTheDealDone 😀  Ready to Buy, Sell, Rent or Invest in Real Estate?

Since both countries' languages are closely related, and many Romanians understand at least some Italian, it's an apposite choice.\n\nBut the festival's 19th edition will of course be most remembered for the conditions it has to be held in. All film screenings are outdoors and the seating has been reduced for safety.\n\nThe main stage, in a big city square that would usually host an audience of 2000, is limited to just 500.\n\nThe French romantic comedy-drama \"La Belle Époque\" by Nicolas Bedos with Daniel Auteuil and Fanny Ardant was the first to be shown at the opening gala on Friday night.\n\nThis year, for the first time, at least 20 films from the festival will be available for two weeks through the TIFF Unlimited VOD platform.\n\n#covid19 #socialdistance #news","NumberOfLikes":0,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#socialdistance","#news"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by GINZBURG FUND on August 12, 2020.

I did everything to negate and purify my Lower Self. I spent hours upon hours in hardcore, physical worship. But it didn't really help much in purifying the Lower Self. The ego was always bending towards negativity. The ego didn't seem to be affected by any hardcore worship. \u2063\n\u2063\n✨The moment I started to accumulate love for my Master, HDE Gohar Shahi - it was the first beam of love that crushed my ego. Nothing is more constructive in terms of cleansing and purifying the Lower Self; no worship is as effective as love is.\u2063\n\u2063\nThese were my findings.\u2063\n\u2063\n❣️💥True love will crush the idol of your ego.\u2063\n\u2063\nThis is true whether your heart is filled with true love either for God or for any human being. If you love somebody, then at least for that person, you have no ego. \u2063\n\u2063\nIf you love somebody and you still have an ego, your love is fake.\u2063\n\u2063\n💪Only love will set you free from the shackles of ego, nothing else! Not even divine energy has as much power as love does. No divine energy can do wonders like the wonders of love. Love is the best medicine.\u2063\n\u2063\n💖In love, you are humble. In love, you have no ego. Love and ego cannot coexist in one heart.\u2063\n\u2063\nThere is no greater blessing than love.

Humility and self-awareness are among the prerequisites to wisdom. \u2063\n\u2063\nAction is the final essential component of wisdom. Knowledge not acted upon is merely a collection of facts.

Variation prevents me from being bored and by result working out doesn't seem like a chore.\n\nLong story short, try something new especially in the gym.\n-\n🦅Back & Bis Workout\n🔹️Wide Grip Bent Over Rows\n🔹️Neutral Grip Lat Pulldowns\n🔹️Wide Grip Lat Pulldowns \n🔹️Straight Arm Pushdowns\n🔹️Preacher Curls\n🔹️Zottman Curls\n-\n🎶 Vanic x K.Flay - So Slow","NumberOfLikes":73,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":8,"Timestamp":1597202881,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 12 05:28:01 CEST 2020","Location":"Crunch Fitness"},{"Owner":"updevdowndev","CaptionText":"SOOOOO taking my practice outside LEVELS it tf up.
