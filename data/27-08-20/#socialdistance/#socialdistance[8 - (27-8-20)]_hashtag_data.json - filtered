Cases are INCREASING! This only worsens the quarantine experience.\n\u2063\nWith restaurants especially opening in Pakistan, we encourage everyone to do the following: \u2063\n\u2063\n1. 𝐏𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐞 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐮𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐝𝐨 𝐭𝐚𝐤𝐞-𝐨𝐮𝐭𝐬. By going indoors you\u2019re inviting trouble not only to yourself, but the staff members too. You don\u2019t know how they\u2019ve travelled, which other exposed customers they\u2019ve come in contact with, what measures they\u2019re taking. The same applies to yourself, so why put each other at risk?\u2063\n\u2063\n2. If you must go out, 𝐜𝐡𝐨𝐨𝐬𝐞 𝐚𝐧 𝐨𝐮𝐭𝐝𝐨𝐨𝐫 𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐜𝐞 𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐧 𝐚𝐧 𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐨𝐨𝐫. With the wind, and open air, the risk is not completely gone but is reduced. In a confined space, you\u2019re more likely to breathe the same air and therefore exposed to a higher degree of risk through air particles. E.g. if someone sneezes indoor. \u2063\n\u2063\n3. Maintain strict SOPs in whatever you do. This means to sanitize every time your hand comes in contact, keep your hands away from your face, and here comes the forever protocol: 𝐀𝐋𝗪𝐀𝐘𝐒 𝗪𝐄𝐀𝐑 𝐀 𝐌𝐀𝐒𝐊! Even if someone is infected, they\u2019re doing a far better job by wearing a mask and keeping themselves + others safe from infection (𝘴𝘪𝘥𝘦 𝘯𝘰𝘵𝘦: 𝘪𝘧 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘢𝘳𝘦 𝘪𝘯𝘧𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘦𝘥, 𝘰𝘳 𝘴𝘩𝘰𝘸𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘴𝘪𝘨𝘯𝘴 𝘰𝘧 𝘧𝘭𝘶 𝘰𝘳 𝘧𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳, 𝘱𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘴𝘦 𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘺 𝘢𝘵 𝘩𝘰𝘮𝘦)\u2063\n\u2063\nAt the end of the day: If you haven\u2019t been exposed to COVID19, consider yourself PRIVILEGED. COVID19 is out there regardless, so why take the small risk, at the expense of your health, others\u2019 health, community\u2019s health? \u2063\n\u2063\nStay safe. Stay home. \u2063\n\u2063\n#covidpakistan #pakistan #lahore #karachi #islamabad #covidreliefpakistan #covidrelief #covidreliefpk #sharetoaware #covid19 #socialdistance #wearamask #stayathome #quarantine #healthcomesfirst #tiktok #instagood #staysafe","NumberOfLikes":14,"Hashtags":["#covidpakistan","#pakistan","#lahore","#karachi","#islamabad","#covidreliefpakistan","#covidrelief","#covidreliefpk","#sharetoaware","#covid19","#socialdistance","#wearamask","#stayathome","#quarantine","#healthcomesfirst","#tiktok","#instagood","#staysafe"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1596904892,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 08 18:41:32 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Trying to #adultcoloringbook so I don't go postal on people I know going to #sturgis rally.

How do you meditate? How do you \u201Cunplug\u201D? Here are some ideas on how to become more present in life: ⠀\n.⠀\n🔸Create a cell phone free time in your day. Dedicate breaks of time where your cell phone is out of sight, so you can focus and truly be with people during your day. ⠀\n🔸 Silence notifications \u2013 When you are not required to answer a text, call, or email, turn your phone on silent so that you can avoid constant distraction and not be tempted to answer immediately.  Stress can be caused by the pressure felt by having to answer immediately or multi-task. ⠀\n🔸 Tune into nature \u2013 One of the best ways to ensure you are centered and engaged in the present is to be out in nature. Soaking in the sounds, getting some fresh air and sun exposure is amazing for the mind, body, and spirit.⠀\nPhoto credit: @sonialyani ⠀\n.⠀\n.⠀\n.⠀\n#hotyoga #hotyogahouston #theoriginal #acceptnosubstitutes #ihp #infernohotpilates #socialdistance #virtualconnection #letsstaytogether","NumberOfLikes":29,"Hashtags":["#hotyoga","#hotyogahouston","#theoriginal","#acceptnosubstitutes","#ihp","#infernohotpilates","#socialdistance","#virtualconnection","#letsstaytogether"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Hot Yoga Houston on August 08, 2020.

A piece I made in the height of the Black Lives Matter Protests, calling for justice for George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, along with countless other victims of police brutality and violence. As I was drawing this, the news would focus largely on the smaller incidents of riots and street vandalism, caused mostly by just agitators independent of the actual movement. So framing a protestor against a fiery backdrop with the presence of police indicated to the left felt like a good way to get the feeling of being in the moment. The idea of them holding the American Flag was also to indicate the stakes involved, the revolution at place as well as the complicated history BIPOCs have with the US. Same with the colors of the protestor outfit, which are modeled off the Pan African Flag, again denoting the history of Africa and its people with this country. The pose, stoic, prepared, the figure is female and strong, clenched fists, someone who will fight for their right to live.\n\nDrawn in @autodesksketchbook on the iPad Mini 4 using the @53pencil .\n\nNew post Next Friday!!

I needed to go or I would not have made this trip now. Now that we are home safely I feel comfortable pulling out my phone for a post.

It was a beautiful view. I love Zacatecas. However I do not recommend traveling during covid unless you are fully committing to ALL sanitizing practice in public and in private. & Knowing that traveling now days is more of an anxious feeling than a relaxing one in all cases. Parents are getting fined for children\u2019s noses showing out from the face masks. We took the risk and honestly it was frightening at times. Luckily Mexico has shoe cleaning regulations that you don\u2019t see here in the USA. So that made me feel cleaner as well. We are OCD about shoes and our dogs feet get cleaned several times a day.
