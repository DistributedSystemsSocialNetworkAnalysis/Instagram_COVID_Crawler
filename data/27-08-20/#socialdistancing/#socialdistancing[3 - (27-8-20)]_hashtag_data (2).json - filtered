This salad always serves as a great side dish, but I wanted to eat this for my actual lunch and decided to fry up some sweet plantains to join the fun. \nIf this wasn\u2019t enough to send my taste buds through the roof, I whipped up a homemade mint and jalapeño vinaigrette to accompany it.\nThis was heaven, y\u2019all.

The information was provided following a request by Ms von der Leyen.\n\nIn the documents, Mr Hogan said he tested negative for Covid-19 during a hospital visit on 5 August and received a negative Covid-19 test while in hospital.\n\nIn an interview with RTÉ News yesterday he said that he broke no regulations while in Ireland, was no risk to anybody but made big mistakes and is very embarrassed.\n\nHe said that as he had tested negative for Covid-19 shortly, it exempted him from the requirement to restrict movements for 14 days.\n\nHowever the Department of Health issued a statement saying a person is required to restrict their movements for 14 days if they arrive into Ireland from a country not on the green list.\n\nIt said the guidance does not state that a negative Covid-19 test shortens the 14-days requirement.\n\nLast night the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and the leader of the Green Party said it was clear that Mr Hogan had breached the public health guidelines since he travelled to Ireland.\n\n#coronavirus #covid19 #socialdistancing #galway #golf #event #ireland #philhogan #europe #eu","NumberOfLikes":1636,"Hashtags":["#coronavirus","#covid19","#socialdistancing","#galway","#golf","#event","#ireland","#philhogan","#europe","#eu"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by RTÉ News on August 26, 2020.

That determination will be at the discretion of local authorities, and not dependent on a particular case count or statistical threshold.\u2063\n*\u2063\nThe guide calls for students in cohorts that have been dismissed from school to be tested \"as soon as possible,\" though there is no requirement for mandatory COVID-19 testing.\u2063\n*\u2063\nStudents will not be permitted to return to school if they are showing any symptoms related to COVID-19. However, they will be permitted to return to class even if they do not take a test, provided they do not develop symptoms during a 14-day self-isolation period.\u2063\n*\u2063\nInformation about confirmed cases at schools will also be made available to parents and the public online, though details will be limited in order to protect the identities of COVID-19 patients.\u2063\n*\u2063\nThe new provincial guide is designed to act as a resource for local public health units, which are ultimately responsible for investigating cases and making recommendations to school boards.\u2063\n*\u2063\nThe document also calls for the siblings of a student with a confirmed or probable case to be sent home to self-isolate.

Among elderly people, chronic diseases, restricted mobility, bereavement, elderly abuse, isolation, and loss of income are major risk factors for depression. Depression in elderly individuals may have a varied presentation, and it may be difficult to diagnose. It has devastating consequences and contributes significantly to misery in this phase of life. It is associated with increased risk of morbidity, decreased physical, cognitive, and social functioning, and greater self-neglect. Depression not only decreases the quality of life, but it also influences prognosis of other chronic diseases that further aggravates disability. Consequently, elderly individuals with depression have significantly higher suicidal and non-suicidal mortality. Thus, it is absolutely essential to care for mental well-being.","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by NNDC- India Foundation on August 26, 2020.

Happy Wednesday! Today\u2019s stop on my pandemic Hollywood tour is the house from the show \u201CYoung Sheldon\u201D which is a spin-off of the highly popular sitcom \u201CThe Big Bang Theory\u201D!\n\nTaking place in the late 80s\/early 90s, \u2018Young Sheldon\u2019 focuses on the childhood of the most popular character of \u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019 Sheldon Cooper and revolves around his coming-of-age in East Texas. \n\nThe supposed Medford, Texas home of the Cooper family on the series is actually located at \u202A5501 Morella Avenue in Valley Village\u202C! The house, which was built in 1949, is designed with a ranch aesthetic and is located just more than a couple of miles from Warner Bros. Studio - where all the interior scenes are shot. Please note that this is a private residence so if you visit please do not trespass or disturb the people that live there.\n\nThis funny CBS sitcom was created by Chuck Lorre and stars Iain Armitage as young Sheldon, alongside Zoe Perry, Lance Barber, Montana Jordan, Raegan Revord, and the fabulous Annie Potts as Constance \"Connie\" Sheldon\u2019s grandmother, whom everyone refer to as \"Meemaw\". Jim Parsons, who portrays the adult Sheldon Cooper on The Big Bang Theory, narrates the series and serves as an executive producer.\n\nFun facts - Zoe Perry plays Sheldon's mother, Mary Cooper. Perry is the real-life daughter of Laurie Metcalf, who portrayed the older version of Mary Cooper on \u201CThe Big Bang Theory.\u201D\n\nThe idea of the show first came to Jim Parsons. At first, he did not discuss it with Chuck Lorre because he thought that Lorre must have considered it before. But when Jim finally consulted him, Chuck liked the idea and had not thought about it before.\n\nIain Armitage (Young Sheldon) said he was committed to his role of Sheldon thanks to Jim Parsons (Adult Sheldon) coaching him and explaining who Sheldon is.\n\nIn the Thanksgiving episode in season 2, Missy says she is thankful for there being two Ghostbuster cartoons. Annie Potts, who plays MeeMaw, appeared in the two live action Ghostbuster movies and the 2016 reboot. #filminglocation #youngsheldon #jimparsons #valleyvillage #hollywoodtour #pandemic2020 #socialdistancing #wearamask #tonymiros","NumberOfLikes":24,"Hashtags":["#filminglocation","#youngsheldon","#jimparsons","#valleyvillage","#hollywoodtour","#pandemic2020","#socialdistancing","#wearamask","#tonymiros"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598459998,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 26 18:39:58 CEST 2020","Location":"Valley Villiage, Ca"},{"Owner":"alexandraforneris","CaptionText":"Happy international dog day 🐕\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#internationaldogday #picoftheday #dogsofinstagram #doglife #doglover #huntingtonbeach #socialdistancing #2020 #huntingtondogbeach #orangecounty #california","NumberOfLikes":65,"Hashtags":["#internationaldogday","#picoftheday","#dogsofinstagram","#doglife","#doglover","#huntingtonbeach","#socialdistancing","#2020","#huntingtondogbeach","#orangecounty","#california"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Alex in Dog Beach In Huntington Beach.
