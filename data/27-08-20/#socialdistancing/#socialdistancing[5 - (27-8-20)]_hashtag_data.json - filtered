Wir werden bewusster zusammenkommen. Weil wir gelernt haben, wie wertvoll eigentlich das Zusammenkommen ist - sowohl in Person als auch virtuell. Kommunikationswege haben sich veraÃàndert und verkuÃàrzt. Alles passiert schneller, flexibler, zeitunabhaÃàngiger. Aber auch der #Austausch und das #Netzwerken? Wir beide haben unseren aktuellen #Job bei der #DB in Zeiten des Home Office angetreten und schnell gelernt, dass ohne einen Austausch das GefuÃàhl von #Orientierungslosigkeit und #Leere entstehen kann. Eine Verabredung zum #Lunch oder #Coffee hilft- und geht auch virtuell! Da uns das Homeoffice noch laÃànger begleiten wird, ist es essenziell, die Bedeutung des Netzwerkens in Zeiten von Corona zu sehen und zu verstehen. \n‚ñ™Ô∏è#Challenge\nDaher moÃàchten wir Euch zu einer #offline und #online challenge herausfordern: Offline moÃàchten wir Euch ermutigen, Euch einen Monat lang mindestens einmal pro Woche bewusst mit ausgewaÃàhlten Kollegen oder GeschaÃàftspartnern zum #Lunch oder #Kaffee zu verabreden. Online laden wir Euch zum virtuellen #coffeedate in der #tagfcommunity ein! Lernt Euch kennen & vernetzt Euch bei einem #virtualcoffeetalk. Wir unterstuÃàtzen Euch gerne dabei, koordinieren die GespraÃàche und nehmen auch selbst gerne teil. Kommentiert einfach unter dem Post oder schickt uns eine PN, wenn ihr Lust habt, bei unserer virtuellen #Community Netzwerkidee dabei zu sein.

Make sure to READ THROUGH the following COVID-19 safety guidelines and join us under the sun!üå∏üçí\n*\n1- Please do not come if you have any symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, coughing), have been in contact with someone who has COVID-19, or have travelled in the past 14 days.\n2- Stay 6 feet (2 meters) away from each other. A good way of doing this is bringing a sheet to show what is your space! \n3- If you have to sneeze or cough, do it into your elbow! \n4- Please keep your hands and objects to yourself! Don\u2019t share water bottles, utensils or food (saliva = high risk), and be mindful when sharing other items! For instance, if you are passing along a book to a friend, disinfect the cover! \n5- Mask up in any indoor spaces on your way over (STM, etc). It should cover your nose and mouth, and be comfy but tight. \n6- P10 will be providing hand sanitizer so you can sanitize when you arrive! \n7- We are asking everyone to register so that if any attendee comes down with COVID-19, we can let everyone know about it (we won\u2019t say it was you, of course!). Please let us know if you end up testing positive for COVID-19 before (insert date two weeks after event) - this will help us alert everyone! \n8- If you either can't meet in person or don't feel safe meeting up, listen to your boundaries and needs! We have tons of activities that you can join virtually, and we hope to see you there!\n*\nWe will be in PARC LAFONTAINE, near the water. To find us, look for the P10 banner and follow the sound of music. If you can\u2019t find us, send us a DM.

I was prayed up but still couldn't relax. I knew that I needed to find my happy place so that I could calm myself and be able to take care of him after surgery. Soooo I took off my muu muu house dress and put on my favorite color.... pink lipstick, pink dress and pink shoes and headed to the coast. The plan was to take a drive and maybe put my feet in the water if the beach wasn't too crowded.¬† Well I am happy to say that not just my feet but I was able to get in the water, it felt divine, soothing, calming, my happy place. After praying and having a self care day at my happy place, yesterday I was able to CALMLY wait with my husband in pre-op for two hours and then¬† CALMLY wait in the parking lot for two hours until the surgery¬†was over.

If soap and water are not available, they can use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.\nHowever, swallowing just a tiny amount of hand sanitizer can cause alcohol¬†poisoning in children. Many hand sanitizers are made with alcohol or rubbing alcohol (ethanol, ethyl alcohol, or isopropanol, isopropyl alcohol). Alcohol poisoning symptoms include sleepiness, low blood sugar, seizures and coma, and it can be fatal.\nChildren and adults also have been poisoned after using hand sanitizer that contained¬†methanol \u200B(also called wood alcohol, methyl alcohol, or methylated spirits). It should not be used in hand sanitizer, and these products were recently¬†recalled. Methanol is toxic if swallowed or after repeated use on skin. It may cause nausea, vomiting, headache, blurred vision, blindness, seizures, coma, permanent damage to the nervous system, or death.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics urges parents to keep hand sanitizers out of children's reach.¬†Don't forget about travel-size bottles of sanitizer in purses, diaper bags, backpacks and cars. Parents and caregivers also should supervise children ages 5 and younger when they use hand sanitizer.\n\nHand sanitizer & COVI\u200B\u200BD-19\n\nAs families began buying more hand sanitizer during the COVID-19 pandemic, the National Poison Data System started getting more reports of unintentional exposures in children. In the first half of 2020, there have been 46% more¬†reported cases about hand sanitizer¬†than during the same time last year. Many reports were about children ages 5 years and younger.\nHealth experts recommend using hand sanitizer that is 60% to 95% alcohol to kill the virus that causes COVID-19. \n\nText extracted from: https:\/\/www.healthychildren.org\/English\n\n#safetyfirst #mnfrsafe #handsanitizer #madeinusa #ppe #ppesupplies #protection #besafe #beready #medicalsupplies #gelsanitizer #covid #coronavirus #safety #mask #facemask #staysafe #stayhome #socialdistancing #pandemic #quarantine #gelcare #health #firstaidkit #medicalkit #love","NumberOfLikes":6,"Hashtags":["#safetyfirst","#mnfrsafe","#handsanitizer","#madeinusa","#ppe","#ppesupplies","#protection","#besafe","#beready","#medicalsupplies","#gelsanitizer","#covid","#coronavirus","#safety","#mask","#facemask","#staysafe","#stayhome","#socialdistancing","#pandemic","#quarantine","#gelcare","#health","#firstaidkit","#medicalkit","#love"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598375704,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 19:15:04 CEST 2020","Location":"MIAMI florida \/ EE.UU"},{"Owner":"blackmenonair","CaptionText":"#BlackMenOnAir \n#Repost @dontae_jones_whio\n„Éª„Éª„Éª\nOur StormTracker 7 is now my mobile office.

Reports have been received by the Council that some #farmers are not adhering to #socialdistancing measures while attending livestock markets.\n\n#Councillor Mark Young, the Council\u2019s Cabinet Lead Member for #SaferCommunities, said: \u201CWe are reminding farmers of the importance of adhering to social distancing measures while attending #livestock markets and to also practice good hygiene.\n\u201CIn the current #covid19 outbreak it is vital to act responsibly and to follow guidelines to help prevent local outbreaks.\n\u201CThe majority of #farmers are following #guidelines and we thank them as we all work together to reduce the risk of coronavirus from spreading and keeping our communities safe.\n\n\u201CWe have been working with #livestock markets who have worked hard to ensure measures are in place to make it as easy as possible to follow regulations and #keepsafe\n\u201CWe would also remind people to follow #WelshGovernment and Public Health Wales guidelines and #selfisolate if they have been in contact with a case or suspected case of coronavirus. They should also get themselves tested.\u201D\n\n#FUW President Glyn Roberts said: \"Failure to abide by the rules risks people's lives, and risks seeing the authorities closing markets down at a critical trading time for the #farming industry. This cannot be allowed to happen and for the sake of our industry and the welfare of those who work in it I would urge everyone to act responsibly and abide by the rules.\"\n\n#NFU Cymru County Adviser for #Clwyd, Joe Mault said: \u201CThe threat from #Coronavirus in #Wales has not gone away. We strongly urge all members of the farming community to continue to rigorously follow social distancing rules be it on farm, when they visit other businesses or the auctions market.\n\u201CThe trade in our local markets is essential to both the production and supply chains, and any further disruption to this could have a detrimental impact on the wider industry.","NumberOfLikes":10,"Hashtags":["#WelshFarmingCommunity","#Denbighshire","#farmers","#DenbighshireCountyCouncil","#farmingunions","#livestock","#farmers","#socialdistancing","#Councillor","#SaferCommunities,","#livestock","#covid19","#farmers","#guidelines","#livestock","#keepsafe","#WelshGovernment","#selfisolate","#FUW","#farming","#NFU","#Clwyd,","#Coronavirus","#Wales"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Cllr Mark Young (ChocShop) in Denbighshire County Council.
