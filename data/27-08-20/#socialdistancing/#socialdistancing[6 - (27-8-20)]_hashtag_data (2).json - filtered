Even if you don\u2019t have any overt symptoms after you have some dairy, you could have a more subtle sensitivity that\u2019s causing some inflammation. This inflammation could be causing water retention and stopping you from losing body fat. \n* \tYou\u2019re eating too much of it and it\u2019s easy to do. Most dairy is calorie dense.

Quando estudamos sozinhos, se manter motivado é mais difícil, e, nesses tempos de pandemia, o grau de dificuldade aumentou ainda mais. Vamos às dicas!\n\u2022\n× ESTABELEÇA UMA ROTINA: rotinas são ótimas para criar ou manter um hábito, e o mesmo vale para motivação. \n× LUZ SOLAR: eu sou suspeita pra falar, pois nem sempre consigo encaixar os estudos durante o dia, mas geralmente estamos mais dispostos durante o dia, e isso ajuda na motivação.\n× MUDE DE LUGAR: estudar sempre no mesmo lugar pode ser cansativo, então tente mudar os ambientes de vez em quando.\n× DIVERSIFIQUE: se a sua rotina atual não te deixa feliz, por que não tentar mudar umas coisinhas? Isso pode te deixar mais motivado!\n\u2022\nGostou do post? Curta e comente!\n\u2022\n[🇺🇸] When studying alone, keeping yourself motivated is hard stuff, and it doesn't make it easier the fact that we're in a pandemic. Let's see some tips!\n\u2022\n× STABLISH A ROUTINE: routines are good to make and keep habits and the same goes for motivation.\n× SUN LIGHT: i'm not mankind's spokesperson, especially cause i can almost never study during the day, but usually we're more active in the day, and this also goes with motivation.\n× SWITCH PLACES: studying in the same place can be boring, so change location every once in a while. \n× SPICE THINGS UP: if your current habits don't make you happy, why not change some aspects of it? It might make a bit more motivated!\n\u2022\nDid you enjoy the post? Like and comment!","NumberOfLikes":27,"Hashtags":["#ANPANTIPS]"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by julia 주리 on August 25, 2020.

Some who seem to be more successful, more motivated, and far happier about literally EVERYTHING! But what people post on social media is typically just a brief moment of their lives -- & I MUST REMEMBER THAT...no one posts about the horrible fight they had with their spouse or that their struggling with work, or with money, whatever hardships happen. Im setting myself up for unhappiness by comparing myself to these seemingly \"perfect\" people with perfect lives, which is so far from reality! If we acknowledge that social media is not completely realistic, we can begin to disconnect what we see online with real-life expectations. Learning to separate social media from our sense of self-worth.

Is there someone you can highlight in your local community? When we can shine the light on others it\u2019s a win-win. \nStay in your lane, be respectful. \nUse social media as a way to be helpful. Look for opportunities within your local community to be a helper. Real estate agents are such a huge resource to their communities, do what you can to provide helpful information to your community.\n.\n🚫Don\u2019t: Mindlessly share \u2013 think before you share. Read beyond the headline. Before you click share, watch the entire video or read the entire article and also check the resource to make sure it\u2019s coming from a reputable source. Also, be careful why funny memes\/jokes. I\u2019m not necessarily saying don\u2019t be funny, just be careful. Be mindful that a lot of people are really scared right now. Instead of sharing a meme, try turning the humor on yourself.  Lastly, don\u2019t be  unprofessional. It\u2019s okay to share your opinions, just do so respectfully and professionally. \n.\nWhat are your thoughts? Agree\/disagree?

Wir werden bewusster zusammenkommen. Weil wir gelernt haben, wie wertvoll eigentlich das Zusammenkommen ist - sowohl in Person als auch virtuell. Kommunikationswege haben sich verändert und verkürzt. Alles passiert schneller, flexibler, zeitunabhängiger. Aber auch der #Austausch und das #Netzwerken? Wir beide haben unseren aktuellen #Job bei der #DB in Zeiten des Home Office angetreten und schnell gelernt, dass ohne einen Austausch das Gefühl von #Orientierungslosigkeit und #Leere entstehen kann. Eine Verabredung zum #Lunch oder #Coffee hilft- und geht auch virtuell! Da uns das Homeoffice noch länger begleiten wird, ist es essenziell, die Bedeutung des Netzwerkens in Zeiten von Corona zu sehen und zu verstehen. \n▪️#Challenge\nDaher möchten wir Euch zu einer #offline und #online challenge herausfordern: Offline möchten wir Euch ermutigen, Euch einen Monat lang mindestens einmal pro Woche bewusst mit ausgewählten Kollegen oder Geschäftspartnern zum #Lunch oder #Kaffee zu verabreden. Online laden wir Euch zum virtuellen #coffeedate in der #tagfcommunity ein! Lernt Euch kennen & vernetzt Euch bei einem #virtualcoffeetalk. Wir unterstützen Euch gerne dabei, koordinieren die Gespräche und nehmen auch selbst gerne teil. Kommentiert einfach unter dem Post oder schickt uns eine PN, wenn ihr Lust habt, bei unserer virtuellen #Community Netzwerkidee dabei zu sein. Wer weiß, welche neuen Ansätze, Ideen oder Impulse sich dabei entwickeln können!? \n▪️Heute ist Dein #tagf.\n\n#femalefounder #newwork #femalenetworking #ffm #startup  #psychology #socialdistancing #businessmotivation","NumberOfLikes":53,"Hashtags":["#remotework","#homeoffice","#Austausch","#Netzwerken?","#Job","#DB","#Orientierungslosigkeit","#Leere","#Lunch","#Coffee","#Challenge","#offline","#online","#Lunch","#Kaffee","#coffeedate","#tagfcommunity","#virtualcoffeetalk.","#Community","#tagf.","#femalefounder","#newwork","#femalenetworking","#ffm","#startup","#psychology","#socialdistancing","#businessmotivation"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Selina & Florentina in Frankfurt, Germany with @tag_femme.

It's when someone fakes having progressive views to date you. Check out our post on 4 signs to look out for and what it is... Link in bio ❤️ Have you experience wokefishing? Let us know how you handled it in the comments!\n\nWe\u2019ve all heard of the common dating trends, ghosting, breadcrumbing,catfishing, kittenfishing\u2026 the list is endless. Well, there\u2019s a new \u2018trend\u2019 doing the rounds at the moment that we have to talk about. You may have already heard of it, or experienced it and not known it had a name. I am, of course, talking about wokefishing. \u2018Woke\u2026 whatnow?!\u2019 I hear you saying, faces screwed up in pure confusion. Well, let me educate you. Take a seat, class is in session. According to the trusty platform, Urban Dictionary, wokefishing \u2018is when a man, whom is talking to a woman, starts asking her vague questions regarding progressive causes, in an effort to determine her interest level, and then mirror her responses. Said man has no interest in the same groups or causes, and is just trying to find commonalities with the girl to get into her pants.\u2019 Yup, this is a real thing that is happening and it is on the rise, so here are 4 signs of wokefishing\u2026\n\nThey really go out of their way to consistently mention their progressive views on dating apps - This is the time when they\u2019ll really play up that they\u2019re a feminist or they support LGBTQ+ rights or BLM. Any opportunity they have to bring it up on their profile or in the chat, they will. Sure, these can be natural conversation topics but, if it is wokefishing, it\u2019ll be almost excessive. Maybe they\u2019ll even start explaining to you why the movements are important. As if you wouldn\u2019t know as an actual member of said community\u2026\n.\n.\n.\n#clikdapp #datingstories #londondating #socialdistancing #onlinedating #londonfun #timeoutlondon #loveinlockdown #datingadvice #isodating #datinglife #datingtips #bloglife #loveinlockdown #trends #wokefishing","NumberOfLikes":7,"Hashtags":["#clikdapp","#datingstories","#londondating","#socialdistancing","#onlinedating","#londonfun","#timeoutlondon","#loveinlockdown","#datingadvice","#isodating","#datinglife","#datingtips","#bloglife","#loveinlockdown","#trends","#wokefishing"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by CLiKD | Don't just date anyone on August 25, 2020.

Another virtual race in the books putting me at 147 races to date! These virtual races have definitely kept me motivated while training through these hot summer months and for that I am thankful but I truly can't wait to get back to racing! Anyone else? 🏃\u200D♀️💪Enjoying the day at my happy place; the beach. 🏖🌞\n.\n.\n#distancerunner #runningisnotcancelled #virtualrun #WomensRunningCommunity #inspiringwomenrunners #instarun #TuesdayRun #runner #socialdistancing #keepshowingup #rawthreads #7miles #catmom #marathontraining #irunthisbody #rundone #runnersofinstagram #morningmotivation #strongnotskinny #mystrongmoment #run #Boston2020 #womanrunner #riseandrun #Boston2021 #tiuxsocks #fitfam #wearetherunners #running #finishstrong","NumberOfLikes":290,"Hashtags":["#distancerunner","#runningisnotcancelled","#virtualrun","#WomensRunningCommunity","#inspiringwomenrunners","#instarun","#TuesdayRun","#runner","#socialdistancing","#keepshowingup","#rawthreads","#7miles","#catmom","#marathontraining","#irunthisbody","#rundone","#runnersofinstagram","#morningmotivation","#strongnotskinny","#mystrongmoment","#run","#Boston2020","#womanrunner","#riseandrun","#Boston2021","#tiuxsocks","#fitfam","#wearetherunners","#running","#finishstrong"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":26,"Timestamp":1598377466,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 19:44:26 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"naircare","CaptionText":"Getting ready for some self-care at #TheNairSalon with 100% Natural Clay + Seaweed like 😌","NumberOfLikes":34,"Hashtags":["#TheNairSalon"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Nair on August 25, 2020.
