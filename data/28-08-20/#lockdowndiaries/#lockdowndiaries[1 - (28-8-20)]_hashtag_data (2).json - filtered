We\u2019ve been together in it and we\u2019ve made memories in it and that is the most important thing right?\n\nWhen Robyn @handsketchedbyrobyn messaged me about her sketch\u2019s I fell in love with them. Her detail is stunning and after failing to produce a time capsule of our lockdown memories (another plan that didn\u2019t quite make it to fruition 😄) I thought why not remember our home from where we appreciated it the most - our garden.\n\nI simply photographed this view and sent it to Robyn. I have to say she has brought our lockdown chaos to life in such a perfect way. When I look at it, it will be my constant reminder to let go of perfection and just slow down.\n\nIf you would like a sketch of your home or of somewhere that means the world to you, please head on over to @handsketchedbyrobyn . She is the loveliest and will not disappoint! She has also given me a code - FAVOURITE1 which will get you a wonderful 10% discount at the checkout. Follow the link in her bio. If you do go for one I would love to see your sketches after Robyn has worked her magic on them. They would make such a beautiful gift to yourself or to others 😍","NumberOfLikes":56,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Charlotte Robson | Cheshire in Nantwich with @tkmaxxuk, and @handsketchedbyrobyn.

Although, we were aware that there will be a comma which is going to arrive in our lives but we didn't expect it to be such a long pause. You did become an unnecessary pause of our beautiful song called \"life\"\n At the beginning, it didn't seem to be this major issue instead we were hoping to enjoy those few days of leisure and get an escape from all the hustle. But life doesn't move as you want it to, so all the plans and enjoyment were doomed by your presence. We couldn't be able to do what we wanted, we wanted to live but you forced us to turn on the survival mode, more than a master of our own self we became a slave of your existence.\n The pressure was building on each one of us to try and get back to the normal but you made us realise that there won't be any normal, atleast for now or maybe ever. Now your presence has began to haunt people, some couldn't get bread while others are still on the survival mode. \n  There has been a lot of hatred for you, but just looking at that moonlight amidst those dark clouds helped me understand that maybe just for a mere instance some of your perks are somewhat a blessing in disguise. I know everything went from bright to dull in these past few months but you made us realise that there is something which is more important than those rush of life and that is our family and friends. You made us perceive the fact that there presence is of the utmost importance in our life, you enlarged everything in life for us and made us believe that all those things we were directly or indirectly taking for granted is an absolute luxury for us and we can't thank you enough for that. By pushing us at the end of the darkness you made us look at the brighter side of few things\nContinued in comments....","NumberOfLikes":16,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The Perennial in India.

We as humans can feel what others feel just by imagining it, just by watching a movie, that emotional trigger is set off\u2063\n\u2063\n🌟 There is a deeper part of us which wants to know that the other person is okay, and that we are okay. But sometimes it's forgotten through greed, jealously, inadequacy, hatred, rage.\u2063\n\u2063\n🌟 These can consume us and make us sick more than the corona virus, because its an ongoing sickness. Once you let compassion flood your system, and look at the world from this point of view. You will have direct positive.physiological changes, yes it's been shown in studies!\u2063\n\u2063\n🌟 You literally become better when put yourself in someone's shoes, and when you deeply feel their pain and their joy.\u2063\n\u2063\n🌟 We have all practiced compassion over lockdown in one way or another, sharing the burden, sharing how our experiences have gone, staying safe, nobody escaped lockdown and we were all in this together. No race, no country, no nothing was there to separate us. We had something in common with everyone\u2063\n\u2063\n🌟 As you ease out of lockdown, remind yourself of this something in common that you have with humanity, and take your compassion into everything you do. Try it for a week, the next time you feel enraged that someone is attacking you, ask yourself where in that person it's coming from, now how do you feel?\u2063\n\u2063\n🚀 Let me know how your life changes in this week.

Being a part of this exhibition is a true honour as it\u2019s showing a part of history that completely changed the world. \n\nOn March 20, the International Center of Photography announced an open call for imagemakers around the world to post and tag imagery of their experiences as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded. Photojournalism and documentary pictures sit with staged and more metaphorical photographs. Amateur smartphone pictures are being uploaded alongside the work of professional imagemakers from around the world. A whole range of emotions are present: anger, despair, loss, confusion, frustration, boredom, loneliness, strength, and resolve.\nThen, on May 25, George Floyd, a Black man, was killed in Minneapolis by a white police officer and millions came out of isolation to gather in anger and defiance of centuries of systemic racism and white supremacy. Thousands of #ICPConcerned images of the demonstrations were uploaded and shared.\nNow, ICP has initiated an evolving #ICPConcerned exhibition One thousand images are being chosen by a wide range of ICP staff\u2014curators, administrators, and educators. No one can visit yet, but the process and the installation are being documented and shown online, taking the images back to the worldwide audience that made them. Eventually, the returning public will be able to come see a visual account of this tumultuous era.\n\nLink in bio\n\nImage 1  Gallery installation courtesy of International Centre Of Photography\n\nImage 2 When You Can\u2019t Get To The Nail Salon \n\n#icpconcerned #photographersinisolation #london #harrow #harrowonline #ukphotographersinisolation #isolation #photography #documentaryphotography \n#lockdown #MassIsolation #MassIsolationFORMAT #covid_19 #womenphotographers #womeninphotography #timeoutlondon #formatfestival #lensculture #documentary #originalphotographers #wsp_covid19 #quarantinephotography #quarantine #resolvedisolation #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":32,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1598376336,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 19:25:36 CEST 2020","Location":"ICP - International Center of Photography"},{"CaptionText":"Quick, delicious and a vegetarian appetizer Soya Manchurian 😋 This soya Manchurian is something you can try when you want a protein pack meal🔥\n.\n.\n #soya #manchurianrecipe  #manchurianfood  #manchurianballs #manchurian #prilaga #manchurianlove #favoritefoodever #favoritefood #quarantinecooking #quarantinelife #quarantine #lockdown  #quarantineandchill #quarantine2020 #lockdowndiaries #lockdowncooking","NumberOfLikes":22,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Utkarsha~Omkar on August 25, 2020.

And looking at this photo of Joseph, I can plainly see the little man in him as opposed to the little boy he was.\n.\nThinking about it, the changes would have happened anyway over a 6-month period; 6 months is a lot in kids-time. The difference is that usually we are too busy to notice it. But in lockdown? In lockdown I noticed every change, every new word in their vocabulary, every new skill, every new inch of hair, every new cheekiness, every new made up game. I had the privilege of noticing it all.\n.\nAs much as I loved being able to go on holiday and the prospect of still having a job, I'm starting to mourn the lockdown life - what it represented for family life. As hard as it was, all the resentment in working so hard, never getting a break, no childcare... I'm simply starting to mourn the slow mornings, easy breakfasts, late night films, pijama days and no make up zoom meetings.\n.\nI know so many are starting to chase dreams to continue this slow life. The real question is how long will it take until we forget what it was like and we feel the need to fill our diaries again?\n.\nHere's to my little man who grew up so much right in the last six months. But I didn't blink and here he is. I saw it all and enjoyed it all for once. The good and bad... I experienced it all and I'm going to try really hard to not forget this feeling.\n.\nThe feeling of simply being there!","NumberOfLikes":169,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by 𝐆𝐚𝐛𝐢 𝐆𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐨𝐥𝐟𝐢𝐧𝐢 | 🇬🇧 🇧🇷 in Lewis of London Ice Cream Farm with @gabigandolfini, and @123presets.

The atmosphere was notable to be see with moon pouring its light on the beautiful Qutub Complex.

Then horror which we used to read in past came in reality for this generation... Pandemic. \nLockdown was imposed in short interval notice and in a snap sound of fingers, many found themselves jobless, trapped inside. Privileged as me just had to get ourselves keep confined to our spaces. Real struggle was for them whose life started daily with sunrise and bread earned by long day hard work. Now there was no work.\nAs a photographers' perspective, shoots got cancelled, project delayed or denied. After a few days of not shooting, we started searching way to pursue passion. Business meetings started on conference video calls. Few photographers came with a temporary solution of shooting on video calls. Facetime shoots, WhatsApp Call shoots, Google video shoots, Skype shoot came in existence... in a shell, Virtual Shoots. Ofcourse not good as actual shoot, but \"...dil ko khush rakhne ko ghalib ye khayal achchha hai...\", it became a trend amongst photographers.\nAfter initial denial, me too thought to give it a try. Talked to few people connected with me.

Everyone can't travel to Mumbai or Maharashtra for Ganpati Darshan during the festive season and Ganesh's arrival. I created my page for such people to meet all the idols of the Lord and attend Aartis online. I am also working as a mediator to connect people to various pandals who then take back their favorite Ganesh idol home. \n\n We live to stream the festival from different locations. We are a team of 30 and we segregate and work to capture the essence of the festival perfectly.  It is sometimes hard to travel from one place to another with our camera equipment, as Mumbai has a history of extreme waterlogging during this time. The crowd at times is a barrier for us while handling the camera or making the video.\n\n Nevertheless, there is a very different kind of energy, and that gives us the power to overcome all the problems. \nGanesh Utsav is the best time of the year for me as I travel to different Murtikars to see the making of Ganesh Ji.  It is lovely to see them intricately working on the details of the idols. The air is vivacious, and people are high-spirited with all the Dhol and Tashas to welcome the Lord, and I think that is the best part.  As I visit a lot of pandals for my page and I cover the celebration online everywhere, I get a perk of a chance to connect and chat with the Mandal and do darshan without having to stand in the queues. \n\nIn this lockdown times, the festival might not be celebrated on a large scale as we have lesser team members, and even lesser idols are being created. \nKeeping all the precautionary measures in mind, we hope to welcome Ganesha with the same warmth and love as we do every year.\n@ganpati_maza_official_ \n.\n.\n.\n.\n#ganeshchaturthi #stories #teamstoriyaan #festivalsofIndia #festivevibes #love #celebration #culture #warmth #storiyaan #storiyaanthings #storiyaanlc #ganpatibappamorya #festivalstories #livestream #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":407,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598105159,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 16:05:59 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Today has been a productive and kinda expensive day..

I learned various forms for about ten years - jazz, hip hop, salsa and a few other Latin forms, dabbled in a bit of tap and belly dancing too - but it had been a long while since I've been in dance classes or performed. \n\nIt started in February during the initial phase of social distancing, which was hard on my ten-year-old niece when we choreographed a little routine to a song we both liked. Since then Cyra, a cheerful, positive child who found enough to keep herself busy, and I have been dancing together, though physically apart. It was just intended as a fun project to keep her busy during this time at home, but it went well. A pleasant by-product was that the home video we made got picked up by some international media, including Good Morning America. Once lockdown was announced in March and we couldn\u2019t visit each other anymore, we decided to keep going, getting together each evening on a video chat to rehearse different routines. A collaborative effort, we decide a song, discuss steps and then practice them together on a video call. It is dancing for fun, but also with some structure and a goal in mind, to learn the choreography & record a video of our synchronized steps together. We have completed ten so far, recording each one and sharing them on social media with friends and family. Through this, we have bonded, shared and learned more about each other and the music. \n\n@reemkhokhar  is a writer, contributing to various Indian and international publications on travel, culture, social issues, and writes personal essays. When not scribbling furiously, she spends most of her time choral singing, baking, dancing and indulging two adopted desi dogs.\nIf you or your artist friends have a story to share, connect with us.\n.\n.\n.\n#ArtistsLockedIn \n#Artistsupportartists #ArtistsoftheWorld #Dance #Cantstopthefeeling #ArtistsofDelhi #Lockdowndiaries #DanceDiaries #Jazz #HipHop #Togetherness #Saturdaydancemoves #saturdaynight #Adoseofhappiness #Sunshineinmypocket","NumberOfLikes":15,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1598095843,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 13:30:43 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"It's a simple platter of chole with rotis!

Srishti was independent, conscious, accomodating. A child at the age of 2 could express if she was hungry or not. Didi never treated her as junior or any less in wisdom than anyone.

They are aware of wrong and right, we need to show them the path. \n.\nNo, I have not seen or met any child as accomodating as her.

His family is a survivor of the war in Vietnam, distorted fragments of which is seen in what follows their survival. For a story this short, the topics branched bears quite some weight.\n\nOcean Vuong explores language on both a micro and macro level. A sense of poetry flows down in the writing (not surprising considering Ocean Voung is widely popular for his poems!), streaming across subjects of sexuality, race, gender, masculinity, grief and language. \n\nPlease give this a read. This is simple beauty of words, fear and ache, memory and survival, existence. \n\nCurrent goodreads rating: 4.05, and a delightful 10 for me! 💕\n#onearthwerebrieflygorgeous #oceanvuong #asianwriters #vietnamwar #motherandsonbond #lockdowndiaries #americandream #warfiction #warfictionbooks #existentialism #existentialcrisis #queerpride #queerbooks #conscioussexuality #masculinity #goodreads #goodreadschallenge2020","NumberOfLikes":35,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by \u2022 The Lavelle Library \u2022 on August 21, 2020 tagging @ocean_vuong.","NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1598033490,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 20:11:30 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"शिक्षकांविषयी आणखी पोस्ट वाचण्यासाठी नक्की फाॅलो करा @shikshak_premi \n.\n\n#teachers #lockdowndiaries #marathilines❤ #jokes #professor #sir #madam #school #god","NumberOfLikes":43,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by शिक्षक प्रेमी on August 21, 2020 tagging @pustakch, @s_h_a_d_e_s_o_f_l_o_v_e, @shikshak_premi, @insidemarathibooks, and @anolakhi_vat_.
