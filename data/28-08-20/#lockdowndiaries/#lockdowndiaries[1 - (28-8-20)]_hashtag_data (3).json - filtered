I also chopped up a golden kiwi, whipped it with some cream and milk powder to make a sweetish fruity mix. I crushed Marie biscuits with my mortar and pestle, poured a layer at the bottom of the glass. If I had some orange juice I would've added a spritz but I didn't, so just lined the sides with kiwi slices, layered on the kiwi cream in the middle, and topped it up with the dark chocolate, another layer of kiwi cream and a thin layer of the molten chocolate swirled using a toothpick.

Despite the pressure of financial instability, the lockdown has given me the space and time to work on my art without needing to meet social engagements that I would rather avoid anyway. Of course, there have been sources of frustration. Income is unpredictable, particularly as I used to depend on workshops at schools and libraries in a pre-Covid world. Writing fiction for a living is a joke, and performers are practically expected to perform \u201Cfor exposure\u201D. Additionally, I had two new books release just pre-lockdown, books that suddenly could not be distributed or promoted. With bookshops shut and book events out of the question, I floundered for a bit. Yet, things moved online, and I soon discovered that online events work well, perhaps even better than physical events, for a book sale is just a couple of clicks away!\nWithout all the time spent on travelling to conduct workshops, I\u2019ve also found myself writing more and more. Online dance classes are a new experience and though I have neither created nor learnt anything new in this time, dance keeps me active at a time when it is easy for lethargy to set in. I enjoy dancing in my own space, practising, and keeping my body active and alert. With the energy that dance brings, I write. To be honest, this is a time I\u2019ve loved. I\u2019ve been lucky to have found other projects to keep me going financially, and I\u2019ve had more time to write fiction than ever before!\n\n@varshaseshan  is a children\u2019s author and a classical dancer. She has written 19 books for\nchildren and has twice been shortlisted for the Scholastic Asian Book Award. She has been\npractising Bharatanatyam for over 25 years, and has performed extensively in India and abroad. \nIf you or your artist friends have a story to share, connect with us.\n.\n.\n.\n#Artistslockedin \n#Artistsoftheworld #artistsupportartists #artistsofPune #authors #dance #dancersdairies #lockdowndiaries #childrensbooks #danceonline #authorsofinstagram #writingmystory #artescape","NumberOfLikes":21,"Hashtags":["#Artistslockedin","#Artistsoftheworld","#artistsupportartists","#artistsofPune","#authors","#dance","#dancersdairies","#lockdowndiaries","#childrensbooks","#danceonline","#authorsofinstagram","#writingmystory","#artescape"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598614239,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 28 13:30:39 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Kya bolti hai public iss baare me?üòÇ\n.\n.\n.\n#kpopmemes, #btsmemes, #memes4ever, #memesfunny, #memesbrasil, #memesbrasileiros, #memes, #lockdowncrafts, #lockdownfitness, #lockdownwedding, #lockdownindia, #lockdowndiaries, #lockdownrecipes, #lockdownmemes, #viratkohlimotivation, #viratkohliofficiall, #viratkohliuniverse, #viratkohliforever, #viratkohlifanclub18, #viratkohli18, #viratkohlifanpage","NumberOfLikes":24,"Hashtags":["#kpopmemes,","#btsmemes,","#memes4ever,","#memesfunny,","#memesbrasil,","#memesbrasileiros,","#memes,","#lockdowncrafts,","#lockdownfitness,","#lockdownwedding,","#lockdownindia,","#lockdowndiaries,","#lockdownrecipes,","#lockdownmemes,","#viratkohlimotivation,","#viratkohliofficiall,","#viratkohliuniverse,","#viratkohliforever,","#viratkohlifanclub18,","#viratkohli18,","#viratkohlifanpage"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Memes | 18+ üîû üîµ on August 28, 2020 tagging @anushkasharma, @virat.kohli, and @singleguyforever.

As we move from summer to autumn, I ponder if there is much difference in this seasons living in Scotland \u2013 the weather can be debatable at times, but the plants and trees tell me yes there is a transition.\n\nIt has been a privilege to have the time, on my daily constitutional walk (at the start only 1-hour mind), to take in the beauty of the local countryside while in lockdown, never did I think in March that it would be August before things started to get back to the new \u2018normal\u2019.\n\nThose first months with the sun shining, listening to podcasts while walking and taking photos of the trees and plants as they emerged from their winter sleep, new shoots and buds followed by their vibrant colours as they sprang open in response to the heat and glorious sunshine we enjoyed, as I walked I took in the beauty of it all. It brought new dimensions to my homeopathic practice as I identified plants and matched them to remedy profiles.\n\nWhat will I miss about lockdown? The time it gave me not to be rushed or having to rush around, the time to potter in the garden, the free and paid online training (nice not to have to travel, clocking over 100 hours of training and updating knowledge), conversations with the neighbours, the peace from no traffic or planes going overhead, my daily walks\/cycles, watching the sunsets.\n\nWhat am I enjoying after lockdown? Having returned to face to face work at the end of July, the joy of seeing previous clients and welcoming new clients and making them feel better, structure to the day, increased motivation, getting to go out a bit more with friends and family and less queues for the shops!\n\nAnd did I finish the book?

How sweet is that! \n.\nMy earliest memories of these little golden rings is from the time slot of childhood in Solan, Himachal Pradesh. After Sunday Church Service in a tiny chapel inside our school, my parents would walk us 3 ducklings along into the market. Then into a little street off to the left, a mithaiwalla stirring his kadhai of glistening oil, scooping out huge Punjabi samosas, like a magician from a cauldron. Inside his shop, in a setup of maybe 4 tables with 4 chairs each, my father would get us either the samosas with tangy imli chutney (so typically north Indian), or the hot jalebis in a katori with milk. Sometimes both. Oh happy days! \n.\nJalebis in hot milk. Delicious beyond dreams.\n.\nAlso known as zulbia, jilapi, mushabak and zalabia, JALEBI is an Arab & Indian sweet snack popular all over South Asia, and the Middle East. It is made by deep-frying all-purpose flour batter in circular shapes, which are then soaked in sugar syrup. This dessert can be served warm or cold.\n.\n.\nExperiments in the time of Covid19.
