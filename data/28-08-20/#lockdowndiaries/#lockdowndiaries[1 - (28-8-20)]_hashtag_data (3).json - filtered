I crushed Marie biscuits with my mortar and pestle, poured a layer at the bottom of the glass. If I had some orange juice I would've added a spritz but I didn't, so just lined the sides with kiwi slices, layered on the kiwi cream in the middle, and topped it up with the dark chocolate, another layer of kiwi cream and a thin layer of the molten chocolate swirled using a toothpick.

He is now planning to have the tip of his nose removed and his eyeballs tattooed.\n\nAs per reports, Sandro's interest in extreme body modifications developed in 2007 when he saw someone on TV who had spikes implanted in their head.\n\nHe accepts that making such extreme changes to his appearance has had effects on his job and relationships. Sandro said that his friends and family consider him a \"sick freak\", but he does not care.

Despite the pressure of financial instability, the lockdown has given me the space and time to work on my art without needing to meet social engagements that I would rather avoid anyway. Of course, there have been sources of frustration. Income is unpredictable, particularly as I used to depend on workshops at schools and libraries in a pre-Covid world. Writing fiction for a living is a joke, and performers are practically expected to perform \u201Cfor exposure\u201D. Additionally, I had two new books release just pre-lockdown, books that suddenly could not be distributed or promoted. With bookshops shut and book events out of the question, I floundered for a bit. Yet, things moved online, and I soon discovered that online events work well, perhaps even better than physical events, for a book sale is just a couple of clicks away!\nWithout all the time spent on travelling to conduct workshops, I\u2019ve also found myself writing more and more. Online dance classes are a new experience and though I have neither created nor learnt anything new in this time, dance keeps me active at a time when it is easy for lethargy to set in. I enjoy dancing in my own space, practising, and keeping my body active and alert. With the energy that dance brings, I write. To be honest, this is a time I\u2019ve loved. I\u2019ve been lucky to have found other projects to keep me going financially, and I\u2019ve had more time to write fiction than ever before!\n\n@varshaseshan  is a children\u2019s author and a classical dancer. She has written 19 books for\nchildren and has twice been shortlisted for the Scholastic Asian Book Award. She has been\npractising Bharatanatyam for over 25 years, and has performed extensively in India and abroad. \nIf you or your artist friends have a story to share, connect with us.\n.\n.\n.\n#Artistslockedin \n#Artistsoftheworld #artistsupportartists #artistsofPune #authors #dance #dancersdairies #lockdowndiaries #childrensbooks #danceonline #authorsofinstagram #writingmystory #artescape","NumberOfLikes":21,"Hashtags":["#Artistslockedin","#Artistsoftheworld","#artistsupportartists","#artistsofPune","#authors","#dance","#dancersdairies","#lockdowndiaries","#childrensbooks","#danceonline","#authorsofinstagram","#writingmystory","#artescape"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598614239,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 28 13:30:39 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Kya bolti hai public iss baare me?😂\n.\n.\n.\n#kpopmemes, #btsmemes, #memes4ever, #memesfunny, #memesbrasil, #memesbrasileiros, #memes, #lockdowncrafts, #lockdownfitness, #lockdownwedding, #lockdownindia, #lockdowndiaries, #lockdownrecipes, #lockdownmemes, #viratkohlimotivation, #viratkohliofficiall, #viratkohliuniverse, #viratkohliforever, #viratkohlifanclub18, #viratkohli18, #viratkohlifanpage","NumberOfLikes":24,"Hashtags":["#kpopmemes,","#btsmemes,","#memes4ever,","#memesfunny,","#memesbrasil,","#memesbrasileiros,","#memes,","#lockdowncrafts,","#lockdownfitness,","#lockdownwedding,","#lockdownindia,","#lockdowndiaries,","#lockdownrecipes,","#lockdownmemes,","#viratkohlimotivation,","#viratkohliofficiall,","#viratkohliuniverse,","#viratkohliforever,","#viratkohlifanclub18,","#viratkohli18,","#viratkohlifanpage"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Memes | 18+ 🔞 🔵 on August 28, 2020 tagging @anushkasharma, @virat.kohli, and @singleguyforever.

She remembers that summer to be SUPER HOT. 🔥🔥🔥\n.\nWe did Whatsapp giggles 🤭🤣 over how our laundry would dry within an hour 👚👖 but was like cardboard because the weather was so devoid of moisture. And how summer flies would descend like locusts (OK that's an exaggeration) and annoy the hell out of us. #@\u203C️😣😠🙄\n.\nAfter our chat, I found myself thinking, why didn't we have a handbook 📖 that would've prepared us better for our new environment? I'm sure there was enough collective knowledge around to know the initial challenges visitors and new migrants alike would be facing in the first few weeks after arrival... knowledge that would have made the whole transition much easier. 😢\n.\nNot much good pondering that now, unless we had a time machine ⏰🕰. But with so much of the world being plunged into a new environment atm, I'm sure we're all looking for a handbook or two that can help (haircuts during lockdowns, anyone? 💇🏻\u200D♀️). Having said that, I'm positive everyone has a handbook in them that can help someone else right now.\n.\nSo have a think\u2026🤔is there someone in your world who could be helped by some of your insights atm?

We\u2019ve been together in it and we\u2019ve made memories in it and that is the most important thing right?\n\nWhen Robyn @handsketchedbyrobyn messaged me about her sketch\u2019s I fell in love with them. Her detail is stunning and after failing to produce a time capsule of our lockdown memories (another plan that didn\u2019t quite make it to fruition 😄) I thought why not remember our home from where we appreciated it the most - our garden.\n\nI simply photographed this view and sent it to Robyn. I have to say she has brought our lockdown chaos to life in such a perfect way. When I look at it, it will be my constant reminder to let go of perfection and just slow down.\n\nIf you would like a sketch of your home or of somewhere that means the world to you, please head on over to @handsketchedbyrobyn . She is the loveliest and will not disappoint! She has also given me a code - FAVOURITE1 which will get you a wonderful 10% discount at the checkout. Follow the link in her bio. If you do go for one I would love to see your sketches after Robyn has worked her magic on them. They would make such a beautiful gift to yourself or to others 😍","NumberOfLikes":68,"Hashtags":["#AD"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Charlotte Robson | Cheshire in Nantwich with @tkmaxxuk, and @handsketchedbyrobyn.

As we move from summer to autumn, I ponder if there is much difference in this seasons living in Scotland \u2013 the weather can be debatable at times, but the plants and trees tell me yes there is a transition.\n\nIt has been a privilege to have the time, on my daily constitutional walk (at the start only 1-hour mind), to take in the beauty of the local countryside while in lockdown, never did I think in March that it would be August before things started to get back to the new \u2018normal\u2019.\n\nThose first months with the sun shining, listening to podcasts while walking and taking photos of the trees and plants as they emerged from their winter sleep, new shoots and buds followed by their vibrant colours as they sprang open in response to the heat and glorious sunshine we enjoyed, as I walked I took in the beauty of it all. It brought new dimensions to my homeopathic practice as I identified plants and matched them to remedy profiles.\n\nWhat will I miss about lockdown? The time it gave me not to be rushed or having to rush around, the time to potter in the garden, the free and paid online training (nice not to have to travel, clocking over 100 hours of training and updating knowledge), conversations with the neighbours, the peace from no traffic or planes going overhead, my daily walks\/cycles, watching the sunsets.\n\nWhat am I enjoying after lockdown? Having returned to face to face work at the end of July, the joy of seeing previous clients and welcoming new clients and making them feel better, structure to the day, increased motivation, getting to go out a bit more with friends and family and less queues for the shops!\n\nAnd did I finish the book?

The time to share a chat with neighbours that we hardly ever spoke to before and the real camaraderie of sharing and helping one another is one that I hope will last into the future, it has been so comforting to know that others too have the time to converse and are willing to do so, rather than racing off to face another working day.

How sweet is that! \n.\nMy earliest memories of these little golden rings is from the time slot of childhood in Solan, Himachal Pradesh. After Sunday Church Service in a tiny chapel inside our school, my parents would walk us 3 ducklings along into the market. Then into a little street off to the left, a mithaiwalla stirring his kadhai of glistening oil, scooping out huge Punjabi samosas, like a magician from a cauldron. Inside his shop, in a setup of maybe 4 tables with 4 chairs each, my father would get us either the samosas with tangy imli chutney (so typically north Indian), or the hot jalebis in a katori with milk. Sometimes both. Oh happy days! \n.\nJalebis in hot milk. Delicious beyond dreams.\n.\nAlso known as zulbia, jilapi, mushabak and zalabia, JALEBI is an Arab & Indian sweet snack popular all over South Asia, and the Middle East. It is made by deep-frying all-purpose flour batter in circular shapes, which are then soaked in sugar syrup. This dessert can be served warm or cold.\n.\n.\nExperiments in the time of Covid19.
