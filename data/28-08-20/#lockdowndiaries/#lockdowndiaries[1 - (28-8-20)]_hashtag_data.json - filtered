Throw in a beach and some palm trees 🏝 and well....!\u2060\n\u2060\nAfter a day at school, often in the evenings mum would come back home from work or daily chores and we\u2019d drive for a not-so-cheeky pre-dinner snack to what used to be a promenade area not far from home known to locals as \u201CLighthouse\u201D. Recognising the car, street vendors would often descend upon us enticing us with hot BBQ\u2019d \u2018makai\u2019 (corn on the cob 🌽), grilled or friend \u2018muhogo\u2019 or \u2018mogo\u2019 (cassava), \u2018vyazi tamu\u2019 (sweet potato 🍠) all wrapped up in crumpled \u2018gazeti\u2019 (newspaper)- not to forget the juicy \u2018madafu\u2019 (coconuts🧉). We\u2019d enjoy our mini feast whilst watching the waves crash against the cliff edge.\u2060\n\u2060\nSundays were often a treat as this would be my pops\u2019 only day off in the week. He loved a good drive out, regardless of the mini passengers arguing over music choices. We\u2019d hop into the car and spend the day at the beach where there was usually a \u2018kokoteni\u2019 (wooden kart) vendor parked up with more coconuts and one of my favourites, \u2018maembe\u2019 (mangoes 🥭) with a sprinkling of chilli powder, salt & lime. Sometimes whole, sometimes shredded up and smushed in a small plastic bag for slurping up. Yes, I did it 🙋🏽\u200D♀️ and there\u2019s no better feeling!\u2060\n\u2060\nLast week seems like a distant memory, but these moments are as vivid as day.

Although, we were aware that there will be a comma which is going to arrive in our lives but we didn't expect it to be such a long pause. You did become an unnecessary pause of our beautiful song called \"life\"\n At the beginning, it didn't seem to be this major issue instead we were hoping to enjoy those few days of leisure and get an escape from all the hustle. But life doesn't move as you want it to, so all the plans and enjoyment were doomed by your presence. We couldn't be able to do what we wanted, we wanted to live but you forced us to turn on the survival mode, more than a master of our own self we became a slave of your existence.\n The pressure was building on each one of us to try and get back to the normal but you made us realise that there won't be any normal, atleast for now or maybe ever. Now your presence has began to haunt people, some couldn't get bread while others are still on the survival mode. \n  There has been a lot of hatred for you, but just looking at that moonlight amidst those dark clouds helped me understand that maybe just for a mere instance some of your perks are somewhat a blessing in disguise. I know everything went from bright to dull in these past few months but you made us realise that there is something which is more important than those rush of life and that is our family and friends. You made us perceive the fact that there presence is of the utmost importance in our life, you enlarged everything in life for us and made us believe that all those things we were directly or indirectly taking for granted is an absolute luxury for us and we can't thank you enough for that. By pushing us at the end of the darkness you made us look at the brighter side of few things\nContinued in comments....","NumberOfLikes":16,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The Perennial in India.

I cannot get enough of them. This is one of my favourite wedding pictures, because my face reflects the seriousness of the committment we made that day and I remember this moment just looking at him and thinking: I've found you. \n\n*** \n\nI had such a good time washing the dishes yesterday and playing Afrikaans sokkie music with Yoda looking on with a very confused face. I thought back on the Potch years and all the memories made. Putting music on while doing a boring task has been a life saver countless of times. \n\n*** \n\nThere is a brilliant story about a young man explaining to an elder that it feels like two wolves, black and white, are fighting in his head. He asks the elder who is going to win? The one you feed the most...\n\n***\n\nI was so upset when I saw what transpired yesterday after the fake news rumours about alcohol being banned again started circulating. Small business are having difficulty getting their invoices paid, people are letting people stay rent free in their homes, but by all that is possible, you MUST have alcohol in the house. I am trying to understand. And failing miserably. \n\n*** \n\nLoyalty is one of the most underrated character traits. I value this so much in a relationship and it is rarer than one might think. When I was a young girl, I read a quote that said small minds discuss people, great minds discuss ideas. I wanted to have a great mind (and be president), so this stuck with me. May we all dish out loyalty, royally. \n\nEnough internet for today. \n\n#lockdowndiaries #lockdown2020 #lockdown #wednesdaywisdom #thoughtsoftheday #loyalty #alcoholban #varsitydays #music #pictures #memories #memoriesmade #deardiary #therapy","NumberOfLikes":21,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Carla Gerryts on August 26, 2020.

That was the only time he was carried out of the four walls of our home. He kept observing around and knew that the shops were shut, he wouldn't get any toys or chocolates on the go, no autos or buses around. Basically he knew everything and never did once throw tantrums about getting stuff for him. He found content and happiness visiting his naanu house, playing around with our pet dog there 🐕\n\n🌿 However lately, since the lockdown has been lifted and he has observed movement around, he keeps insisting on going out for a stroll or a ride or sometimes to just look out for cows every single day 🐄\n\n🌿 This was the first time I gave in to his demand and took him out; we visited this lake close by. Baby E held my hand all the time, there was nobody around except for one boy feeding the fishes. So we waited a bit longer and watched those fishes eat their meal 🐠 Tust me, that minute all that I could see on his face were those sparkling eyes & a happy smile 😊 (even behind that mask).. \n\n..I have no idea when shall we get to our previous normal, but I do know that my 3 year young champ has been so patient & resilient all this while in the pandemic, it's something which I as an adult get to learn from him.\n\n#eveningvibes #strollingaround #lakeside #toddlerlife #toddlertales #kidsofinstagram #momlife #momblogger #microblogger #momsofinstagram #earlylearning #earlychildhood #pandemic #lockdownlife #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":41,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598440919,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 26 13:21:59 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"The most common view of our house, during the morning time these days.

While we are infinitely grateful to be sheltered in the most amazing country, we also felt like we were indefinitely putting our lives on hold. There are things we should attend to back at home. \n\nOur return date coincided with the discovery of new community transmission in Auckland. It was a rude awakening that the pandemic is long from over. New lockdown in Auckland made our exit even more anxiety inducing. I was constantly in communication with our Airbnb host to ensure we can still stay there before our flight. Of course, I also worried about our flight being canceled the last minute. Worst of all I had to scratch my original plan of restaurant hopping in the city due to everything being closed in level 3 restriction.\n\nWe spent our last day of freedom getting haircuts for everyone. I have no idea when we will be able to do this again without wearing masks and being worried about getting or giving the virus.

Usually it has all purpose flour in it but this time to make it healthy I skipped that totally, instead used maize flour and some rice flour. \nI also tried to give a twist in the form of shape and color  so rather than regular tacos we have baked beetroot Taco cups.\n\nIngredients :\nTaco cups:\nMaize flour- 1 cup\nRice flour- 1tbsp\nGram flour- 1 tbsp\nBeetroot puree- 2 tbsp( for colored tacos) \nWater-1\/2 cup for regular tortillas \nOlive oil- 2 tsp\nSalt- 1\/2 tsp\nMexican seasoning- 1 tsp\n\nGuacamole :\nAvocado - 1 mashed \nTomato- 1 diced \nOnion- 1 diced\nChopped fresh coriander\nGarlic chopped - 1tsp\nSalt - 1\/2 tsp\nPaprika- 1\/4 tsp\nLime juice- 1tsp\n\nHerbed rice, Refried beans, Mexican salsa, Cheesy curd dip, Fresh salad were other layers whose ingredients can be found in my 'Mexican Burrito Bowl' recipe. \n \nMethod:\nFor Tacos, mix everything together to make a dough. Roll it out between two parchment papers and layer it in bakeware safe bowl giving a cup shape. Bake at 180 deg C for 15 min. \nThere might be some cracks while putting it in the bowl so just add some dough to repair it😀\n\nLayer it with other ingredients and is ready to serve. \nThis recipe goes as my contribution towards #healthybakesforgram \nUnder Savoury bake theme\nHosted by @thegourmettherapy @bakeinline @food.marvels.vc @adhyayan_sahay \nSponsored by @ossoroflavours @tripti_crafteria \nFeatured by @yesindia \n\nTagging @ananyaghosh90\n@ediblestories.neha @food_feed_fiesta \nto participate. \n\n#NehaTheDentistGram\n#mexicantacos #tacosarelife #tacosbae #tacosway  #foodstylingandphotography #foodstyleguide #buzzfeedindia #foodtalkindia #wahindia #veggiebowl #foodbloggersofinstagram #healthyeatingtips #healthyrecipies #vegetariandinner #vegetarianmeals #lockdowndiaries #foodnetworkthekitchen #f52gramsfoodpic #f52community #bangalorefoodiesclub #bangalorefoodblogger #platingfood #bakingcooking #delish😋 #homechefsofinstagram #foodtalkindia #foodiesofinsta #indianfoodiesquad #foodgasms \n@wahhindia @buzzfeedindia @buzzfeedfood @yesindiafoods","NumberOfLikes":71,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":39,"Timestamp":1598411432,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 26 05:10:32 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Before, after picture of my friend monica ❤️ as well as my bride 😍\n\nAll set for her church wedding ✨\n\n✨MAKEUP, hairdo and sareedrapping by @judith_makeupartistry\n\n✨ DM for Bridal enquiry and booking ✨\n\n#judithmakeipartistry #sareelove #bridal #muhurthamlook #bridalmakeupartist #NOFILTER #lagirl #makeup #instafam #search #tutorial  #makeupartist #trending #toofaced #hudabeauty #nyxcosmetics #other #nykaacosmetics  #explore #quarantine #lockdowndiaries #reels #series #professionalmakeup  #narscosmetics #internationalmakeupartist  #morphe #makeupartistchennai","NumberOfLikes":2315,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by 𝑱𝒖𝒅𝒊𝒕𝒉 𝑴𝒂𝒌𝒆𝒖𝒑 𝑨𝒓𝒕𝒊𝒔𝒕𝒓𝒚 on August 25, 2020.

The reviews all said the layer of banana between the ice cream and the crust made it super hard to cut so I opted for bananas on top instead! \n2. Replaced the layer of banana with a layer of chocolate to keep the crust crunchy! Check out fun facts for why 🤔\n\nTips and Tricks 🧑\u200D🍳\n1. Allow each layer of ice cream to complete freeze before adding the next layer to avoid flavours mixing! We waited WAY longer than the 20 minutes called for - closer to 2 hours!\n2. A silicon cake pan is perfect to use as it makes the pie so easy to remove! \n\nFun fact 🎁\nAs a Food Scientist one of my most memorable classes was the one where we learned about chocolate coating on the inside of ice cream cones sold ready to eat (like Drumsticks or Cornetto)🍦. The coating is fat-based so forms a barrier that stops the moisture from the ice cream moving to the cone and making it soggy. It's essential to a good Drumstick or Cornetto. Those that first put them on the market spent tons of time and money on scientists 👩\u200D🔬 to figure out a way to not let the chocolate pool at the bottom of the cone, only to find out after they did that people actually love the chocolate ends! 😅 \n\n#buzzfeedtasty #cupcakeproject #bananasplitday #bananasplit #bananasplitpie #bananaspliticecreampie #icecream #pie #pies #homemadepie #homemadepies #icecreampie #neapolitan #neapolitanicecream #neopolitanicecreampie #caramelisedbanana #caramelisedbananas #caramelizedbananas #caramelizedbananas #icecream #dessert #desserts #f52gram #cookingstories2020 #cuisine_captures #f52grams #3rookiecooks #melbournefoodie #quaranteam #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":473,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":95,"Timestamp":1598361202,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 15:13:22 CEST 2020","Location":"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia"},{"CaptionText":"#Quick&EasyLunch\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n#tunacakes #LockdownDiaries #foodphotography","NumberOfLikes":10,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Potego Miranda on August 25, 2020.

And looking at this photo of Joseph, I can plainly see the little man in him as opposed to the little boy he was.\n.\nThinking about it, the changes would have happened anyway over a 6-month period; 6 months is a lot in kids-time. The difference is that usually we are too busy to notice it. But in lockdown? In lockdown I noticed every change, every new word in their vocabulary, every new skill, every new inch of hair, every new cheekiness, every new made up game. I had the privilege of noticing it all.\n.\nAs much as I loved being able to go on holiday and the prospect of still having a job, I'm starting to mourn the lockdown life - what it represented for family life. As hard as it was, all the resentment in working so hard, never getting a break, no childcare... I'm simply starting to mourn the slow mornings, easy breakfasts, late night films, pijama days and no make up zoom meetings.\n.\nI know so many are starting to chase dreams to continue this slow life. The real question is how long will it take until we forget what it was like and we feel the need to fill our diaries again?\n.\nHere's to my little man who grew up so much right in the last six months. But I didn't blink and here he is. I saw it all and enjoyed it all for once. The good and bad...

A study plan is a must!\n*\n📝You need to interact with a concept multiple times before you learn it. Revision is so important!\n*\n📝Whilst focusing on what you're trying to learn is important, \nso is giving your brain time to make connections between what you are learning and your prior knowledge. Your brain will do this on its own. Often this results in \"shower thoughts\" because these connections form whilst we are relaxing. \n*\n📝Take regular breaks. Shorter periods of study improves focus and productivity.\n*\n*\n#nzeducation #onlinetutoring #onlinelearning #ncea #chemistrymemes #chemistrynotes #kiwigold #nceamemes #studygram #studymotivation #newzealand #lockdowndiaries #independentstudy #auckland #studentlifenz #highschoolstudent #highschoolnz #getprepared #memes #nceachemistry #examtime #exammadness #nzteen  #parentinghacks #onlineclasses #highschoolsenior","NumberOfLikes":8,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Online NCEA Chem Classroom on August 24, 2020.

It is the kind of food that you can rustle together using pantry staple spices, caramelized onions, ginger and garlic paste and ready on your table in less than 40 minutes. You could propel the curry with the welcome addition of most vegetables, most commonly exploited are, gravy-soaking potatoes or tender green peas. \n.\nThere are very willing ways to serve this curry, fluffy cumin basmati rice, soft rotis or scrumptious garlic naan breads to scoop up the spicy gravy. The spiced curry is mellow and relaxed, it\u2019s imbued flavours rooted in culture, deepening over time. \n.\nPerfect when shared with good company, forget the cutlery and go fingers in. \n.\nThis recipe is from my paperback cookbook - Cooking Memorable Food with Paz, to shop, tap the link in bio\n.\nFollow @foodiesof_cakewalk for more photos and ideas\/recipes.

Call it pandemic fatigue, call it whatever you want. \n\nI miss my son happily telling me what he did at nursery and all the friends he has made. I miss him never touching an iPad or watching endless hours of TV. I miss not having to put a mask on his face. \n\nI miss my parents not being anxious. I miss seeing people\u2019s smiling faces without a mask. Not just family, but strangers in the street. \n\nI miss being busy, going to birthday parties, going out for the day somewhere nice, entering a cafe and restaurant randomly rather than pre-booking etc. \n\nI miss the normalcy. \n\nSo don\u2019t feel like you have to pretend and keep pushing through.
