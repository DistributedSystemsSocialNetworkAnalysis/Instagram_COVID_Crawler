Aber wenn etwas diesen miserablen Monat an die Grenze zur Erträglichkeit gebracht hat, dann mit imaginären Inlinern an den Füßen zu Dua Lipas \"Future Nostalgia\" am Fluss entlangzulaufen und über Discos nachzudenken, die als Ort anno 2020 ja im Grunde der Science-Fiction anheim fallen. Irgendetwas an Songs wie \"Physical\", \"Hallucinate\" oder \"Cool\" beruhigt immer wieder; wann war das letzte mal etwas so cool, das so normie war? \"Future Nostaglia\" ist das Album, für das wir all die Nostalgie-Alben um 2000 halten.

WOW what an eye opener. I now comprehend why it's so hard to explain climate change in a sentence, because you can't.\nEVERY. SINGLE. THING we do is interconnected. Every corporate decision & government policy that's geared towards ignoring the environment impacts our health today and in the future.\n.\nEven what is happening right now, Covid, has a thread to climate change.\nIt's alarming, but I believe there is a light.

In other words, if you vaccinate, you help wipe out disease that could spread now and into the future. By making sure you and your family are fully vaccinated you are not only looking after your own family but also protecting vulnerable people in your community. The more people who are vaccinated, the fewer people will be infected, and the less widely a disease can spread.Immunisation saves lives. As recently as the 1950s, thousands of children died every year from diseases such as tetanus, diphtheria and whooping cough (pertussis). Luckily, it is rare for anyone in Australia to die from these infectious diseases now, thanks to the major vaccination programs introduced in the 1960s and 1970s, which continue today.\n_\n\nVisit us at www.cowin.live\n_\n\n#cowin #global #covid19 #who#pandemic #lockdown#globalpandemic #coronavirus#HealthForAll \n#stayhome #staysafe#socialdistancing #safetymeasures#awareness #lockdowndiaries\n#quatantine #homebound#unitednations #technology #tech#TechnologyForGood #techstartup\n#techsolution #instatech #appdesign#healthcare #quarintinelife #canada#globaleconomy #indianeconomy","NumberOfLikes":10,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Collective Win on July 11, 2020.

Yep, lots of specific requirements! 🙈\n.\n📚After a lot of searching (and I really do mean a lot!), @cuddlycoo.baby.products came to the rescue! Their bookshelf is super compact yet holds sooo manyyy books. The height was perfect as well & it\u2019s super easy to assemble. No nails, screws or sharp edges - Full points on that! As luck would have it, the colour matches Karma\u2019s bunk bed! 🙌\n.\n📚We had moved out a big shelf from her room into mine and all the stuff that\u2019s now in the den used to be stored in that. Hence, it\u2019s created more floor space in her small room.\n.\nKarma sleeps on the upper bunk and lower one was anyhow being used for playing. Now it\u2019s become a designated reading & games nook. 👍\n.\n📚Watch the video (with SOUND ON cos it\u2019s more fun like that). 😉\n.\n📚I will soon share some easy hacks & tips that you can use to create storage, make a small reading corner & organise stuff. Those can be applied regardless of whether you have tons of space or not. It\u2019s all aimed at saving space & everyday maintenance so you will be able to tweak them based on your needs. 👍\n_______________________________________\n#kidsroomdecor #bunkbed #kidsbookshelf #kidsroomideas #indianmomblogger #mumbaimommyblogger #readingcorner #lockdowndiaries #bornoninstagram #declutterchallenge #cuddlycooproducts #cuddlycoobookshelf #woodenbookrack #woodenkidsproducts #woodenkidsfurniture #CuddlyCooFamily","NumberOfLikes":62,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1594477515,"LocalDate":"Sat Jul 11 16:25:15 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"\u201CCreativity is nothing but a mind set free.\u201D \u2013Torrie T.

I am fortunate enough to get my hands on these beauties in Bangalore. \n\nTraditionally, the stuffing or Pur is made with a tear jerking spicy filling using sorshe posto bata (mustard\/poppy seed paste), roasted peanuts and green chillies.

We consoled ourselves and stay put for our safety and for the sake of getting back to the old normal as soon as possible. \n\nBut now as we see more and more people stepping out - not because their livelihoods depend on it, not because the numbers in our country have dropped but simply because they are bored and suddenly the danger of the virus seems less grave than the thought of not eating Pani Puri at night - our blood boils. \n\nThis irresponsible behaviour will not only result in an increase in daily cases but the local travel sector will never fully recover from the crisis.  Foreign tourists will stay away from our country and Indians will be denied entry by various foreign countries on account of our high numbers. \n\nFinally all that we would be left to do is to keep looking back at such pictures from the past. \n\nLong story short - DAMN IT, BE MORE RESPONSIBLE.

It was cold, but utterly beautiful. The bite in the air was no match to the warmth and the hospitality of the Kashmiri folk. You felt like some were tourist traps, but it was hard not to be moved by the sincerity and genuineness of  those who were trying to sell things to you. One of the people we met was this saffron farmer, who insisted that the saffron he was selling was nothing like what you get in the big cities. We were a bit wary, but bought some anyway. As it turned out, the saffron was top notch - much stronger and flavorful than what we usually bought - just as he had said.\n\nI'd saved his number and called him last week, to ask if he could deliver some? He couldn't immediately place me, but everything in his voice was just the same - the smile, the warmth and the genuineness. He assured me he'd dispatch it the very next day, and insisted that I didn't have to pay till I received the package. I protested but gave up - he'd hear none of it. \n\nIn less than a week, it has arrived. It arrived unsurprisingly but a little heartbreakingly, by @indiapostofficial, not private courier. It had my name written by hand.\n\nHow do the Kashmiri people retain their kindness, after all that has happened to them in the last few months? How do they continue to live with hope? How do they feel about placing their trust in people who've failed them more often than stood by them? I do not know. But I'm humbled, and a bit ashamed. \n\n(If anyone wants to buy excellent saffron directly from a grower, please let me know and I can share the number)\n\n#longpost #stories #storiestotell #kashmir #kashmiri #kashmirtourism #saffron #hope #kashmiripeople #lockdowndiaries #lockdownstories #indiapost #kashmir_lovers #kashmirifood","NumberOfLikes":35,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Raghu on July 10, 2020.

Hier kommen unsere Album-Highlights der ersten Jahreshälfte. Vor einem Jahr legten wir euch an dieser Stelle eine Auswahl Platten ans Herz, die ihr dabei haben solltet, wenn der Sommerurlaub beginnt. 2020 ist diese liebgewonnene Konstante für die meisten eingedampft auf die Frage: Balkonien oder Baggersee? Aber auch dort macht das Leben mit guter Musik bekanntlich mehr Spaß. Deshalb kommen wir unseren pädagogischen Pflichten auch im Corona-Sommer nach und präsentieren euch 30 mit Bestnoten ausgezeichnete, kurzweilige, intensive, überraschende, tanzbare, meditative, zum Feiern animierende, Serotonin ausschüttende und in jedem Fall krisenerprobte Studioalben aus diesem verrückten Halbjahr. Neben all dem Elend, das uns in akustischer Form leider erneut heimgesucht hat (ihr erinnert euch), wird es jetzt höchste Zeit für die Auserwählten des Pop, Rap, Rock und Metal.

Like because you know the circumstances of the photograph it feels like you look at it differently to how you would in any normal context? I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m suppose I\u2019m quite emotionally attached to my photographs in a weird way. I feel like I see my work differently to how others do, because I look back and remember and feel how I felt at the time of making the photograph and it informs my edits - I don\u2019t know if that is a good or bad thing?? \n\nThis was taken on my first lockdown walk, I had been shielding with my Grandma and felt really scared to go out in case it would impact her in any way, but back then it was quite easy to stay 2m apart.

We've also taken much more interest in what we can garnish our gin with, what we can pair it with, and what cocktails can be made, like a lovely warming Negroni.

However, for the majority of lockdown I have only had access to a set of DB\u2019s and some resistance bands (until this barbell was kindly lent to me by @bodysocietyuk 🥰) \nBeing forced to change up my training style has made me explore new workouts that I have actually really enjoyed! I will definitely stick to incorporating more HIIT training into my routine when the gyms reopen and also try to keep up the running🏃🏽\u200D♀️ \n\nLet me know what aspects of your lockdown workouts you will be continuing with when the gyms open their doors!\n\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\n#legday #garageworkout #covidfitness #instafitness #fitnessjourney #fitnessathome #motivation #quarantineworkout #myfitnessjourney #bootyworkout #lockdownlifting #lockdowndiaries #gymreopening #gymdependenceday","NumberOfLikes":64,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ANNIE | FITNESS + BEAUTY on July 10, 2020.

It's going to be a special one so don't miss it! 🎤🎼\u2063\n\u2063\nDavid Blank, the true definition of a soul singer, grew up around music. His father, a Nigerian preacher in the small Italian town of Camerano, introduced him to singing at the age of 5. In his church\u2019s choir, the Cherubim & Seraphim (Love Divine), David learnt that music could bond people together like a family. \u2063\nGrowing up a queer, black kid in a small Italian village, he could hardly find a sense of belonging. At the age of 15, struggling to cope with the small-town mentality, he moved to London, where he completed his studies and found a new, chosen family with other kids in the quest for freedom and fulfilment. He has shared the stage with artists from all over the world and toured with @laurapausini as her backing vocalist.\u2063\n\u2063\n#MercatoMetropolitano #MMusic #LiveMusicSession #FridayFeeling #FridayVibes #IGLive #MusicSession #DavidBlank #DavidBlankMusic #DavideShorty #CoMMunity #SocialConnecting #ILoveMusic \u2063#Lockdown #Lockdowndiaries #Creativity #CreativityNeverStops #MusicLover #WeekendVibes #WeekendMood #LiveMusic #LiveMusicSession","NumberOfLikes":49,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":6,"Timestamp":1594402226,"LocalDate":"Fri Jul 10 19:30:26 CEST 2020","Location":"Mercato Metropolitano"},{"CaptionText":"#illustrationsketch #partygirl #partydressing #passiontwists #lbd #black♥ #stylised_figure #stylisedillustration #fashionstyle #fashionarts #designing #dreams #lockdowndiaries #lockdown_days🔒 #stayhome #staysafe","NumberOfLikes":13,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by TENDENZA on July 10, 2020.

Finally few years after I moved to another city for a job and started staying independently, my wish grew only stronger but I wasn't confident whether I would be able to take care of another being. When lockdown began, I decided to finally go for it without procrastinating any further because I realised one thing from this pandemic that has impacted the world to such a great extent- life is unpredictable, so you might as well start doing the things which will add joy and happiness to your life rather than keep on delaying these things for a tomorrow which we aren't even sure will ever arrive.\n\nAfter going through some adoption posts for days, I finally came across these pics and instantly fell in love with this baby.

The gyms will be opening 25th July, and while this is a good thing for most of us, there may be a few of you that are a bit nervous. And that\u2019s okay. I personally won\u2019t be going to the gym straight away as I live with my family (there\u2019s 5 of us) and 3 of them are \u2018at risk\u2019 (and I still haven\u2019t been to the pub yet either). But here\u2019s a few tips for when we do go back...\n➡️start slow - I bet the 25th July will be like January at the gym and will constantly be busy. That means it might be worth waiting a few days before you go back, and I know my gym will have live tracking on the app to see how busy it is before you go (which is a fab tool anyway)\n➡️don\u2019t expect to be where you were before - it\u2019s likely that you will have lost at least a bit of strength over lockdown (and that\u2019s okay) so don\u2019t go in ready to deadlift your PB, especially if you haven\u2019t had access to any weights throughout lockdown. Instead, go for form over weights for a few weeks until you get back into it\n➡️get prepared - (I can help soon) maybe you want to get your fitness level back to where it used to be, so use this time to utilise getting form right with little\/no weight and then you can add it on in a few weeks, that way, you\u2019ll be less likely to get an injury\n➡️get excited - I know so many of us have been waiting for the date that we can get back to the gym, and we finally have it!!\n➡️take care - the gyms have been closed for a while, so be careful with your workouts and also look after yourself and others by following the gyms after guidelines (I know my gym have emailed me there\u2019s and I\u2019m sure you can find things on their website or social media)\n.\nWhat tips do you have for returning back to the gym??💖\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#lockdown #lockdown2020 #lockdownlife #lockdowndiaries #lockdownfun #gymsareopen #backtothegym #gymsoon #tips #tipsandtricks #advice #adviceoftheday #lifeadvice #gymadvice #mytips #toptip #toptiptuesday #toptips #adviceforlife #fitnessadvice #thanksboris #fridayvibes #friday #fridaymood #lockdownmood #fridaymotivation #motivation #feelingmotivated #readytogotothegym #gymready","NumberOfLikes":34,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Fitness, Health And Wellness in Birmingham, United Kingdom.

Does anyone feel like it's been so long they've worn \"real\" clothes it's like finding a whole new wardrobe when you look at your old stuff?\n\nThis dress is ancient and I love it, I'm a proud outfit repeater. Fashion has become so disposable and this comes with a moral price. I read a post by the lovely @mamamimosauk and she explains how things are more difficult as a plus lady. I can relate so much, fast fashion is a minefield and such a hot topic, but I find I can do my bit by buying second hand where possible and simply buying less.\n\nIt's so difficult with kids too and most of my kids clothes are second hand, or hand me downs. @graceful_changes is a fantastic rental service for kids clothes from birth-3 years. All the items are organic cotton, ethnically made and the various subscriptions, makes such items accessible to all. It's a brilliant concept and in the interest of transparency I'm helping this lovely local business with social media, but I haven't been asked to post here and sadly my kids are too old for the service. I just wanted to pass on a few ideas for anyone looking to slow down their fashion.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips of favourite ethical brands? I am in no way perfect, but slowly I'm trying to make a difference. \n\nSide note: Bayswater was second hand. I'm neither perfect or made of money.\n\n***edit to include ethical finds: \n@redrouxrouge 😍❤\n@wearetala\n@wearemoutpads by my gal Lauren.

A painting I have found comfort in during this lockdown. \n\nThe original, titled, \u2018Not to be Reproduced\u2019 (La reproduction interdite) is a painting created by Rene Magritte in 1937. \n\nThis painting was commissioned by poet and Magritte patron Edward James and is considered a portrait of James although James' face is not depicted. This painting was one of three produced by Magritte for the ballroom of James' London home. \n\nThe work depicts a man standing in front of a mirror, but whereas the book on the mantelpiece is reflected correctly, the man can see only the back of his head.\n\nThe book on the mantel is a well-worn copy of Edgar Allan Poe's The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket (written here in French as Les aventures d'Arthur Gordon Pym). Poe was one of Magritte's favorite authors and he made other references to the author and his work.\n\nHowever, what facinates me the most is the idea of a title about reproduction. We think about reproduction as something that tells us the truth. Reproduction also suggests multiplicity. All of that plays into the image that we see on this canvas. It only felt appropriate thus to not post the original painting here but to post a reproduction of the original. Something kind of like an inception , I\u2019m drawing here , for my personal pleasure . Because, when I come back to this post in a few years I want to feel how I felt when I was typing this piece . Like I\u2019m pulling out fragments from memory, literature and love to carve out a reproduction of prose that my past, present and future selves are contributing towards ... \n\n#renemargrittemuseum #painters #poetsandwriters #writersoﬁnstagram #writersofcolor #arthistorynerd #paintingstudio #historyofart #lockdowndiaries #artthatinspires #edgarallanpoe #commission #artoftheday #storiestotell #history","NumberOfLikes":10,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Srishti Jayin on July 09, 2020.

Hoping to include and inspire the kids along. Got any ideas? Share them in a comment 🙂\n\nLOCKDOWN 2.0 - DAY 1\nFor today I'll just share some creations by my son who's 8 in the next few posts. He's super impressionable through television and what he sees through gaming, movies and other visual content. Much like a LOT of other kids his age. So we try and limit his time in front of the 'idiot box' as it was called earlier. But we have to accept the potential of this media generation and guide them to learn from it. And I am taking the pointer from my son to be honest. If he watches something and then we get him to switch it off. He stays in that zone mentally but then uses his creative thinking to enact or create his own versions of what he may have seen. This could be armour and swords and helmets out of cardboard, sketches and drawings or 3D craft models. \nStay tuned for my learning the art of innovative creation from my 8 year old son!\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#ART #CREATIVITY #FAMILYFUN #LOCKDOWN #INSPIRATION #LEARN #funlearning #kraftymommy #thekraftymommy #kraftykids #kidscrafts #isolationcreation #myfeelgoodfactor #lockdowndiaries #innovative #creativethinking #playlearning","NumberOfLikes":6,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The Krafty Mommy on July 09, 2020.

I had my own small world always loved or preferred being Alone .\n\nBack where the days when we had not much access to net,only source of Inspiration were books or some TV commercials or a random source.\n\nMy mom @nimipnazir being my first teacher introduced me to cursive writing at the age of six,prime reason being my sister was an infant and inorder to keep me occupied we had bght some workbooks from India.My mom was the one who told about pencil pressure control,advantages of free flow writing and keeping errors Minimalistic.\n\nBack at School we had this excellent Art Teacher Ms Reshma ,She was this adorable teacher who helped all her students ,atleast 70 percent of them to get interested into art .I always looked forward to her class once in every week as it was one different subject which our syllabus least looked into .\n\nI enjoyed doing the occasional mehendi ,mostly floral designs.I had my own style and designs where @nahla.nazir was and is the bait to this date.I have an inclination towards florals because our house was in full bloom because of my mom's green thumb magic.Nature has always been the best Inspiration.\n\nYears passed ,After one pretty decent visit to Commercial Street ,I recall this stationary store in that lane ,that's where I bought my first sketch book after a brief span of 6 years I started doodling .\n\nStarted with doodling ,mini mandalas,florals line drawings,brush calligraphy and watercolors ofcourse .Right from my mom ,my art teachers and people who supported me in the process,Everyone has inspired me to come out of my comfort zone and experiment.This is my happy space .\n\n\"Happiness is not by chance but by Choice\"-Anonymous\n\nThis is a simple floral composition inspired by @inkstruckstudio my watercolor guru.I used leftover paints to create this piece.\n\nP.C :@hamza.anoob\n\n#randommusings #watercolorfloral\n#diasies #creativemoms #latergram\n#watercolorart #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":43,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Nazia Nazir in Kochi, India.","NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1594296553,"LocalDate":"Thu Jul 09 14:09:13 CEST 2020","Location":"Kochi, India"},{"CaptionText":"Hey my friends!

This new sense of time though, made the long walks even more enjoyable. It has let me really observe the local flowers in bloom: the wild bougainvillea, the snaking wisterias, the edible petunias. While I am taken in by the exotic, I am equally in love with the flora that is simple and beautiful.\n \nI started taking pictures on my phone and decided to keep a casual flower journal. I wasn\u2019t doing it with any particular aim, but it gave me a great sense of satisfaction, greater than baking what seems to be obligatory lockdown banana bread! No matter what the plant or tree is that I am taken by, the gloom of the world -- that seems to be abundant right now \u2013 for that moment, just fades away.\u201D\n~Harshyla \n@harshyla05","NumberOfLikes":60,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":8,"Timestamp":1594296126,"LocalDate":"Thu Jul 09 14:02:06 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Life can't be perfect .. but your outfit can be..... ❤️﻿🖤❤️... #perfect #imperfect #missimperfect #instagramers #instagram #blue #jacket #white #outfits #outfitlover #kolkata #kolkatadiaries #pracheta #chiku #instadaily #instapic #instamood #xoxo #prayaman #likeitup #followforfollowback #comment #lockdowndiaries #quarantinelife","NumberOfLikes":116,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by _Pracheta_ in KOLKATA.
