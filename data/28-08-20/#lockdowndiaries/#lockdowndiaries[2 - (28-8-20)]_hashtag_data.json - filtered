That\u2019s when the city sighs, whispers, and sometimes, lets you in on its secrets. You get to see the die hard jogger, the dawn shift construction workers already at the only cafe that\u2019s open, the lone bus driver who nods at you, sometimes a bakery with warm rolls...and if you are really lucky...an early morning meeting of the dog walkers club, with the dogs, of course:) That morning in Edinburgh, I walked the Royal Mile at dawn. My teeth chattering in the cold, the gloves feeling like cellophane and my Jack Wolfskin the only reason I am alive to write this. I saw a sign heading off to a close or a Kloos, as the Scots say, to the right of the Royal Mile. I wanted to walk straight on to the castle, but I\u2019m so glad I took the detour. That was the view down the long dark corridor. The rewards truly are off the beaten path. But it was the sign that led to it, that I simply couldn\u2019t resist.

It is a real charmer when dressed up with homemade thick custard and piped, chantilly cream. It adds an honest flavour with its rich sweetness and spongy caramelised texture, suggestive of a splendid dessert. Doubly so, it can be quietly savored at tea time. \n.\nServed with a superior vanilla ice cream, this should clinch the deal for a refreshing summery dessert. This swoony South African classic never becomes outdated. Pudgy berries are a prerequisite for it\u2019s many nutrients and its sweet-tart flavour to offset the sweetness, although any seasonal fruit may be used. \n. \nIt would be considered rude to decline these marvelous saucy puds. The only honorable thing to do, is brew a pot of tea and dispense plates around the table. \n.\nThis recipe is from my ebook - In the Kitchen with Paz, to shop, click the link in bio\n.\nFollow @foodiesof_cakewalk for more photos and ideas\/recipes.

With elderly parents & a child under nine months, I felt helpless in not being some kind of human shield so they can remain unharmed. Though seeing all the suffering around, I am achingly aware of my own privilege. There seems to be a strange relationship with time. It feels more visceral than ever before but also blurred, with days merging into each other. Most of all, there is a sense of losing time.\n\nAs a response to what was happening around me & within, I started creating digital collages, one every day for about 15 days almost like traversing the stages of grief \u2013 & unwittingly the sense, mood & state of mind somewhere started to shift. These collages became an articulation of my own process of healing, both practice & an approach. What started with denial, & an awareness of the fragility of reality began to steer towards surrender- a sort of acceptance of the uncertainty. It has been difficult to let go of control but that is something I have just started to sit with & not be so afraid of. \n\nHowever naïve it might seem right now, eventually, I\u2019d like to reach a point of hope, something that Neil Gaiman writes so beautifully about:\n\u201CThere are so many fragile things\u2026Stories, like people & butterflies & songbirds' eggs & human hearts & dreams, are also fragile things, made up of nothing stronger or more lasting than twenty-six letters & a handful of punctuation marks. Or they are words on the air, composed of sounds & ideas-abstract, invisible, gone once they've been spoken - & what could be more frail than that? But some stories, small, simple ones about setting out on adventures or people doing wonders, tales of miracles & monsters, have outlasted all the people who told them, & some of them have outlasted the lands in which they were created.\u201D \n\u201COur stories will outlive us.\u201D\n\n@vasuvious is a self-trained digital artist.

I'm drooling rn!! \n\nHyderabadi biryani is a variety of biryani from Hyderabad, Telangana, India. It is prepared from rice using the dum method of cooking. \n\nTo make the best out of this recipe, chicken needs a proper marination which mainly helps to tenderize it, resulting in juicy, flavourful and soft chicken. It can be marinated the previous night and refrigerated to make the best flavourful Hyderabadi biriyani 🤤\n\nI must mention that chicken biryani is a lengthy process that needs some experience. But, you will surely master how to make perfect biryani after a couple of trials. Even though I make biryani very often, sometimes I falter. I either overcook the rice or over-fry the onions. (in the images you will see that the fried onions are darker and not golden brown😬) \n\nIt happens but there is always another day and another chance to try.

As a part of the project we were supposed to connect to any kind of art rooted in our family. My mother tells me a lot of stories about how her grandmother made her frocks and ponchos. Not very often, but I have seen my grandmother making woolen gloves, socks and sometimes she also makes carpet. I do not know how to make clothes but I tried my hands with wool embroidery and made this small piece. I learnt to make those buds from YouTube and other patterns are mere result of going with the flow.\nMade this back in May wala lockdown, didn't have proper needle and all, the struggle was real. 😰 Also instead of doing it on fabric I decided to upcycle 'plastic ko bora'.\nHad pricked my fingers so many times and let's just not talk about the untangling threads. 😶 Well overall felt good to see the textures at the end. When I showed it to my grandma she liked it, so it's a win - win 😊\n\nHow's it guys, honest opinion la? Should I make more during Lockdown 2.0? 😉\n\nP. S.

To call it a \u201Cwriter\u2019s block\u201D would be reductive; it is existential crisis, as we know it. In that sense, the lockdown has been a blessing, allowing me to express myself in a different way (for what is art if not a form of expression?). It has also served as a steady reminder, that I am more than the words I speak\/write. And so, despite well-meaning and sardonic comments alike on how I\u2019ve been \u201Ccooking a lot these days,\u201D I keep going on, simply because it is another conduit for the imaginings and imaginations within me. Using leftover crispy smashed potatoes from last night\u2019s dinner as the base for a quick papeta par edu-like dish for lunch, kind of gives me the same joy I would derive from restructuring a sentence to make more sense, or express better the things I am trying to say.

It has to be done to keep this country safe and I am 100% behind it. With that said, I had plans to visit my family back in Australia for my birthday at the end of this month, which I, of course, had to cancel when borders closed.  I was sad about it but moved forward and made other great plans with some truly special friends here. I believe in making the best out of situations that don't always go your way. So here I am all excited for a weekend of fun with friends and now we are back in lockdown and not coming out in time for those plans. I know the entire world is also being impacted by COVID and that I am not alone in this type of situation. I am trying really hard not to pity myself.  I had my afternoon of sulking and have now moved on again. I am taking this as a message from my ancestors and the universe that I need to use the time off that I was going to spend celebrating and stay home and get my work done.  I will have about a week off from work and will not be able to leave unless accessing essential services.  What does this mean? Seven consecutive days where I can focus all of my energy on my art, projects, and any other aspect of my business that needs tending to.  Instead of being sad, I am trying to be appreciative of the time and a safe and comfortable home to be able to focus and accomplish tasks towards my goals. But to be honest, deep down I'm still a bit sad about the cancelled party plans.\n\nHow has COVID impacted your life? How are you getting through these times?

Then horror which we used to read in past came in reality for this generation... Pandemic. \nLockdown was imposed in short interval notice and in a snap sound of fingers, many found themselves jobless, trapped inside. Privileged as me just had to get ourselves keep confined to our spaces. Real struggle was for them whose life started daily with sunrise and bread earned by long day hard work. Now there was no work.\nAs a photographers' perspective, shoots got cancelled, project delayed or denied. After a few days of not shooting, we started searching way to pursue passion. Business meetings started on conference video calls. Few photographers came with a temporary solution of shooting on video calls. Facetime shoots, WhatsApp Call shoots, Google video shoots, Skype shoot came in existence... in a shell, Virtual Shoots. Ofcourse not good as actual shoot, but \"...dil ko khush rakhne ko ghalib ye khayal achchha hai...\", it became a trend amongst photographers.\nAfter initial denial, me too thought to give it a try. Talked to few people connected with me.

The space was very nascent with not much development other than a massive push in the shrimp farming sector. After spending 4 months to set up a shrimp farm which hadn't been used for over 2 years I was able to turn an unused farm to a perfectly functioning one, finally putting in the seedlings for cultivation, spending multiple long nights stressing about water conditions, having quite a few crocodiles wandering into the farm. Hundreds of ferry rides later we were coasting to the finish line, when the monsoons decided to change the tune. \n\nFor three days we watched the River Mandovi rise and recede until it finally covered the entire farm and as it receded, took all the shrimp with it. Wading through waist deep water I was devastated, but wasn't ready to give up just yet. \n\nA year, multiple ferry rides, a pandemic and just the one crocodile later, I've finally got the shrimp to the size of my palm and closed up the farm for the season. It's been a good 6 months in these strange times and an interesting journey from start to finish. Now, as the monsoons make their own music, I can finally focus on my album and all the moments of Goa that I've wanted to capture through sound and photographs. The next shrimp season promises to be just as challenging and exciting!\" said Sumehr Gwalani\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#goa #lockdowndiaries #pandemic #shrimpfarm","NumberOfLikes":1316,"Hashtags":["#goa","#lockdowndiaries","#pandemic","#shrimpfarm"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":18,"Timestamp":1597727452,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 18 07:10:52 CEST 2020","Location":"Goa"},{"Owner":"the_pic_tales","CaptionText":"Everytime when i look upto the sky...i feel the sky is the ultimate art gallery just above us...\n#photography #thepictales #photooftheday #photographer #sky #skyphotography #skystagram #skyofinstagram #shadesofsky #nature #naturephotography #lockdowndiaries #skydiaries #instadaily #instagood #instavibes #shotoniphone #shotoniphone11 #appleiphone #lightroom #sun #clouds #colors #homesweethome #indiagram #delhi_diaries #delhigram","NumberOfLikes":28,"Hashtags":["#photography","#thepictales","#photooftheday","#photographer","#sky","#skyphotography","#skystagram","#skyofinstagram","#shadesofsky","#nature","#naturephotography","#lockdowndiaries","#skydiaries","#instadaily","#instagood","#instavibes","#shotoniphone","#shotoniphone11","#appleiphone","#lightroom","#sun","#clouds","#colors","#homesweethome","#indiagram","#delhi_diaries","#delhigram"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The Pic Tales in Dwarka, Delhi with @gunjandsingh_2829, @lightroom, @shotbynoxy, @apple, @n_ature_divin_e, @photoclub.in, @sky_photography_world, @m2_shooting, and @nature_exploit.

I usually start while I\u2019m preparing breakfast. Our everyday bread for the children is a very simple white loaf that I make in my KitchenAid. This is a recipe I\u2019ve been using on and off for 13 years, and is adapted from \u2018The Cook\u2019s Companion\u2019 by Stephanie Alexander. \n\nI use 1kg bread flour, 2 tbsp olive oil, 1 tbsp dry yeast, 1tsp salt and 600ml warm water. Throw it all into the bowl of the mixer and knead with the dough hook for ten minutes. Move the dough to a large oiled bowl, cover with a tea towel, and leave to rise for about an hour. Knock the dough back, divide in half and place in two oiled bread tins to rise another 30-45 mins. Bake at 220c for 25 mins. You can remove the loaves from the tins for the last five minutes of baking for a crunchier crust.\n\nI\u2019ve made this recipe using 20% wholemeal flour and 100% wholemeal and they both work well. If you want to use 100% wholemeal you may need to bake a little longer. \n\nI make pizza dough once a week for lunches, and once or twice a week I may also make buns or another bread. This morning I tried this Milk Bun recipe from @locallovely \u2018s \u2018A Basket by the Door\u2019. (This is an amazing cookbook by the way, one of my favourites!)\n\nNeither my husband or I can actually eat any of these breads I regularly bake. I\u2019m hoping to begin experimenting with gluten-free sourdough soon, but for now I make a GF cornbread every few weeks and Evan snacks on that. \n\nThe best bread that you can eat, health wise, is a long-fermented sourdough loaf. I have had seasons of regularly baking sourdough, but I\u2019ve had to accept that in my current season I can\u2019t keep a starter alive. These simple yeast breads fit into my daily routine, only require about ten minutes of hands-on preparation time, and are still a much better choice nutritionally than store bought loaves. (I\u2019d rather not feed my kids soy flour, vegetable oils and questionable additives, thanks!)\n\nLet me know your favourite bread to bake, and also if you\u2019d like more posts like this, sharing some of the details of how we feed a large family. ☺️","NumberOfLikes":102,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":22,"Timestamp":1597714249,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 18 03:30:49 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"eatmattersph","CaptionText":"Here\u2019s a list of all the #local producers I #love & #support \u202C\nNot in the malls.

It is highly impossible to grasp the complete picture in a single sight in order to decode it. \nHence, half knowledge is equal to incomplete picture and therefore we seek enlightenment for complete understanding of this universe.\n.\n\nSometimes I unnecessarily dive deep into these boring subjects for no good reason.😁 \nWell, I did these bookmarks a while back🐰\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#amatureart #bookmarks #bookloversday\n#lovetoread #quotes🖋 #wisdomtree #lovequotes #quoteslover  #watercolourart #aquarelleart\n#aquarelleillustration #aquarellegallery #readingaddict #watercolorpainting\n#watercolor_art  #goodvibesonly  #simplicityisbeauty #universe\n#spiritualenlightenment #naturephotograpy #lockdowndiaries #artlover🎨 #watercolorgallery\n#artsy #paintlove #artinstadaily #homelovers #bookmarkart\n#sketch_book #positivevibesonly💯","NumberOfLikes":287,"Hashtags":["#amatureart","#bookmarks","#bookloversday","#lovetoread","#quotes🖋","#wisdomtree","#lovequotes","#quoteslover","#watercolourart","#aquarelleart","#aquarelleillustration","#aquarellegallery","#readingaddict","#watercolorpainting","#watercolor_art","#goodvibesonly ","#simplicityisbeauty","#universe","#spiritualenlightenment","#naturephotograpy","#lockdowndiaries","#artlover🎨","#watercolorgallery","#artsy","#paintlove","#artinstadaily","#homelovers","#bookmarkart","#sketch_book","#positivevibesonly💯"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Anuja on August 17, 2020.","NumberOfComments":96,"Timestamp":1597682516,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 18:41:56 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"hultis_garden","CaptionText":"Unsere Birnen wachsen und wachsen. 😍 Alles eine Frage der Zeit.

I come from a big, close family - and being away from them was really difficult. \n\nI remember one time, I was walking through a shopping centre outside London, and suddenly I felt a wave of uncontrollable emotion rush over me. I stood in the middle of the walkway, and cried. It was unexpected (and let\u2019s face it, a little awkward), but I couldn\u2019t control it. I missed home.\n\nI may be at home now, but I\u2019ve felt those waves a lot lately. Because a home isn\u2019t just about the four walls and roof over our heads. A home isn\u2019t just about the scenery we take for granted every day as we go about our lives. A home isn\u2019t just about the things that make it a place to feel secure and safe. \n\nHome, for me, is about people. The people who make my little place in the world feel content, warm and comforting. Like home. \n\nMy Mum\u2019s cooking that instantly injects me with love and my Dad\u2019s ridiculous jokes that have us rolling our eyes and laughing simultaneously. That feels like home. \nMy little brothers and sisters, our dynamic and our banter\u2026 that\u2019s home.\nSeeing my beautiful friends, and drinking bubbles, talking our heads off, practicing impossible TikTok dances, and dancing on tables as we laugh all night\u2026. that\u2019s home. \nWaking up before the sun each day, jumping in the car to the gym and moving my body with people who uplift and inspire me\u2026 that\u2019s home. \nSeeing my children play with their friends, and run through our house laughing and playing with their little buddies\u2026 that\u2019s home. \nPopping across or down the road to my neighbours\u2019 house for a quick cup of tea and a chat (or a cheeky Friday champagne)\u2026 that\u2019s home. \nSeeing my nieces and nephews, and the children of my beautiful friends grow up and play with my kids... that\u2019s home. \nWalking through our village on a Sunday when the Farmer\u2019s Market is on - buying local produce and seeing cafes so busy their customers are spilling out on the streets as they happily waiting for their coffee in the sunshine\u2026. that\u2019s home. \n\n(Continued in comments)....","NumberOfLikes":63,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":40,"Timestamp":1597658938,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 12:08:58 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"nurifakier","CaptionText":"Monday morning project...\n#pantry\n#CapeTown \n#lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":10,"Hashtags":["#pantry","#CapeTown","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1597658853,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 12:07:33 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"vaishalis_official","CaptionText":"#farmlovers #horsebathing #horsesofinstagram #horselove #farmhouse #weekendvibes #lockdown2020 #lockdowndiaries ##farmanimals #bathingtime #instagood #japaloupe","NumberOfLikes":87,"Hashtags":["#farmlovers","#horsebathing","#horsesofinstagram","#horselove","#farmhouse","#weekendvibes","#lockdown2020","#lockdowndiaries","#farmanimals","#bathingtime","#instagood","#japaloupe"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1597658371,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 11:59:31 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"jetsetlifemode","CaptionText":"Time to play!\n\nIn between throwback stories of travel & food, there\u2019s one piece of good news from here.

If you were, you wouldn\u2019t have anything to strive for. You have this one life to pursue your dreams. If you get the urge to create something with your life, do it! \n\nSometimes the tougher the circumstances are in our life, the more of a catalyst those circumstances will become in pushing us to fight for our dream.\n\nWhen you find that burning desire to be or do something, you\u2019ve found a powerful force that can cut through seemingly impossible circumstances and limitations.\n\nFor me passion is purpose. It\u2019s that desire to be someone or to do something. It moves you like nothing else in life. It\u2019s something you\u2019re attracted to, something you\u2019re passionate about and it fills you with joy and sets your heart on fire when you do it.\n\nTravelling fills me with joy and ignites my passion for living to the fullest on this planet. When I am not travelling I am always researching, browsing and planning to travel. It\u2019s always on my mind and in my spirit. \n\nIstanbul is one city I have visited a couple of times and yet there is so much left to see and explore. Love the mix of classic royal ottoman culture, modern day Europeanised influences, Islamic art, the delicious Turkish cuisine and the grand charming palaces on the steps of Bosphorus river. I simply cannot wait to travel to Turkey 🇹🇷 again. \n\nOnce the world finally gets a handle on this deadly pandemic I will forever be grateful for a chance to travel again in peace. \n\n#travel #travelgram #instatravel #tourism #passportready #wanderlust #besties #forever #ilovetravel #passionpassport #suitcasetravels #traveldeeper #iamatraveller #discoveries #forbestravelguide #passion #travelislife #travelispassion #ciragan #palace #kempinski #istanbul #turkey #ottoman #empire #lockdowndiaries #postlockdowngoals #travelgoals #memories #travelmemories","NumberOfLikes":49,"Hashtags":["#travel","#travelgram","#instatravel","#tourism","#passportready","#wanderlust","#besties","#forever","#ilovetravel","#passionpassport","#suitcasetravels","#traveldeeper","#iamatraveller","#discoveries","#forbestravelguide","#passion","#travelislife","#travelispassion","#ciragan","#palace","#kempinski","#istanbul","#turkey","#ottoman","#empire","#lockdowndiaries","#postlockdowngoals","#travelgoals","#memories","#travelmemories"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by wanderlustbestiesforever🦋 in Ciragan Palace Kempinski Istanbul.

You may have to face certain aspects of life alone, but don't confuse the battles you must fight alone with being lonely or deprived of love and care. You're always going to have people that care about you around you because being a part of your life is important to them.  Just like it's important to you to be a part of the lives of those you care about. Don't forget the people that silently cheer you on without being too loud or constantly reminding you of their existence. \n\n We often forget how much people mean to us or get so used to their presence that they don't stand out to us anymore. When this happens, it can feel like you're alone. Take out a minute to list out all the people you can stop talking to\/ never see again but don't want to. Are you being appreciative of these people? Are you too used to seeing them? Do they not stand out to you anymore because they're not the same as you are? Cherish all the good that's around you. You don't have to be chasing people around, but it only takes a few minutes to appreciate the good around you or simply tell someone 'i appreciate that you're part of my life'. Reach out to the people that think about\/remember you in the little things. Or people that you remember or think about in the little things. You've never been alone because of them even if their presence only contributed to a moment in your life. In this life, especially this year, nothing is a given. There is only now.\n\n#okaybye #lockdownlife #lockdown2020 #lockdowndiaries #covid19 #goodvibes #goodvibesonly #motivation","NumberOfLikes":6,"Hashtags":["#okaybye","#lockdownlife","#lockdown2020","#lockdowndiaries","#covid19","#goodvibes","#goodvibesonly","#motivation"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Donna Peris on August 16, 2020.

Now start adding milk while swiftly whisking the batter. Ensure to add milk gradually and not at one go. Once a thick creamy consistency is formed, keep the batter aside. Now grease the baking tin with butter or refined oil. Before pouring the batter into tin, add ENO to the mix and gently mix it using cut and fold method. Make sure to not over whisk the batter post adding ENO. And now immediately pour the batter in tin.\nPut the tin in microwave and set the timer for 5 mins. Take out the tin and your nice fluffy sponge is ready. Keep the sponge to cool down.\n\nP.S. I decorated the cake since it was a friend's birthday. You can have the simply baked cake sponge with coffee or tea. It will taste awesome! \nFor layering and decoration: \nBefore layering the sponges, I have sprayed them with sugar syrup to make it little moist. While layering, I used the chocolate syrup. It helps the sponge to stick together and gives a good flavour as well. For decoration, I have randomly arrange Oreo original biscuits and chocolate pieces over condensed milk which I poured on the top most sponge. On the sides I have arranged choco waffle rolls. To make the rolls stick to the sponge, you can use the choclate syrup or Hershey's cocoa spread.\n\nNote: \n1) For a 3 tier cake like mine, I baked 3 cake sponges. \n2) No oven pre heating required.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#oreocake #lockdowndiaries #birthdaycake #homebaked #homemade #bakinglove #cakelove #cake #cakedecorating #cakesofinstagram #ig_india #igcakes #chocolatecake #hersheys #dukes #waffles #cocoa #cadburyoreo #cadbury #cakelovers #homechef #3layercake #layeredcake #yummy #microwavecake #quickcake #easycakes #cakerecipe #cakebaking #foodphotography","NumberOfLikes":13,"Hashtags":["#oreocake","#lockdowndiaries","#birthdaycake","#homebaked","#homemade","#bakinglove","#cakelove","#cake","#cakedecorating","#cakesofinstagram","#ig_india","#igcakes","#chocolatecake","#hersheys","#dukes","#waffles","#cocoa","#cadburyoreo","#cadbury","#cakelovers","#homechef","#3layercake","#layeredcake","#yummy","#microwavecake","#quickcake","#easycakes","#cakerecipe","#cakebaking","#foodphotography"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Shruti Kishore on August 16, 2020.

Mine\u2019s not nearly as tasty as my gran\u2019s, but making this dessert refreshes my memory of my happy childhood every time and that gladdens my heart.

Elegant yet simple, it is swift, light and fluffy. It embodies all the nuances of the autumn perfume - ginger, cinnamon and caramel, blurring the absence of coffee.\n.\nEmbellished with their flecks of spices and sparkles of sugar peeking through the velvety cream, the crushed cookies is flamboyantly charismatic.\n.\nUsing crushed lotus biscoff biscuits, provides a toothsome contrast to the usual boudoir lady fingers. The taste is opulent and rich yet it is not as heavy as most desserts, quietly mollifying after a plump Sunday lunch. You can either serve it from a large bowl or prepare individual servings in pretty glasses or bowls.\n.\nThe link to this recipe can be found in the profile. \n\nTo shop my ebook, head over to the link in bio.\n.\nFollow @foodiesof_cakewalk for more photos and ideas\/recipes.
