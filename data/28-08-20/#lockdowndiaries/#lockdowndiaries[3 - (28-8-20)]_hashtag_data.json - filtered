Here it goes-\n\nBeginning with Sheldon, you hated changes as much as I do but did not even remember or miss the past when you got busy with the changed life. You've my heart. You were selfish at times but that does not change my feelings for you. ❤️❤️\n\nPenny, you're a friend that everyone should have in their lives. You not just accepted them wholeheartedly but also taught Leonard and Sheldon the true meaning of love. Different forms of love. You taught me that it's okay for people around you to be selfish, you should keep loving them with all your heart. And what you said about changes- I love you, girl. ❤️❤️\n\nLeonard, you were confused & indecisive about everything but you were sure about the most important things in your life. And that matters the most. I found you very close. Just can't express why & how. 😘😘\n\nHoward- Good to find you who joked on anything and everything and even in the worst case situations. Ask me? People find us weird but we're just cool people. They can never understand us. 🤩 ❤️\n\nBernie: Loving someone weird is not easy. But you anyway decided to be with Howard & turned out a step ahead of him in terms of one liners. I shouldn't say this but you're the kind of dominance I seek in life. Almost always right or forcefully right. 😂\n\nAmy, you knew what you had in store for yourself when you decided to be with him. You showed compassion and bravery and patience and tolerance and friendship and yes, your last speech changed it all for good so, thoughtful and mending. You were the star. 🌸🌸❤️❤️\n\nAnd last Raj, it's okay to run after just one thing and still not find it. You proved that sometimes, we got to stop running after things we are not able to accomplish and cherish what we have with us. Maybe human connections and happiness and the feeling of laughing with those you love is above everything else. 🌸❤️\n\n#Recommend #lockdownkasahara #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":74,"Hashtags":["#Bigbangtheory","#Recommend","#lockdownkasahara","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":10,"Timestamp":1597498343,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 15:32:23 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"NATIVE CAKES by Mum\u2019s Delicacies. ✨ \n\nPlease swipe right for the price list! \n\nOrder today, available  tomorrow. \n\u2022Grab\n\u2022Lalamove\n\u2022Pick up\n\u2022Meet up (+ additional fee)","NumberOfLikes":1,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597497808,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 15:23:28 CEST 2020","Location":"Quezon City, Philippines"},{"CaptionText":"NATIVE CAKES by Mum\u2019s Delicacies. ✨ \n\nPlease swipe right for the price list! \n\nOrder today, available  tomorrow. \n\u2022Grab\n\u2022Lalamove\n\u2022Pick up\n\u2022Meet up (+ additional fee)","NumberOfLikes":1,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597497776,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 15:22:56 CEST 2020","Location":"Quezon City, Philippines"},{"CaptionText":"NATIVE CAKES by Mum\u2019s Delicacies. ✨ \n\nPlease swipe right for the price list! \n\nOrder today, available  tomorrow. \n\u2022Grab\n\u2022Lalamove\n\u2022Pick up\n\u2022Meet up (+ additional fee)","NumberOfLikes":1,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597497734,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 15:22:14 CEST 2020","Location":"Quezon City, Philippines"},{"CaptionText":"🙋Weekends & Evenings ❤️\n💁Inji tea & sweet corn 😁\n🙋Balcony & Chitchat 🏡\nWhat more u need🧿...\n.\n.\n.\n#withhusband #weekendgetaway #balconyscenes\n#injitea #sweetcorn #evenings #chitchat\n Follow @ranisplatter\n.\n.\n.\n#lockdowncooking #foodbloggers\n#eattherainbow🌈 #lockdowndiaries #oldschoolgirl\n#beingauthentic #balconygardening\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n #donebyme #quarantine #quarantinecooking #homecookingisthebest #wholesomefood #vegetarianrecipes #foodlover #nomnom #nyummy #eathealthybehealthy #happyeating #mondayfeels #mondaymood #chennaidays #southindianfoods  #nomnom24x7","NumberOfLikes":46,"Hashtags":["#withhusband","#weekendgetaway","#balconyscenes","#injitea","#sweetcorn","#evenings","#chitchat","#lockdowncooking","#foodbloggers","#eattherainbow🌈","#lockdowndiaries","#oldschoolgirl","#beingauthentic","#balconygardening","#donebyme","#quarantine","#quarantinecooking","#homecookingisthebest","#wholesomefood","#vegetarianrecipes","#foodlover","#nomnom","#nyummy","#eathealthybehealthy","#happyeating","#mondayfeels","#mondaymood","#chennaidays","#southindianfoods","#nomnom24x7"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":8,"Timestamp":1597497641,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 15:20:41 CEST 2020","Location":"Chennai, India"},{"CaptionText":"NATIVE CAKES by Mum\u2019s Delicacies. ✨ \n\nPlease swipe right for the price list! \n\nOrder today, available  tomorrow. \n\u2022Grab\n\u2022Lalamove\n\u2022Pick up\n\u2022Meet up (+ additional fee)","NumberOfLikes":1,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597497550,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 15:19:10 CEST 2020","Location":"Quezon City, Philippines"},{"CaptionText":"NATIVE CAKES by Mum\u2019s Delicacies. ✨ \n\nPlease swipe right for the price list! \n\nOrder today, available  tomorrow. \n\u2022Grab\n\u2022Lalamove\n\u2022Pick up\n\u2022Meet up (+ additional fee)","NumberOfLikes":1,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597497494,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 15:18:14 CEST 2020","Location":"Quezon City, Philippines"},{"CaptionText":"Even after all this time, the sun never says to the earth, \u201Cyou owe me\u201D.\nLook \nWhat happens with the Love like that\nIt lights up the whole sky.-Hafiz\n\n#hanumanasana #splits #yogapractice #yogainspiration #yogalife #yogachallenge #lockdowndiaries #fitnessjourney #fitness #peaceandlove","NumberOfLikes":55,"Hashtags":["#hanumanasana","#splits","#yogapractice","#yogainspiration","#yogalife","#yogachallenge","#lockdowndiaries","#fitnessjourney","#fitness","#peaceandlove"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by jamyang choden in Thimphu, Bhutan with @yoga_and_naturopathy.

There was no beautiful alone time that heals your mind and body, and provides you with serene revitalisation.But during lockdown, we had ample amounts of time to enjoy doing absolutely nothing. Going up on the terrace, letting the slow moisture-laiden breeze tangle up your hair, and leaving all your worries behind was perhaps my best experience.I practised mindfulness and self-introspection in this unexpected and bizarre me time. It helped me to nurture my inner-self and slowly come out of the existential crisis that young adults normally suffer from.Listening to music after a long time was rejuvenating. Talented American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift just released her album \"Folklore\", and my favorite pass time now is just vibing to the relatable lyrics and enthralling symphonies. Kahlil Gibran had said -'Music is the language of the spirit. It opens the secret of life bringing peace, abolishing strife.' \"\n\n#edtimestories #music #soulful #introspection #lockdowndiaries #taylorswift #kahlilgibran #mindfulness #wholesome","NumberOfLikes":19,"Hashtags":["#edtimestories","#music","#soulful","#introspection","#lockdowndiaries","#taylorswift","#kahlilgibran","#mindfulness","#wholesome"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by ED Times on August 15, 2020 tagging @paridhi.sehgal.

First it\u2019s my way of journaling so i will remember what this weird \u201Cforced on us\u201D time was like (although I suspect I won\u2019t forget it!😄)\nIt\u2019s also for people to learn what a lockdown does and can look like. This is no holidays, no chosen way to travel nor move into a new place, this was all decided for us and we just have to make it work. \nI\u2019m not complaining, this is not hard, this is not ideal and has its challenges but we are all well and so far healthy. We are learning how to live together in a confine space with no outing whatsoever, no fresh air, little choice on what happens during the day, after months of living confined. This is not a time to compare and think of all the things that could be different. For me, it\u2019s time to keep focusing on what an amazing adventure it is for our family, all the greatness that is to come and share some fun time with those i love the most 👦🏼👦🏼👧🏼👱🏻\u200D♂️💞\nSo on the early morning of our 4th day, I\u2019m enjoying looking back at the photos of what made our 3rd day in lockdown amazing!\n\nFirst on the list, but not least, we managed to order 2 coffees and 3 babyccinos 🎉💞😋🎉 this was such a treat especially as we know we won\u2019t be able to enjoy this for the next 2-3 days. \nThen i connected my phone back so we can now call all our family and friends all over 👍. We therefor had lovely chats with a few of our favourite people 🥰\nWe also got to enjoy watching the rather wet and cloudy day unfold in front of our eyes. Clouds are fascinating and will make fun art projects over the next couple of weeks. \nOur amazing sister and brother in law dropped off a bag with pens\/pencils\/paper and a uno game (well there are a few more gems that will come out over the next few days) so we had lots of fun playing uno together. \nLastly we all attempted exercising for a bit. That wasn\u2019t successful but we are working on finding a routine in here and it\u2019s a first step the right way!\nAfter an almost normal night sleep, I can\u2019t wait for what this beautiful sunny Saturday has to offer 🥰😍\n\n#lockdowndiaries #expatlife #itsallgood #mybabiesaremyworld @glowwiththe.flo","NumberOfLikes":11,"Hashtags":["#lockdowndiaries","#expatlife","#itsallgood","#mybabiesaremyworld"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Flo on August 14, 2020.

I love films that are about folks testing themselves, following a dream, doing something that peels away the layers of \u2018the self\u2019 you think you know.\nThis quote resonated with me deeply and really got me thinking.\n\n\u2019How important is it in life not necessarily to be strong but to feel strong, to measure yourself at least once, to find yourself at least once in the most ancient of human conditions, facing the blind, deaf stone alone, with nothing to help you but your own hands and your own head....\u2019\n\nWhen I first heard these words I immediately thought of birth. How by just looking at me at certain points in my labour you may have thought I was weakening, that I was losing my will or ability to birth my baby.  What you wouldn\u2019t have seen (and sometimes it was also lost to myself) was the deep, embedded connection and trust I held in birth and in my intuition.  So although my strength and trust was felt deep in my bones, it was not always shown outwardly or felt consciously by me ...and that was ok... because it lead me to face a challenge that would take no prisoners!! There was no way through it other than through it, no way but to trust that deep knowing that birth belongs to women, that unless my intuition told me something was deeply wrong, I was the only one that could see me through, with my \u2018own hands and my own head\u2019! \nIt reminded me of this awesome quote by Yolande Norris-Clarke of @freebirthsociety \u2018Birth will decimate you, and that\u2019s one of its gifts\u2019!\nThe gift being the knowledge that you are stronger than you have the capacity to understand. \n\nThe quote from \u2018Into The Wild\u2019 obviously wasn\u2019t written about birth as it was written by a man! I would imagine that for him it was about adversity and coming through it via expression and release and trust and determination.\nThese are very testing times we are living through at the moment and sometimes I don\u2019t feel strong at all.  But I keep putting one foot in front of the other as that\u2019s all we can do.  So please know, even if you aren\u2019t feeling strong, YOU ARE, because you are still here.

I have been writing and rewriting the review since then. I couldn't find the right words to express how much I loved this book. I still can't. But not posting about this book seems unfair. \n\nThis is the story of a black man charged with the rape of a white girl. This is the story of the best dad - Atticus Finch. This is the story of three little gems - Scout, Jem and Dill.\n\nWhat I liked best is that the story is narrated through the innocent eyes of a little girl called Scout. It shows us that a 9-year-old kid can understand that judging a person by his colour is not fair. However, adults find it very hard to treat people in a fair manner. At times they don't even realise what they are doing is wrong. \n\nThis book was written in 1960, but it has still not lost its relevance. The recent murder of George Floyd reminds us that we haven't learnt much despite addressing the issue for several decades. \n\nI bought this book a few years back. I couldn't get past the first few pages all those years.

Why are we always crawling over the finish line when it comes to a holiday? We all need to get better at giving ourselves a rest. Practice is the only way.\n\nWe are off down to Norfolk, which I booked when lockdown first started easing and now I can't quite believe it's actually happening. \n\nWe've managed the last few months in a house with barely any outside space and at last we will have a garden for five glorious nights. Looks like it's going to chuck it down, but I'm fully prepared to drink wine on a patio in a thunderstorm.\n\nI've finished working with four of my six Mighty Messaging 1:1 clients now and it has been such an incredible treat, I have no words. I always feel a bit sheepish sharing feedback, but I'm going to have to do it this time, seeing as I've been telling everyone else to, and also because it has made me beam (will pop a few bits in Stories).\n\nI'm going to open the programme up again in September at a slightly higher price, but if you want to reserve a spot early you can book this month for the old price and grab a bargain, just DM me for more info. The programme is 3 weeks long and is designed to get you moving with your online presence and messaging (web, social, emails, blogs) in a more focused way. If you're looking to get back out there with your business in September, it could be just the boost you need ⚡\n\nI'm also elbow-deep in planning my next workshop, which is going to be all about understanding and writing for your audience in an intuitive way. Move over ideal customer exercises (Jenny aged 43 drinks earl grey and shops at Waitrose) this is going to go really deep into customer values, beliefs and behaviours until they become walking, talking, real beings you can write for with ease.\n\nSo excited about this one - I'll be back with more info after the break! Jump!\n\nHave a great week next week everyone, I'll be bombarding you with holiday spam in Stories no doubt ☂️🌩🍦❤","NumberOfLikes":64,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Penny Brazier ~ copywriter on August 14, 2020.

Four people in my family including myself got infected with the Coronavirus at different times in the past 5 months, all successfully recovered now. The virus debilitated my body and left me with a kind of fatigue I was not prepared for. Dancing was a far-fetched goal, it was a task to get basic chores done without feeling breathless. As dancers, we are not used to feeling weak in the body and we are always trying to increase our stamina, strength and longevity. The exhaustion that follows a good practise session gives us deep satisfaction and we not only express through our body, we also \u2018think and feel\u2019 from it. Hungry to dance again but sensing my body is not strong enough to support the flights my mind was taking was heartbreaking to say the least. On 1st August, I finally pushed myself to record a dance video for a project I was part of. I was very scared that I would be able to dance for long hours for it. But I did it. Even though it took more effort to dance than before, looking at myself in the mirror in full costume and makeup reminded me again of my identity as a dancer. It taught me that in life my body will continue to go through ups and downs; but my dance will always live within me, and my body will always be my instrument to express and share my art with the world.\n\n@siddhigoelkathak is a Kathak dancer and teacher based in New Delhi.

Being under these lockdown restrictions is a strange experience. It takes an emotional toll. Some days I feel fine, others I feel irrationally emotional. I think it\u2019s the constant low-level stress of knowing we are living under restrictions, even if they\u2019re not directly affecting what we want to do on a given day. \n\nMore and more I see our home as a domestic monastery. This is always the case to some extent, but living through this lockdown I feel a particular affinity with cloistered religious. I\u2019ve begun to understand more intimately what a huge decision they make in choosing to give up their interactions with the outside world. And I\u2019ve been inspired by the concept of a monastic rule to refine the structure of our own days. \n\nThe restrictions on our movements have forced me to re-examine the basics of our home life. God can make any situation work for our good. The greatest fruit of this time has been my determination to become an early riser. For years I have stayed up late to fit in all the creative projects I love to do, then slept in as late as I could get away with. I\u2019d get up begrudgingly every day, forced out of bed by a young child. I was pretty unpleasant to be around, I would be greeted by an already-messy kitchen, and spend the whole day on the back foot. For over a month now I\u2019ve been up between 5.30 and 6.00am and it\u2019s made a world of difference. I am relishing the quiet, dark, CLEAN house that greets me. I can say my morning prayers and drink my coffee, uninterrupted, by candle light. When the children get up I\u2019m glad to see them. The whole day runs more smoothly. \n\nAnd this little morning discipline has begun to flow into the remainder of the day. Our family is coming together for set regular meal times and prayer times. We have our outdoor time, chore times and quiet time. None of this comes particularly naturally to me. I\u2019m not a Type A personality.

It is the suffering of being unable to love. With the lockdown taking place across the places, I thought finally i had some time to be myself. But Very Soon I realised that I can't be alone entirely and I needed someone to lean on. I needed to love someone. My so called maturity managed to save my relationship but yet I felt like I am alone. I am alone to tell myself what do i want with my life? I had time and I pondered about my soul mate, I pondered about love and lust, about the bodily needs and the emotional nutrition. For the first time, I watched the vedio's of Osho. I followed memes and the paid sex profiles. It was all so amusing the way  world was moving out there. I gathered strength to express myself and started talking to people I never knew. And it was so relief when I found some genuine people with whome I could just talk and express myself. I started coming out of Dostoyevsky's hell. I found love in my anonymity, in my expressions and in the people I started talking. \nIt was a tough time (even now and perhaps always) and I want to take a second to say thank you to all of you who talked to me, tried to understand me and stayed around. Yes, it was enough in the the amount in which you were there.

'The Guest List' by Lucy Foley. Oh it's quite intriguing!! I am already a 100 pages down in just 2 hours. Can't wait to finish it. My weekend is definitely Booked!! 😍😍\n.\n.\nThe book is a good mystery but i could pretty much predict the killer once i reached halfway through the book. I loved the way it was written. A unique way of narrative. However I felt the characters were robbed off their chance of revenge and poor Hannah had no closure. Only thing that stuck out was how did Will not figure out that Jules and Olivia were related when Olivia had clearly taken him to Jules apartment during their short period of whatever relation they had. Well!! Guess you will have to read it to find out. \nIt is worth all the time you invest in reading it.

From the person who used to stay out 14hrs a day on average to the person who haven\u2019t even seen the roads for a month or two straight, not even to get groceries was an interesting turn of events. But I must say I am loving this now. I see a number of people putting out posts on social media about how they hate staying at home and not being able to meet their loved ones, and all fidgety to go back to that NORMAL life we had. I miss my other family consisting two people; girls with whom at least meeting every other fortnight was as necessity as breathing but it\u2019s been almost half a year that I have seen their faces and nothing feels miserable compared to that. I am a barista who hasn\u2019t had a sip of coffee since I volunteered to be on unpaid leave. And what is a barista without coffee eh? I was in a relationship where I felt drained even if it was just for few number of months and I ended up calling it off. I was so afraid to talk about it that deep inside I wished him to vanish rather than confrontation. Because I am never the bearer of bad news but the receiver. I was always at the other end of spectrum. I have cut off ties with people to whom my absence doesn\u2019t mean anything. I have limited my arena to such extent where now I only communicate with people who cares about my wellbeing. Was it that easy? Oh hell no! There were times where I was just gone  because nothing I said to them made me feel understood. I like to steer the wheel of my life hence, I distanced myself from people I love so that I can reach to my own conclusions. My friends always disliked that part of me, but they understood me too. At one point, finally this pandemic crawled under my skin and made me go insane. \n\n#tobecontinued #journaling #writing #writersofinstagram #booklover #tumblr #explore #pandemic #lockdowndiaries #novice #writerslife #thoughtsbecomethings","NumberOfLikes":2,"Hashtags":["#tobecontinued","#journaling","#writing","#writersofinstagram","#booklover","#tumblr","#explore","#pandemic","#lockdowndiaries","#novice","#writerslife","#thoughtsbecomethings"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Oona 🍁 on August 13, 2020.

Place a griddle pan over a medium-high heat. When hot, place the courgette slices in the pan and cook for about 4 minutes or until they show some char lines on the courgettes. Flip the slices over and cook until the other side has charred as well. Season and set aside on a warm plate. \u2060\n4. Drizzle a little oil into the pan ⚠️ Be careful as it will still be quite hot ⚠️ Throw in the smoked garlic and the green beans, sprinkle over the paprika powder and cook on a medium heat for about 4-5 mins until cooked. They should still have a slight bite to them.\u2060\n5. Off the heat, throw the courgettes back into the pan and toss together with the green beans. Divide between the two plates and top with dollops of ricotta, toasted walnuts, drizzle over some oil & finally top with that clean and bold flavoured micro coriander.

Learning basic survival skills is yet another lesson this lock down has taught all of us. Ruchi, my wife, like many of us has turned into a family hair dresser in this lockdown. I must admit it\u2019s not the easiest of the skill to learn and now I have more respect for all the hair dressers who have so long cut my hair same on both right and left side of my face. I promise I will be less demanding when I finally go back to the shops 😄\nRuchi is very proud of her newly acquired skill and I really wanted to document this part of our lives on my canvas.

For some, these have been extremely challenging times while for many it has been time for self reflection, pausing for while and simply looking around and appreciate life and learning new skills.\nSeparation and reflection is what Covid-19 gave us. \n\nIf any of you, my friends and art lovers have a memory of this lockdown, a bitter sweet one, or just a happy one, that you would like me to paint, please feel free to contact me.

And today, ALL OF THE FEELS, as we head into lockdown 2.0. ⠀\n⠀\nYour feelings and emotions are 100% valid and okay. Please feel them, feel them and release them. Sit with them and allow yourself to move through them. ⠀\n⠀\nI wondered how I could offer some support and so I wanted to share a few things to consider to support yourself through this time:⠀\n⠀\n✨ One of my favourite mantras \u201CThis too shall pass\u201D is a wonderful way to give yourself permission to fully feel the feelings and know they are not permanent. ⠀\n⠀\n✨ Meditation 🧘\u200D♀️ a wonderful way to drop out of your head and into your body, into your heart and intuition. ⠀\n⠀\n✨ Journaling - I\u2019m a huge fan of journaling for so many different reasons! It\u2019s a great way to \u2018get stuff out\u2019, to help you release the feeling and process them. It\u2019s also a lovely way for your loving intuition to come through towards the end of the journal session with some loving words of wisdom and compassion. ⠀\n⠀\n✨ Be gentle with yourself. You\u2019re human, you\u2019re here having a human experience on earth. ⠀\n⠀\n✨ Reach out for support. Reach out to loved ones, friends, colleagues, coaches, healers and ask for what you need. ⠀\n⠀\nAnd lastly, please know that I am ALWAYS here for you. I know it can be a bit strange of social media and we forget there\u2019s real humans behind these squares, but please hear me when I say, I see you, I am here for you, I love you 💖","NumberOfLikes":36,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by EVIE ~ Life & Confidence Coach in Auckland, New Zealand.

Here I was putting together a simple veg lunch on Monday, when I got message from a friend saying she was getting us some food. And 10 mins later, she dropped off some Sorpotel and Sannas. So I had to quickly relook at our lunch options 😊Ditched the Pulao I was to make and quickly got the dough together for Tandalachi Bhakri. And paired that with the Aloo Palak, I had just finished making. Sorpotel and Sannas are an unbeatable combination -  was absolutely divine. (Our first pork dish in this \u2018lockdown season\u2019.)

Most of all, you taught me to never give up even if everything was falling apart. 25, I loved you and hated you equally. I loved you for how you stood by me even when the whole world was telling me to move onto another dream. I hated you because you made me question everything, you made me reach a point where certain aspects of life stopped making sense, more than usual. \u2028You made me understand the value of all the things I took for granted, you showed me the mirror and yanked me back into my place. You told me that the most important battle in life is not with something external but rather the one that is happening within. You taught me that at the end of the day, one might be surrounded by millions of people and yet truly only have themselves. From seeing one dream come into fruition to another flashing in red, oh how you have kept up the trend of making it a tale of two extremes.\nI laughed and I cried, and I tried to have my head held high. Quarter of my life has passed, and while most people around me have moved onto another phase of their life, I feel like mine has just begun. \n\nGoodbye 25, like all the previous years, you have been a lesson and a blessing.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n#BabbleNinja #candidphoto  #shotoniphone #malta #lovemalta #mobiography #shotoniphone11pro #iphoneography #iphonephotography #lockdownlife #lockdowndiaries #ootdbloggers #malta🇲🇹 #parisianvibes #lockdownsessions #lockdowndays #balconylife #quarantinemood #fbloggerstyle #parisianstyle #quarantinestyle #bloggercommunity #bloggerstyle #malta #maltagram #valletta #lovemalta #igersmalta","NumberOfLikes":40,"Hashtags":["#BabblingInto26","#BabbleNinja","#candidphoto","#shotoniphone","#malta","#lovemalta","#mobiography","#shotoniphone11pro","#iphoneography","#iphonephotography","#lockdownlife","#lockdowndiaries","#ootdbloggers","#malta🇲🇹","#parisianvibes","#lockdownsessions","#lockdowndays","#balconylife","#quarantinemood","#fbloggerstyle","#parisianstyle","#quarantinestyle","#bloggercommunity","#bloggerstyle","#malta","#maltagram","#valletta","#lovemalta","#igersmalta"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Rhea Nilanjana in Paris, France with @zara, and @delicatawinery.
