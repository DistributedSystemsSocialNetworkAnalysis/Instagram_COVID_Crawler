All variable, voluminous, and velocitous data have nothing to offer, unless you have the question you want them to answer.

Forex is definitely associated with a scam\/cash-loss label, however if you truly understand the markets, practice discipline and follow a tight risk management plan it is a legitimate way to earn extra money. The course is AMAZING, I\u2019ll do a proper review soon. What I love about forex is its flexibility - there are sooooo many different trading styles. When I head back to placement in a few weeks I\u2019ll be focusing on long-term trades which won\u2019t require daily effort. Please note, this is not a get rich quick affair! After completing the course I\u2019ve spent 3 months on a DEMO account, perfecting my strategies and discipline (emotional trading is a real thing 😭). I\u2019ll be starting my live account soon so will keep you guys updated ✌🏾\n⠀\n⠀\n𝙁𝙇𝙄𝙋𝙋𝙄𝙉𝙂 𝙋𝙍𝙊𝘿𝙐𝘾𝙏𝙎\n@gordontorks put me onto this a few weeks ago and I\u2019m eternally grateful 🙏🏾 It essentially involves sourcing high demand products from retailers at a bargain price and flipping them on eBay. I started this exactly 2 weeks ago with my boyfriend and we have made over £2.5k so far (revenue NOT profit). I love this because it\u2019s risk-free, if you don\u2019t sell a product you can just return it! Again, this requires effort (LOTS of driving around to source products, wrapping & shipping products, managing eBay listings etc) however it can be very lucrative if you\u2019re willing to put in the work 💪🏾✨\n⠀","NumberOfLikes":59,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":12,"Timestamp":1596994252,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 09 19:30:52 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":36,"Hashtags":["#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":10,"Timestamp":1596994232,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 09 19:30:32 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"The greatest journey is the journey within and what better way to explore the journey with books 📚 \n#bookloversday #lockdowndiaries #newadditionbookcollection","NumberOfLikes":16,"Hashtags":["#bookloversday","#lockdowndiaries","#newadditionbookcollection"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1596993729,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 09 19:22:09 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#personalspaceinvader #personalspaceplease #personalspaceisoverrated #nosuchthingaspersonalspace #trustinyourself #nopersonalspace #dogmumlife #mumlifeuk #mumlife #realmumlife #lockdownlife🔐 #lockdowndiaries #lockdownmum #lockdownproblems #dogmum #lockdownmama  #instamums #mumsofinstagramuk #ukmummy #ukmumsquad #ukmumstogether #scottishmummy #scottishmum #scottishmums #mumsinsupport #mumsunited #anxiousmummy #selfcaremama #motherhoodthroughinstagram #motherhoodunfiltered","NumberOfLikes":56,"Hashtags":["#personalspaceinvader","#personalspaceplease","#personalspaceisoverrated","#nosuchthingaspersonalspace","#trustinyourself","#nopersonalspace","#dogmumlife","#mumlifeuk","#mumlife","#realmumlife","#lockdownlife🔐","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdownmum","#lockdownproblems","#dogmum","#lockdownmama","#instamums","#mumsofinstagramuk","#ukmummy","#ukmumsquad","#ukmumstogether","#scottishmummy","#scottishmum","#scottishmums","#mumsinsupport","#mumsunited","#anxiousmummy","#selfcaremama","#motherhoodthroughinstagram","#motherhoodunfiltered"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Mummy Matters in Glasgow, United Kingdom.

I'll probably start working on the panel lines once my fingers are no longer aching and then I'll do some touch up paints for the missing color details. The color separation is good though, the off white and black really blends well with the dark green and light green as well as the grey for the Panzer CAS.

Designers for the theatrical arts have it harder because their craft really does require an actual theatre. As a lighting designer, I have not worked since the beginning of March, and as with many of my other colleagues in the professional, I do not anticipate resuming work until the next year at the earliest. It has been incredibly tough, financially, and I anticipate many of us will have to drop out of the industry altogether. Some lighting designers are using this time to train in software skills that require focus and patience, as a way to upgrade their technical repertoire. I have not been able to do that because the lockdown has meant that just staying on top of family and household caretaking consumes most of my time and energy. So this pandemic has been a crisis, and I imagine the live performing arts landscape will be utterly changed by it, whenever it does manage to resume business.\n\nDeepa studied lighting design at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, while pursuing a BFA in Dance. In the US, artists whose work she has lit include José Limón, Trisha Brown, George Balanchine, Shapiro & Smith, Sardono W. Kusumo, Gregory Maqoma, Nathan Trice and Preeti Vasudevan. In India she has designed lights for Sonal Mansingh, Dadi Padamjee, Lilette Dubey, Rama Vaidyanathan, Geeta Chandran, Pratibha Prahlad, Gilles Chuyen, Daksha Sheth, Moya Michaels, Nikhil Mehta and Sanjukta Wagh. She shares some of the recent productions that she has worked on: Unexpected Man by @padma_damodaran (2018), Vivartana by @ramavaidyanathan (2017), Rihla by @@neelchaudhuri (2019).

The same way even we took precautions but how did it entered our body is a question for us too! \n\nIt was a fine morning until I realised that it wasn't fine, I saw my mom lying there, with her body temperature elevated and severe cough. It was that moment I realised that I am doomed.\n\nFirstly, we all were under the impression that it could be normal cold but at the back of the mind we were very very scared.\n\nSince considering it as a viral we started normal treatment but that was something I still regret because her condition was deteriorating like my mark's.\n\nOther day we consulted a doctor who asked us for her X-RAY. \n\nThen seeing the X-ray, doctor said she is positive for the virus  but get her CT for confirmation. I was like anything but corona.\n\nMy dad took her  for CT scan and after seeing the report it was one more step towards the grave. We all were shocked hearing about her reports.\n\nAnd then, we took the decision to shift her to a hospital . She was  in ICU for almost 5 days and when she was tested for corona , yet the results were the same. The day she was admitted, she was kept in covid ward under observation. And she started to feel better and there was recovery and that moment I realised that God does exist.

Maybe its the extreme case of cabin fever thats got my old #explorationbugs on hyper. But we're all feeling it. And I was asking hubby why he thinks my urges to travel &explore are on overdrive right now when I logically know its not possible, when he articulated it so clearly: \"We're all looking for some sort of soul food right. And that is one of your greatest sources of joy\"\n.\nWith all thats been going on in the world, a vacuum has formed, and we naturally know to its the small things, different for 3ach of us, to feed our soul.Something that deeply feeds our spark for life, soemthing that fires us up and makes us feel alive...so that not only can we better traverse the stormy waters we constantly find ourselves in right now, but to pump back our light and good energy into this world. \n\"Because what the world needs is more people who have come alive\" \u2013 Howard Thurman.\n.\nAnd I'll  tell ya, swimming in the ocean, face to face with a bunch of #GreatWhiteSharks really does make you feel VERY MUCH ALIVE!I love exploring this world, including our local wares, because, dannng, our country is STUNNING! It's one of the things that light my fires. And definitely one I'm sorely missing. So for now I turn to other outlets, and other fires that dwell within me...waiting patiently for a time we can do more again. (Swipe to see one of these beauties we swam with)\n.\nSo what fires you up? What stirs and fills your soul? May we all have a fulfilling weekend ahead❤\n.\nPs.

It is the belief that each of us is more likely to experience good outcomes and less likely to experience bad outcomes.\nThe key to optimism bias is that we disregard the reality of an overall situation, because we think we are excluded from the potential negative effects.\nIt's just a psychological trap, nothing else.\n:\nRemember a quote from Joseph Stalin, \nA million deaths is a statistic, But one death is a tragedy.\n:\nIt's like if we read the news that 10,000 people died, it doesn't affect us that way, as a single death of someone we know, does. Because when it's a single death, we get to attach the name, story and narrative of that person and feel emotional about it, but a million deaths is indifferent to our psyche.

In contrast, the English language has 11 color words. Researchers hypothesized that the number of color terms could limit the ways that the Dani people conceptualized color.

It was a dream of mine to work in an action movie and it all started one evening on the Venduruthy Bridge in Cochin. Myself, Mithun and Rohit were brainstorming on the next project after Adam\u2019s Awakening. We threw a lot of ideas at each other out, most of which went into the water flowing beneath us but that night an exciting idea was born - 'to make a Malayalam action short film' - the name that we now know as Ghatakan. Through Ghatakan what I got to learn and explore was the action choreography and with another deep action fan, Thaha, this was a dream come true. It was a challenge for us, I must say, because none of the actors, including us, were trained in any stunt forms and suffice to say we were clueless. There was a lot of trial and error involved and with some practice, we came up with three action scenes, which I feel is the base of the film. The film basically cruises through the action scenes and the story, let's just say, takes a backseat. It was our first attempt and we were kind of satisfied with what we could pull of, considering the resources, time and money we had but one thing's for sure - we are going to start our own action choreography unit sometime soon!!! Alle @Thaha kolpad Ji??\n\nThe other thing I want to mention here before it gets into the boring territory is the music composed by Rohit and his team. It's simply contributes so much to the theme of Ghatakan.\n\nGhatakan is not your usual short film. It has its own simplicities and complexities. \nThis was an out and out experiment. we put our best efforts to make it what it turned out to be. It's been 5 years since the inception of this project. This video is the whole film and the memories associated with it under 5 minutes(My attempt to edit) .  Cheers to more  action films and probably a sequel.. what say @mithunsundaresh @rohtang_unlimited @benzone86 @arunmena @achutang @ thahaji... 😀\n#throwbackthursday #ghatakanthefilm #actionfilms #lockdowndiaries #experimentalfilm","NumberOfLikes":16,"Hashtags":["#throwbackthursday","#ghatakanthefilm","#actionfilms","#lockdowndiaries","#experimentalfilm"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1596724313,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 06 16:31:53 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Siya Baby\n@naphade_r.v \n.\n.\n#siya #sketch #portrait #babbling #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":40,"Hashtags":["#siya","#sketch","#portrait","#babbling","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Priti Naphade on August 06, 2020.

Social distancing and quarantine are the norm of the day. But in dealing with the pandemic are we ignoring another pandemic that is slowly creeping it's way up in our society? \nYes your stress and panic is contagious as well. 😫😫😫😫😫\nIn the absence of a vaccine, social distancing and quarantine are the only way we have to flatten the corona curve. However they have their own problems. After all we are social animals so the quarantine and social distancing is giving rise to mental health concerns such as anxiety, anger, sleep disturbances,  depression and PTSD. \nAdditionally they are grappling with infection, boredom, frustration, inadequate food and financial losses. Medicos are focussing on physical health but we need to consider our mental health as well\nSo how do we put a stop to all this A few basic steps:-\n1) STOP judging those who have travelled abroad. They are already stressed. \n2) Keep yourself well hydrated and take a diet rich in protein. \n3) Exercise daily💪💪💪. There is no better stress buster. Downtown and use some online fitness apps. \n4) Limit your intake of caffeine and alcohol. \n5) Focus on the positives. Stay updated but avoid negative news reports. \n6) Stay connected with your loved ones.","NumberOfLikes":6,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Vinod in Chennai, India.

After distributing the gifts, she asked, 'Mummy! When can we do this again?' Ever since, we celebrate festivals at the orphanage\u2013you can\u2019t put a price to their smiles. \nSo one day, during the lockdown, I saw a sweeper limping, yet doing his duty. I immediately gave him food, a mask & a sanitizer. His eyes lit up & he said, 'Thank you!' They were just 2 words, but I felt his gratitude & realised how little our essential workers have. \nSo I ordered sanitization kits & collaborated with a kitchen service to distribute them amongst essential workers, police & sweepers. My husband was worried about my safety, but I followed protocol. \nA week later, my son Shrey said, 'Ma, wait! I'm coming with you\u2019, & Meghna joined too. We went from Juhu to Marine Drive, distributing essentials amongst 400 workers.\nWe've been doing this for 2 months every weekend & the response has been heartwarming. A cop even asked Meghna for a selfie to show his kid! We even give free health check-ups to the elderly in our society. \nIt began last month, when my father-in-law had a low sugar episode. That\u2019s when Meghna said, 'Shouldn't we do something for the senior citizens too?' She\u2019s a doctor, so she attends to the elderly, while I arrange for their food & medicines. They live alone & they're scared\u2013we\u2019re just trying to make them feel less alone. \nLike one of the aunties had breast pain & feared it was cancer, until my daughter did a physical examination & calmed her down. \nBut that day when Meghna came home, I couldn\u2019t help but hug her. I'm so proud of the woman she's become. And Shrey too\u2013he's just 14, but he used all his birthday funds to buy essentials for 150 workers.\nWhen I began trying to make a difference 15 years ago, I barely had the resources. But now, with our NGO Meghashrey, we can do much more. \nI\u2019ve realised that if you really want to help, it takes one step. I started with funding my driver\u2019s son\u2019s education\u2013today he\u2019s a CA looking after his family. So that\u2019s what it\u2019s about\u2013taking that one step to help & you never know how that one step could change a person\u2019s life forever.\u201D","NumberOfLikes":35289,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":142,"Timestamp":1596630205,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 05 14:23:25 CEST 2020","Location":"Mumbai, Maharashtra"},{"CaptionText":"#Scenery #copied\n#natureartgallery\n#natureartwork \n#seashores\n#brustroa5notebook\n#brustropencilarts \n#involutedesign \n#artwork \n#lockdownart \n#quarantinelife \n#lockdowndiaries \n#artzoneforu #igdaily #igartwork #igart  #artoftheday #indianpromotionhouse","NumberOfLikes":24,"Hashtags":["#Scenery","#copied","#natureartgallery","#natureartwork","#seashores","#brustroa5notebook","#brustropencilarts","#involutedesign","#artwork","#lockdownart","#quarantinelife","#lockdowndiaries","#artzoneforu","#igdaily","#igartwork","#igart","#artoftheday","#indianpromotionhouse"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by vidu_artzone in Chitrakoot : A Cultural Heritage with @_artist_booth, @bindass_art, @brustro_official, @_._artistica_._, @art_revelations_india, @art.sharing101, and @artistcommunityindia.
