I felt like I was in my very own scene from The Lake House chasing light and having no idea how to capture it. Mostly I affirmed my love of all things door especially hinges, door knockers and letter boxes; my love of a playlist I can sing along to, of wandering around and letting dusk spread over me, of driving under a summer sky with the windows down, of dreaming and hoping and praying unrealistically and then walking peacefully with my heart chattering in step with all of that.

The pre-recorded interviews take place via Zoom and are posted every Tuesday afternoon. You can find them all on the Different Strokes website, Facebook page and YouTube channel but a snippet of each already on the DS channels have also been posted to our feed to briefly introduce our wonderful Instagram audience and to give everyone a taster of personal affiliation with each survivor.\n\nLockdown interview number eight features stroke survivors Sheelagh and Carole. Sheelagh is our Family Administrator at Different Strokes. She had her stroke in 2018 at the age of 51. Carole has had 2 strokes; one in 2014 and lamentably, another in 2019 as she was celebrating her 5 year mark. Usually, clips are 1 minute long, but the infectious & inspiring energy radiating from Carole was too important to cut down. Today\u2019s is a 10 minute long IGTV for you to absorb. \n\nNot only did Carole speak to Sheelagh about lockdown - her trike lessons and travel plans that got cut short; being tethered to the house with little exercise; cognitive challenges with shopping and text messages and the worry and discomfort of managing with this new, unfamiliar, confusing space - she also talked about her own stroke journey; how her stroke brain and loss of memory has shaped her and taught her values; how discovering the term Neurofatigue changed her way of thinking and is key to navigating and planning her day; her personal experiences with getting to know her stroke brain, how she processes behaviours and emotions, what she\u2019s struggled with and her ongoing physical battle. With that, came a motivational and light-hearted pep talk with some incredibly encouraging words that I think we all need to hear.\n\n Catch the full interview at:\nüîó https:\/\/differentstrokes.co.uk\/stroke-survivor-experiences-during-lockdown\/\n‚ñ∂Ô∏è https:\/\/youtu.be\/nNBMW414umk\nüëçüèº https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/differentstrokescharity\/\n\nNeurofatigue link: \nhttps:\/\/bit.ly\/2BV06WN","NumberOfLikes":18,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1596540571,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 04 13:29:31 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"theadventuresofravenhair","CaptionText":"Throwback to that time when the sea came in fifty shades of turquoise. #maenam #belmond #belmondpostcards #belmondnapasai #kohsamui #kohsamuithailand #thailandtravel #samui #beach #beachlife #lifestyle #lifestyleguide #luxurytravel #luxuryblog #luxurylifestyle #workandplay #thefreewheelingproject #cnntraveler #natgeotravelpic #nature #beachlife #iwashere #luxurylife #luxuryhotel #hotelsuite #thegoodlife #turquoise #water #sailing #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":24,"Hashtags":["#maenam","#belmond","#belmondpostcards","#belmondnapasai","#kohsamui","#kohsamuithailand","#thailandtravel","#samui","#beach","#beachlife","#lifestyle","#lifestyleguide","#luxurytravel","#luxuryblog","#luxurylifestyle","#workandplay","#thefreewheelingproject","#cnntraveler","#natgeotravelpic","#nature","#beachlife","#iwashere","#luxurylife","#luxuryhotel","#hotelsuite","#thegoodlife","#turquoise","#water","#sailing","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1596540568,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 04 13:29:28 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"artsy_community","CaptionText":"Double tap if you want these beautiful table coasters to win The Creativity Contest 1.0 at Artcom !\n\nReposted from @varshitasaha Table coaster \n\n#tablecoaster #tablecoasterset #repost #handicrafts #handmade #naturalthreads #natural #juterope #naturaljuterope #lockdown2020 #lockdown #lockdowndiaries #accrelic #accreliccolor #accrelicpaint #white #whitecolor #use1color #creativity #creative #artistic #creativeproductdesigner #creativeproductdesign #product #productdesign #productdesigner #independentartist #independentwork  #lovetodesignhomes #lovetodesign‚ù§","NumberOfLikes":49,"Hashtags":["#tablecoaster","#tablecoasterset","#repost","#handicrafts","#handmade","#naturalthreads","#natural","#juterope","#naturaljuterope","#lockdown2020","#lockdown","#lockdowndiaries","#accrelic","#accreliccolor","#accrelicpaint","#white","#whitecolor","#use1color","#creativity","#creative","#artistic","#creativeproductdesigner","#creativeproductdesign","#product","#productdesign","#productdesigner","#independentartist","#independentwork","#lovetodesignhomes","#lovetodesign‚ù§"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Artcom on August 04, 2020.","NumberOfComments":8,"Timestamp":1596540454,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 04 13:27:34 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"jamescvickers","CaptionText":"See I don\u2019t always have an alcoholic drink in my hand I promise","NumberOfLikes":157,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Jam on August 04, 2020 tagging @asos, @asos_man, and @churchfarm_anslow.

Yesterday, we received the sad news that the @architecthusband\u2019s aunt Rose passed away so suddenly. It pains me just by typing this. Losing a loved one is difficult as it is, what more during a pandemic?\n\nHow do you console people grieving when you can\u2019t be with them in person? Is it OK to still post happy photos? Would it be insensitive to get on with our lives knowing that a huge part of someone dear to us has lost its spark?\n\nRelatives may be socially distant now, but the current situation has brought loved ones (and even strangers) closer. Everything is just a message away. Everything is just a thumbs up or heart away. We have no excuse not to be able to reach out because technology is so advanced, we can talk to someone and see someone eye to eye, with just a click of a button.\n\nAnd a click of a button I find myself doing more lately, especially when it\u2019s something about JS and #BigBoyJesse. I am not good in photography but I love collecting memories we can look back to: when we eat\/ bake\/ play\/ be silly together. Rather mundane, really, but it\u2019s worth living for every second of the day.\n\nBecause life is fickle. And we don\u2019t know when it will be taken away from us. So, go ahead and be silly. You earned that.\n\nTito Bobby, @winnie_selga , Winchell, Wilbert, Isaiah, and the whole Selga clan, our hearts are with you. Take care, always.\n\nPS: Our aunt @dalisayirasusta sent us a care package from the US (THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!) which we unboxed last Sunday and JS was so excited to try on his new Beatles shirt.

Was previously using a tiny, made-in-Delhi one which arrived with 2 out of 4 knobs detached and multiple screws loose. Nevertheless, it served me well and was well worth the \u20B92K I spent on it (plus the \u20B95 Fevi-kwik for it to not fall apart).\n\nBut this new one is a beast. Settled on it after visiting virtually every store in Bangalore, trying different ones over and over again, watching countless YouTube review videos and comparisons, stalking eCommerce sites and feeling disappointed on being told how stocks reach India often years after the actual release date.\n\nAfter bugging Furtados for weeks, they finally got 1 unit from Mumbai just for me. \n\nWhat followed was the bigger challenge of finding an auto that night from Koramangala to HSR Layout. With the store closing, it starting to rain and with no cabs seemingly available, my pocket was relieved of another 350\/- by the great Bangalore auto anna experience. \n\nFurther adventures followed, like me dropping *freaking* moisturizer through the grill, over the tube of the preamp, within a week. What luck, I mean, maybe I would use moisturizer once a year? and for it to drip in the exact few centimetres where it shouldn't. \n\nGreat amp though. Been 4 months away already. Looking forward to practicing on it again whenever I do return back to Bangalore or maybe vacate my flat and get everything shipped to Bhilai?

He spoke about toxic productivity, something many of us have struggled with but perhaps without realising it. We have seen key workers and their tireless commitment to public service. We have seen people make the most of staying at home by learning new skills, starting exercise routines or volunteering in the neighbourhood. We naturally compare ourselves to each other and if we feel like we're not being as productive as we could or should be, this can have a negative effect on our wellbeing.\n.\nLike thousands of others, Alex has been on furlough. Even though he has struggled during this time, he has found happiness knowing that he is loved by God and can be used by God. Adapting Jesus' famous Beatitudes from the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5), Alex summarises: \u201CBlessed are the furloughed for they will find fulfilment, purpose and their identity in God.\u201D Alex's testimony is available to watch now on IGTV.\n.\nIf you'd like to learn more about faith and what it means to be a Christian, send us a message.

The unibrow is now semi-permanent as the paint stained her face. \n- Pieter made use of the kitchen to desk Kauai service this morning to order his smoothie.

Lovely customers again, the demographic is so wide here, so many interesting insights into diverse lives and experiences. Met a fab couple tonight: way too young to be teachers üòÄ, vegan pizza ordered and they told us that their lockdown was completely furloughed free time. They teach in an inner city school. No point in online lessons, most of their pupils have little access to the digital world, few have more than one computer in the house, and the school quickly realised that teaching via a mobile phone was unfeasable. But they are hopeful and optimistic about the autumn term, they will pick up where they left off and scoop those kids up back into learning. We asked the question Pubs vs Schools and they laughed and said that honestly both were doable, and besides, after a difficult week they deserved a beer or two. Second that.

First time I ever wore a masküò∑. I am not against wearing a mask and Please keep in mind that I live in The Netherlands where the covid situation was not like other countries so the restrictions were different for us. Wearing surgical mask doesn\u2019t prevent you from getting virus.! Social distancing is the most important.! It is for your own safety but I want to write about this with medicine expertise around me. But that\u2019s for another day üòä\n.\n.\nAnyways, Few weeks ago, I went to Lille, France. It\u2019s approximately 2,5 hours by car. It was our first day trip after the lockdown. We have been to Lille many times before but this time, it was different. It was too crowded. It\u2019s always busy on Saturdays but this weekend was something different.\n.\n.\nI thought France was hit bad by covid19 so people will be more cautious. I thought people will keep social distance like people in The Netherlands. I was expecting people in malls like here and people are more cautious by themselves. This was not the case in France. People were even not remaining distance in queue. So we didn\u2019t go to any store. I wanted to look for some clothes for my son but the situation was quite worse there üôÇ.\n.\n.\nSo the face mask was compulsory in the stores and restaurants. We wanted to go to a restaurant but couldn\u2019t because of no masks. We were never obliged to wear a mask in The Netherlands because there was never a strict lockdown here like other countries. The masks are only compulsory in the public transport which we don\u2019t use these days.\n.\n.\nWhen the situation was worse here, we didn\u2019t go out at all, my husband went to grocery store or we got home delivery for everything we needed. But the things got better soon. I only went to my garden and that was my outing üòä but better to be safe than sorry. Things got better here and there is still no obligation of wearing masks in stores, restaurants or malls (the situation will be changing soon though). People are careful by themselves. So back to mask, my first mask was in France and this is the picture of my first mask which we bought from a pharmacy.\n.\n.\nDo you have a mask story?

And yesterday was another reminder of the weird times we're living in. I think for many people the idea of not spending it with their loved ones was just too painful to skip. We caught up with family through video calls and chats but I acknowledge that it's not the same.\n\nI'm hoping that we get some normality back next year whether it's celebrating Eid, Christmas or Diwali. I know it's tough to be away from your loved ones, especially when you're craving human interaction, but if they didn't visit you, know that they're doing what they can to keep themselves and others safe, and isn't that an act of love too?\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#lockdownthoughts #lockdowneid #motivationalthoughts #sidehustles #beinspired #staypositive #eidmemes #lifeskills #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":61,"Hashtags":["#lockdownthoughts","#lockdowneid","#motivationalthoughts","#sidehustles","#beinspired","#staypositive","#eidmemes","#lifeskills","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1596359863,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 02 11:17:43 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"an_introvert_foodie","CaptionText":"Homemade edition part 26.\n#lockdowndiaries \n*Oats banana smoothie*\nBy @sayani_creative_studio \n#drinks #drinksofinstagram #drinkspiration #drinksporn #drinkstagram #drinkspecial #drinkslover #foodaddict #foodiesforlife #foodblogger #foodblogger #foodaholic #foodism #foodgawker #foodiswhyimbroke #foodphotography ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è","NumberOfLikes":36,"Hashtags":["#lockdowndiaries","#drinks","#drinksofinstagram","#drinkspiration","#drinksporn","#drinkstagram","#drinkspecial","#drinkslover","#foodaddict","#foodiesforlife","#foodblogger","#foodblogger","#foodaholic","#foodism","#foodgawker","#foodiswhyimbroke","#foodphotography"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by √Énannya on August 02, 2020.

And you can see, if you scroll down, they took my Mandala to a whole new level. \n\nDuring this lockdown, all I had was my simple black pen (since all of my stationery\u2019s at my hostel, in Delhi).

I slept and procrastinated the most during the lockdownüòú. But still, there were many positive points to say about 2020.\n\nFirst, the #covid19 pandemic taught us many things. To give healthcare priority. To live a disciplined life. To respect nature. It also gave us a glimpse about what goodness we get if we stopped polluting the environment. It made us value every small thing in life, be friends, school, or parents. And there are many other things to say, let me know in the comments about what you feel.\n\nSecond, the death of beloved @sushantsinghrajput opened up to us the plague of nepotism in the #bollywood industry and made us realize the importance of talent over connections and hereditary advantages.\n\nThird, the introduction of the #neweducationpolicy2020\nwas a welcome move by the Government of India.\n.\n.\n.\nLike and follow my account for more #funny memes!\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#meme #memes #memedaily #memesdaily #memesdailyüòÇ #dailymeme #dailymemes #coronavirus #chinavirus #sarscov2 #lockdown #lockdownmeme #lockdownmemes #lockdownstories #lockdowndiaries #tech #technology #techmemes #techmeme #technologymeme #technologymemes #mkbhd #maichekazar #goemchobakar #goemkarmemer #ckmkb","NumberOfLikes":7,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#bollywood","#neweducationpolicy2020","#funny","#meme","#memes","#memedaily","#memesdaily","#memesdailyüòÇ","#dailymeme","#dailymemes","#coronavirus","#chinavirus","#sarscov2","#lockdown","#lockdownmeme","#lockdownmemes","#lockdownstories","#lockdowndiaries","#tech","#technology","#techmemes","#techmeme","#technologymeme","#technologymemes","#mkbhd","#maichekazar","#goemchobakar","#goemkarmemer","#ckmkb"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Goemkar Memer in Airstrip One, Oceania with @mkbhd, @twitter, @hanv_alexpereira, and @brownques_.

As delicious as it sounds #vegan #glutenfree #dairyfree Recipe @pabrecipes.\n\nWho would have thought so few ingredients can yield something so deliciously good! This cherry ice cream is wicked good, and as simple as can be. I make cherry ice with mascarpone every summer, sometimes a roasted plum and cream ice cream too. Had a couple of tins of coconut cream chilling in the fridge and this just happened to come together. It is delightful on the palate, light, deep in flavour and so satisfying. \n\nIf you have a bunch of cherries, you must make this. Throw in a few plums if you like. I think this was the most fun ice cream I made this summer! I know where my next tin of coconut cream is going! Do you?\n\nOh and we have the last few seats remaining for my Online Food Styling Workshop this weekend.

My brain is constantly asking, \u2018is it nap time yet?\u2019 üë∂ üçº I know I\u2019m not really tired, I\u2019m just SO bored and fed up. \n\u2022\nIt\u2019s important to point out that I know feeling tired and uninspired is a first world problem.

So all I\u2019m doing right now is the usual things to keep myself fit and healthy (exercise, eating well, sleeping the best I can etc) and, most importantly, being kind to myself. I\u2019ve taken the foot off the gas and stopped exhausting myself by expecting myself to function like a robot. It\u2019s hard though, especially when you\u2019re used to putting 150 percent into everything you do. But, realistically, my output and motivation is not going to be the same as it was pre Covid. I\u2019m an extrovert and this situation isn\u2019t designed for people like me. Putting more and more pressure on myself to perform is just going to drain me of the energy I need to preserve to get to the finish line. \n\u2022\nWe\u2019ve got no idea when this scenario will end and when normality will return.

Being with others is key to happiness\n\nI\u2019ve gained a newfound appreciation for in-person get-togethers. Making more time in my life to be with the people I love and to express affection when we are together is something to bring forward from this experience.\n\n2. Slowing down\n\nOne silver lining of staying at home is that it\u2019s forced many of us to slow down. Perhaps you\u2019ve finally learned to meditate\u2014something you\u2019d heard was good for you but never really attempted or maybe you have read that book you hadn't been able to find time for in the past. Check out @carlhonore the slow master.\n\n3. Our health is like our family we only miss it when its gone\n\nWe have realised how important our health is because once it's gone you can't get it back. Our body is our temple and our vehicle through life. Nothing else matters if our body is affected negatively. We have learnt that we literally owe it to ourselves to keep our body's working optimally as much as possible.\n\n4. Showing gratitude matters\n\nBefore the pandemic, most of us probably didn\u2019t think twice about the workers doing these frontline jobs. Now that they are on our radar, it\u2019s been heartwarming to show appreciation openly by making signs, clapping or howling out our windows at night. I see more strangers talking and building communities than ever before. \n\n5. Nature had a break from us\n\nCleaner air and a rise in wildlife populations in cities these are a few of the positive affects less human activity had on our cities. With global warming looming and plastic filling our oceans this has given us time to aprecaite the earth and I myself plan my next car to be electric and for now I will start cycling to work!\n\nWe must not negate or ignore our terrible losses. However as a Coach for greater good, I see these positives coming from this crisis too. Reflecting on this moment has been a learning opportunity for me and for all of us\u2014a chance to focus more on what matters and to think about living life differently going forward.\n\nBook your free Personal Training consultation now‚û°Ô∏èlink in bio‚¨ÜÔ∏èüí™üòÉ","NumberOfLikes":18,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Damo's Personal Training in Damo's Personal Training with @carlhonore.
