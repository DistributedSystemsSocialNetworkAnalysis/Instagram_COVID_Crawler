(FB PAGE : Binal's collection of Short Stories and Quotes)\n\nOnce upon a time, there lived a tailor and her son. One day, due to school holiday, the son visited his mother tailor's work-place. \nBeing too young, his mother made him sit on a stool nearby, at a distance from where they could both see each other. Son saw that his mother would use scissors to cut the clothes, and then would keep aside the scissors besides her feet. Then she would sew clothes with the needle and thread, and after sewing would keep the needles on the scarf worn on the head. \nAfter looking on this sequel for half a dozen times, the son went over to his mother, and said \"May i ask you a question mother?\" Mother replied 'Yes son, what do you want to ask?'\nSon - \"Mother, i am seeing you since a long time. When you cut the clothes, after that you tuck the scissors below your feet; and after you sew the clothes, you keep the needles on your head. Why so?\" \nThe answer which his mother gave,  seemed like she gave an entire life's lesson to her son in two lines. \nMother answered lovingly, \"Son, the scissors work is to cut, and needles work is to sew; And a cutters' place is always down(below), but a sewers place is always at the top. This is the reason that i keep the needles on my scarf and scissors below the feet.\" \n\nMoral:\nIf in Life one wants to reach to the Top, Then one should be Like a Needle and SEW, and not be a Scissor (cutter).\n\nDo like, share and comment this story.\nVisit this section, for more such stories and Quotes at \nFacebook.com\/storiesandquotes1\nAnd\nHappy Reading üôÇ\n\nFollow me @artbyforam for more of such arts‚ù§\n.\nDM for Order!\n\n#pencilsketch #realisticdrawing #sketch #sketchartist #pencildrawing #art #artist #artwork #artistsoninstagram #artistsofinstagram #artoftheday #artofinstagram #sketchbook #sketching #sketches #sketchbookdrawing #sketchoftheday #sketchdaily #sketchaday #sketchart #sketchers #pencil #pencilart #pencils #potrait #lockdowndiaries #darshanraval #bluefamily #Darshaners #singlepencilsketch","NumberOfLikes":31,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1596119988,"LocalDate":"Thu Jul 30 16:39:48 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#rasmalaicake‚ù§Ô∏è #looksyummy #purelyhomemadeüëåüëåüòãüòã #lockdowndiaries #newchefintown #trythisnext #loveislove ‚ù£Ô∏èüíû#thankyou @_dancing_oven_ for giving this taste and wish you all the very best for your upcoming future üòä","NumberOfLikes":33,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1596119611,"LocalDate":"Thu Jul 30 16:33:31 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Tag your biggest celebrity crush in the comment section üëá. \n\nDedicating this one to all the lover boys out there.. üî•. \nIn frame : @ashutoshbanekar @__itz_shubh__ \n\n#hhfamilyindia #staycreative #danceduo #instagramdancers  #salman","NumberOfLikes":419,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":184,"Timestamp":1596119456,"LocalDate":"Thu Jul 30 16:30:56 CEST 2020","Location":"Pune, Maharashtra"},{"CaptionText":"Tried something new üòä\nSwipe for a tiny surprise...\n.\n#art #artgram #artist #art_community #artistsoninstagram #artwork #gouache #gouachepainting #gouachepaint #gouacheillustration #gouacheart #dalerrowney #dalerrowneygouache #pinterestinspired #pinterestart #mixedmediaart #colourpencilart #colorpencilart #mixedmediapainting #pomegranate #fruittree #indianartist #artstudy #artdailydose #lockdownlife #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":38,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":7,"Timestamp":1596119302,"LocalDate":"Thu Jul 30 16:28:22 CEST 2020","Location":"Kolkata"},{"CaptionText":"#lockdowndiaries #quarintinethought #zindagi #tanhaiyan #sadlyf #instadaily #instagood #instamood #instagram #like4likes","NumberOfLikes":30,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Rachna Das on July 30, 2020.

The outside world has changed so much, so much so that everything we had planned to do with Jackson as he was growing up now can\u2019t be done.\nHe\u2019s never been swimming, never been to a farm to see the animals, never been to an indoor play area and I have no idea when or if he will ever be able to do any of the activities we had planned for him.\n\nI\u2019m forever worrying if Jackson\u2019s bored or fed up of being at home all the time, if he\u2019s happy each day, if I\u2019m being a good enough mum for him, if the house is presentable enough (I know I obsess far too much about how the house looks but if it\u2019s a mess or not how I like it it gives me such bad anxiety and I just can\u2019t relax till it\u2019s sorted), if Jackson\u2019s eating enough, if he\u2019s eating the right things, should we have a better routine, the list is endless!! And being at home so much really makes you overthink everything which is super shit and on top of not feeling good enough each day is pretty draining.\n\nBut even though I feel rubbish every single day at the moment, just like most other mums we just push aside our own thoughts and feelings and try and be the best we can. Because like the quote says we\u2019ve always thought we can\u2019t do it, we can\u2019t carry on, yet hear we are, still going strong each and everyday doing it all for our babies, we\u2019ve got this!üí™‚ù§Ô∏è\n\n#mumguilt #mumpower #mumstogether #selfisolation #lockdown2020 #covid19 #wevegotthis #staystrong #allforyou #mystory #mythoughts #mydiary #lockdowndiaries #notgoodenough #keepgoing","NumberOfLikes":2,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by LockdownDiaries-FCJ in Daventry, Northamptonshire.

I had so many plans for this year especially for Summers, I still do but those are different from the ones I made before this pandemic hit us. When I first got the news from work that we have to work from home until further notice, I thought its a matter of a few weeks and everything will be back to normal. Who knew that the \"normal\" is about to change.\n\nWhere adjustments began:\n- Staying at homes at all times and setting up a workstation remotely\n- Checking up on family and friends and news for constant updates\n- Hoarding essentials and rationing stock\n- Sanitizing - maniacally\n- Cleaning, cooking, mopping - \n\nWhere the new normal was built:\n- The daily routine started to fall in place. \n- Everyone knew of their duties and it became like a clockwork. \n- Gyms were closed, so an exercise regime was made for home. \n- Never-ending video chats with friends and family. \n- \"Once upon a time\u201D connections kind of bloomed again.\n\nWhere acceptance kicked in:\n- A realization dawned that this wasn't a short phase of displacement. This will be the new normal. \n- Making new plans and moving forward in life became the goal. \n- No more grocery deliveries, take precautions and get them yourself. \n- Saving for a rainy day or a big-ticket purchase became important.\n- Sanitization became slightly less rigorous. \n- Started meeting family and extremely close friends because you know - \u201CZindagi Na Milegi Dobara\u201D \n\nWhere hope became part of life:\n- We came closer to the people we call family. \n- The focus shifted inwards vs outwards. \n- Great learnings about self and surroundings took place.\n- Home-cooked food became the most important part of daily life.\n- Health, nutrition, immunity was back with a bang and people felt the need to focus on it. \n\nAll in all, this indeed became a great learning experience - of not taking things for granted, after all - \u201CKal Ho Na Ho\u201D!!\n\nWriter: @tanupriyas is an IT professional in New Jersey, USA.\n\n#lockdowntravel\n#lockdown2020 \n#randomwriter \n#pandemiclife \n#writerslife \n#storytelling \n#storyteller \n#randomness \n#creativelifehappylife \n#writers","NumberOfLikes":32,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1595927902,"LocalDate":"Tue Jul 28 11:18:22 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Khane se jyada taane kha rha hun aajkal.\n#lockdowndiaries \n.\n.\n.#memes #funny #lockdown #taane #food #deadinside","NumberOfLikes":1,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by DEAD INSIDE (MEMESü§°) on July 28, 2020.

It\u2019s the day my lovely cleaner of 15 years comes. So it\u2019s a mad dash to enjoy my #onepeloton ride , shower, go for a walk and return home!! In case one son isn\u2019t up or the other working at home to let her in.\n\nGreat one peloton ride with one of pelotons Kings of R&B @benjaminalldis Gosh I was tired today, & performance fell short. Wet but warm day 16¬∞ C, so  cagoule in tow for the walk, though not needed once it stopped spitting!! Few in the park, but not regulars. Must be people who prefer a walk when it\u2019s wet üòä\n\nBack to the cleaners day, having watched me over the years whilst visiting, my late dad has an acronym CBC \u201Ccleaning before the cleaner\u201D.. Hubby says what\u2018s the point of the cleaner if you are going to do all this cleaning before! Can anyone relate to this?? So you don\u2019t want the cleaner to come and find the place too bad so you do some cleaning before. House full of men and they don\u2019t get it!!\n\nNow lock down is gradually being eased, I was entertaining over the weekend!! First set of visitors , niece, hubby plus a cute baby. Haven\u2019t carried a baby in at least a year and he was so sweet. It was good to have family round and share some laughs. Sunday was a send off party, for another niece heading to study in Canada. So it was a full on weekend!! \n\nBeen thinking about holidays saying keep holiday plans fluid, but I didn\u2019t know quite how fluid it would be until the UK Govt reintroduced 14 day quarantine for visitors returning from Spain with practically no notice.. That\u2019s exactly where we were gearing up to going to after we finished a small project here!! That\u2019s scuppered that one , so maybe it\u2019s officially got to be staycation!! Will explore options. Tonight will be my first restaurant visit!! Not sure how I will feel yet. I said I was a little apprehesive. Might also be first time on a train if I don\u2019t drive...

But I mistimed myself and prep took longer than anticipated, which is why it got pushed to dinner. Another frankie recipe. Another attempt, hoping it would taste something like Tibbs Frankie. This time it was Mumbai Style Chicken Frankie. It had a dry Frankie masala, a wet tangy chutney, chilli in vinegar, raw onions to garnish, the chicken of course, and the wraps made this time with maida, coated with egg (decided to skip the healthy whole wheat option). This was the first time I was working with full maida dough. So it kind of got sticky and I had to get the bread chef (the missus) to help undo the damage, if any. Any case, it worked and the egg coated wraps were ready, Mumbai style. Finally assembled it and got it to the table. It wasn\u2019t Tibbs, but it was nice. I liked the addition of the tangy chutney (had omitted it the last time). Will I make it again? Yup, but with a few changes and probably add some wheat flour to make the dough more manageable.

Extremely malnourished and badly affected with Mange and Scabies.\nHis eyes said he wanted to live.\nI was scared as he was too small a baby to administer drugs and care. Finances was too a major hurdle as after feeding and treating 470+ dogs daily, you're hardly left with more money to send him at a specialized shelter for skin treatment.\nSomeone had once said kachre ke dibbe ka bhi waqt badalta hain, ye toh phir bhi kukur hain. Jeeta jaagta kukur.\n\nTook the risk. Got him home. \nAnd here he is today. Already ready to fly to his forever loving home on this coming weekend.\nGratitude Ashwin Krishnan Sir for your support throughout and @world_of_kuntalika for the cage.

Hope this helps you in some manner, Sharing this from my personal experience. \n\n\u2022Affection : Start with things Your child is fond of,Every child is fond of some toy or some book, So to start with make an activity around it ,so soon he will join you.\n\n\u2022Bribe : A child's attention span is less than 20 minutes, so bribe them with chocolate, cookies or their favourite sticker, smiley or star. So they will finish their task fast as they can. So that they get their reward. \n\n\u2022 Build curiosity : Every child is curious and have many questions in mind,Prepare the activity in front of them. In a polite manner just say \"Can u please help me\" If they ask what is it, just say it's a surprise game for them, kids loves surprises. \n\n\u2022 Visual communication: Show and read a lot of pictorial books, Do a lot of picture talk because kids grab visuals more than verbal.  Reading helps in building child's vocabulary.\n\n\u2022 Appreciation:  Always appreciate and encourage these little ones whether they are doing their work well or trying it, always pat their back and say you are doing a GOOD JOB. \"Keep it up\"\n\n\u2022Be patient: Spending whole day working we tend to get tire & frustrated, after that we sit with our child to study and they don't listen to ours or run away, we tend to lose our patience and give it up, don't give up, keep trying and make studies fun them, they will sit one day with ours\n\n\u2022Parents are First Teacher :Parents know their child better than anyone else. As they spend more time with ours and imitate whatever we do, so beware of your actions. Our kids don't have anyone else, except ours, so remove some time in between from your busy schedule, talk to them, play with them, dance, sing, read and do all the madness in what they enjoy. Trust me the smile on your child's face will make your forget your entire day's tiredness and get a smile on your face too. \n\n#panicmommie #stories #lockdowndiaries #beattheboredom #fun2learn #tips","NumberOfLikes":33,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":6,"Timestamp":1595784933,"LocalDate":"Sun Jul 26 19:35:33 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#taabeerlockdown #lockdowndiaries #lockdownlife #lockdown2020 #shotoniphone #delhidiaries #aftersunset #aftersunsetphotography #coronavacation #shadowwork #shadowshoot @vivre.hinducollege","NumberOfLikes":23,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Amit shokeen on July 26, 2020.

It shouldn\u2019t take a global pandemic for us to be reminded to be kind and loving towards others x\n\nüéàRETHINK YOUR PRIORITIES - being together with your family and keeping them safe is much more important than going out with friends and risking the health of your family.

Only weeks after the U.K. included Spain on a list of countries safe for summer holidays, the government reversed course and announced late Saturday it would impose a 14-day quarantine on anyone arriving from Spain. The move came after cases in the country jumped, particularly in the Catalonia region, where authorities are racing to stamp out new outbreaks. Norway on Friday announced a 10-day quarantine for people returning from Spain, and France issued new travel warnings for the Catalonia region, which is home to Barcelona and popular beaches. The moves will further weigh on bookings in the peak travel period for a country that depends on tourism for more than 10% of gross domestic product. Spain\u2019s health ministry reported more than 920 new cases on both Thursday and Friday, the highest numbers since early May, when the government began easing one of Europe\u2019s strictest lockdowns.\n.\n.\nDo follow and share @the_recent.column for latest updates.\n.\n.\n#spain #spainstagram #spaingram #instaspain #recentnews #recentcolumn #worldgram #worldnewsdaily #worldnews #europe #european #pandemic2020 #covid19 #covidnews #florida #norway #barcelonaspain #barcelona #france #uk #french #catalonia #cataloniaroyaltulum #lockdown #lockdown2020 #lockdownlife #lockdowndiaries #tourism #spain_photographs #spain_passion","NumberOfLikes":9,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The_Recent.Column on July 26, 2020.

I began following @abhishekhanna and seeing his stellar work, and I thought to myself - maybe I can give this a try! ‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nAnd fortuitously enough - my mom made this sumptuous curry for the day. I shellebrated, because I knew then and there that this would be an Ande Funday. (I'll stop with the bad yolks now, hope they made you crack up xD) My mom had sourced the ripest, reddest tomatoes and I was dying to use them in a shoot. So I grabbed a few from the kitchen, along with some other accoutrements - lemons, garlic, coriander, and some chillies! We also had two chopping boards neatly stacked in the bottom shelf, which I planned to use as the base.‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nI then proceeded to MasterChef the hell out of that curry - sprinkling the leaves, arranging the accompaniments around the centerpiece in the most decorative manner possible. And finally, I turned on my camera! These are some of my favorite shots from the day :))‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nI've never really spent much time in the kitchen, besides helping myself to an extra serving of that delish payasam. I spend more time at the dinner table, refining my Michelin Man look. As the popular old saying goes - The best way to a man's heart is through his stomach!‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nI've been super lazy, forgive me.

So, while travelling in this costume from Bangalore to Kolkata in the mid of Corona, I was having some  funny thoughts that I'm going to share today:\n\n- I remembered my college days when I once tracked the evidence of the thief who stole my mobile & how finally i got hold of her. And today, looking at me, I feel I am dressed like a burglur with full protection wearing mask, face shield, gloves so that not a trace of fingerprint is visible on any object I steal & nobody should recognize me.\n\n- Secondly, I was thinking that in this generation, almost all science grads aspire to become software engineers. Now, keeping this attire in mind, I guess our next generation would like to be an astronaut from a very tender age itself & will dream of Moon mission soon.

Machines have started to slowly replace the traditional method of rice cultivation but a field with a wooden yoke and a pair of ox has a charm of its own! üòÄ\nRice is a staple food for the people of the hilly regions. To grow our own rice is a great way of being self sustainable. We allow small farmers to work in our fields. They put all their knowledge and experience into the fields thus helping us and themselves in the process and also saving a dying form of agriculture.\nPloughing a field, especially when there are small terraces is a tricky and challenging task. It requires a good amount of experience, energy and good farming skills. There's so much work going on. The hardwork will pay off in a few months with the sight of lush green knee deep paddy fields! üå±üåø\nPraying for a good harvest üåæüåæüåæ\n--------------------------------------------------------\n#paddycultivation #rice #paddyfield #homegrown #beautifulsky #clouds #lockdowndiaries #traditionalfarming #waterfarming #mountains #rainyseason #bluesky #landscape #nature #riceterraces #mountainlover #mountainview #farmer #cleanfarming #growtoeat #growyourownfood #hills #lifeinahillstation #wanderlust #auksfarmstories #auksfarm #adreamatatime #darjeelinghomestays #darjeelingtourism #responsibletourism","NumberOfLikes":236,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1595744420,"LocalDate":"Sun Jul 26 08:20:20 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Sooji ka Halwa, Family ka pyaar..... \nYe hi to zaroorat hai mere yaar ü§óü•∞\n\nIn Frame : Sooji ka halwaüçÆ\n\nüòéDo you knowü§î\n\n‚ù§Suji is a Cuisine of India and a kesar\/saffron-flavored variation of this is the Kesari sheera.
