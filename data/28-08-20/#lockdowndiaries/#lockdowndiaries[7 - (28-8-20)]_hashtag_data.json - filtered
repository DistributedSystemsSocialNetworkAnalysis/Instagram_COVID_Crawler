There were other aspects he enjoyed too.\n\u201CIt was great to be forced to slow down in my personal life. There were no interruptions and I was able to spend more time with my boyfriend Janusz.

My boyfriend feels ashamed of it,\u201D he said.\nThe couple, who met two years ago, have no plans to leave Brighton. \n\u201CNowhere else is as accepting. The people make it what it is.

Thanks to my foodie friend @manthenaanupama for the suggestion. Contrasting textures like smooth & crispy can never go wrong.  Monsoon is my favourite season minus this year of course. But in general it gears up your mood,  the relaxation from heat, the new playlist for drive, the switch from chocolate shakes to hot chocolate, the guilt free fried food menu, after all we take only those things for granted which are the closest, case in point fried food here. All this most definitely gives you a different high.  I haven\u2019t felt more connected to food what lockdown has made me feel. A deep sense of gratitude for every small ingredient that I get on time at my door step when I am genuinely craving to cook something fancy. Every plate I cook makes me so excited.

I havent written any poems, done any crafts or written opinion articles. It\u2019s not that I havent tried. I have. But my \u201Ccreative juices\u201D 🧃have been wrung dry. \n.\nThis #lockdown has given us free time , perhaps too much free time. 🕙 Time that I otherwise would have been spent studying, at university or out with my friend. Now I had all this free time, it was a little overwhelming.  Having intensely focused on filling the gaps in my days with something creative, it made that time feel more obligatory than inspired. \n.\nSoon enough I realised that I did not have to conquer the world in one day. So I decided to stop trying to cram everything into 24hours and instead take time to focus on me and engage in creative and mind freeing activities when it felt necessary. As my mum says : \u201Ctoo much of anything is never good for you\u201D\n.\nDuring this time I allowed myself to detach from the moment and focus on me. An activity which helped me a lot with this was #yoga 🧎🏽\u200D♀️ ( not the intense flexible yoga, more of the sit on the floor and listen to calming music one ). It helped me to be more mindful and selfaware and it is something I highly recommend to others. Even if it\u2019s just for a few minutes in the morning, trust me it really helps ! \n. \nPS .

We all dressed up, popped on a bit of Mariah and Michael Buble, all set our tables, cooked up a storm, and then logged on to eat together. The kids then took over the conversation with filters, dance parties and giggles. And now we wait for them to fall asleep and the grown ups will log back on for a little online game of Cards Against Humanity. 🥂👏🏻\n\nAnd tomorrow? We will plan something else to pop in the diary to take our mind off things and bring a smile to our faces. \n\nWe can do this.

She says COVID-19 has presented the biggest challenge of her career.\n\u201CI\u2019ve worked during swine flu and have written flu plans in the past, but nothing prepares you for this. It\u2019s been a continuous learning process. In spite of everything, I believe all the NHS and key workers have done an amazing job. In the NHS we acted on guidance and worked well together in Sussex across the NHS and social care. Lots of people were redeployed to support the response. It showed that NHS and social care staff are really flexible and happy to muck in.\u201D\nKaty is leading on winter planning for NHS Sussex.\n\u201CBuilt into that plan is the possibility of a second peak. We\u2019re modelling different scenarios to make sure we have enough capacity - not just for Covid, but for operations, care homes and nursing homes. The recovery programme must also address backlogs in other areas. It\u2019s a big challenge.\u201D\nKaty has personal as well as professional experience of the pandemic as both her father and her father-in-law died in care homes during lockdown.\n\u201CMy husband\u2019s father died of Covid in Manchester on April 9th. There were no mourners allowed at his funeral. My dad died on April 21st - not of Covid, but I wasn\u2019t able to see him for four weeks. He\u2019d been ill with Parkinsons for a long time. He lived for his family. I got a call a week before he died to say he was very ill. I was told I could go in but that I\u2019d have to wear full PPE and then he would need to be isolated for two weeks, which I didn\u2019t think was fair on him. I told him I loved him on FaceTime the night before he died, but I just felt I could have done better for him. I wanted to hold his hand.\u201D\nKaty, whose parents were together for 52 years, says the whole family is devastated by his loss. But they aren\u2019t angry because that\u2019s not what he would have wanted.\n\u201CMy dad was a true gentleman. When I told him I wouldn\u2019t be able to see him, he said, \u2018that\u2019s an inconvenience\u2019. That\u2019s the way he was - very caring and gentle. I want to carry that on.\u201D\n#brightonandhove #documentingbritain #hove #hoveactually","NumberOfLikes":99,"Hashtags":["#brightonandhove","#documentingbritain","#hove","#hoveactually"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Brighton Peeps in Hove Seafront with @justinedesmondphoto, @kag40, and @daisyoclee.

The importance of the last 10 days of this month is a worthy knowledge. The pandemic has made way for many \u201Cfirsts\u201D in our lives. A very different Bakrid is surely one of them too.

The pre-recorded interviews take place via Zoom and are posted every Tuesday afternoon. You can find them all on the Different Strokes website, Facebook page and YouTube channel - but over the next couple of weeks, a snippet of each already posted to the DS channels are going to be introduced to our wonderful Instagram audience, to give everyone a taster of personal affiliation with each survivor.\u2063\n\u2063\nLockdown interview number four features stroke survivors Sheelagh and Greet. Sheelagh is our Administrator at Different Strokes. She had her stroke in 2018 at the age of 51. Greet works for the NHS and had her stroke just six months ago at the age of 45. Greet spoke to Sheelagh about her misdiagnosis during stroke and her diagnoses after stroke - Wallenberg Syndrome and Central Post Stroke Pain. During lockdown, Greet chats about the difficulties of being disabled with social restrictions, what it\u2019s like having a vibrant little boy in the early chapters of post stroke recovery, missing out on seeing and staying with family in Belgium and replacement exercises she\u2019s been doing to substitute her usual routine. She also talks about the after effects of her stroke, how lucky she felt to be receiving quality aftercare just before the pandemic struck, problems with work, how her stroke will now give her extra empathy being a child physiotherapist in her new job and how the support from Different Strokes has helped her come to terms with her new life.\u2063\n\u2063\nCatch the full interview at:\u2063\n🔗 https:\/\/differentstrokes.co.uk\/stroke-survivor-experiences-during-lockdown\/\u2063\n▶️ https:\/\/youtu.be\/nNBMW414umk\u2063\n👍🏼 https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/differentstrokescharity\/\u2063","NumberOfLikes":17,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1595589016,"LocalDate":"Fri Jul 24 13:10:16 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"aesthetically_pleasing_girls","CaptionText":"@aazthasharma \n\n#savage #glam #gladiator #gladiatorheels #black #ootd #ootn #outfitinspo #stairs #indoorphotography #poser #fitgirls #instadaily #instagood #outfitoftheday #quarantine #lockdowndiaries #dressup  #homephotoshoot #kneehigh #shoes #shoelover #shoesaddict #style #styleblogger #blogger #photography #indoor #black #xoxo","NumberOfLikes":3,"Hashtags":["#savage","#glam","#gladiator","#gladiatorheels","#black","#ootd","#ootn","#outfitinspo","#stairs","#indoorphotography","#poser","#fitgirls","#instadaily","#instagood","#outfitoftheday","#quarantine","#lockdowndiaries","#dressup","#homephotoshoot","#kneehigh","#shoes","#shoelover","#shoesaddict","#style","#styleblogger","#blogger","#photography","#indoor","#black","#xoxo"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by pics on July 24, 2020.

My saree pallu drape has changed with the time so would like to share one memory connected to it in short. Since childhood I have been around beautiful ladies with colorful sarees full time and highly fascinated by them.\n\nWhen I got engaged, I used to drape in 1. Pleated pallu style as I was not fully confident and was too much concern about saree coming out 😬. \nAfter marriage 2.Head drape was compulsory and as I was not use to it I use to put so many pins on head to set the pallu.\nDuring pregnancy I use to prefer 3. Wrapped around shoulder drape to cover my tummy ( use to feel shy😜).When kids were small half of the time my saree pallu was 4.  tucked in petticoat for free movement.\n Later when kids grew up was little free from taking them in Lap so started with 5. Flowing drape. \nToday when girls grew up , I take help of my girls in styling my sarees and selection of  blouse and accessories. Now I am 100% confident and I love to wear and carry myself  in different styles. Being a saree lover,I love to try and  take  saree styling  to newer, trendier heights.\nYou may not realize, but the modest pallu has the power to make or break your saree look from traditional to uber chic by varying pallu drapes. I remember sometimes I use to do certain changes while tieing  and carrying  saree and pallu to look slimmer,  taller, sometimes to add an illusion of weight.🙈\n\n❓Ladies Which one is your fav pallu drape ???\nAnd gentlemens which drape you like the most???\n123\n456\n\nDo share your pallu drape stories👍\n#smilemore #photooftheday❤️ #styleblogger #style \n#lockdowndiaries #loveforsarees❤️\n#motivationalquotes #chennaiinfluencer #chennaimommyblogger  #spiritualawakening #instamom #mommybloggers #mombloggersofindia  #fashionlover #fashionbloggerindia #igram #explorepage #stylegram #lookoftheday  #affordablefashion  #styleblogger  #pictoftheday  #fashionlover #fashionbloggerindia #igram #stylegram #iconiclook #personalstyle #ss07insta # brands2bloggers","NumberOfLikes":146,"Hashtags":["#smilemore","#photooftheday❤️","#styleblogger","#style","#lockdowndiaries","#loveforsarees❤️","#motivationalquotes","#chennaiinfluencer","#chennaimommyblogger","#spiritualawakening","#instamom","#mommybloggers","#mombloggersofindia","#fashionlover","#fashionbloggerindia","#igram","#explorepage","#stylegram","#lookoftheday","#affordablefashion","#styleblogger","#pictoftheday","#fashionlover","#fashionbloggerindia","#igram","#stylegram","#iconiclook","#personalstyle","#ss07insta"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Meraki on July 24, 2020.

Link to the song is in my bio. \n\nWhen the #lockdown had first started in India, was unsure on what to do next.. The #commercial impact apart, there was a likely #creative impact too.. So decided to just work out a way to make a song end-to-end at home itself with whatever resources that were available.. Taking a simple progression & a simple thought ahead \" I'll be there you \" was born.. Little did I expect the feedback that was to follow and now that Songdew came forward to take it up for a digital platforms release, it is one of the most fulfilling moments to have my first effort in production reach this far.. \n\nAcknowledging the importance of the moment, I did get the song re-mastered at @graysparkaudio so that it's fit for release on #streamingplatforms so thanks to @ronakrunwal for giving it the finishing touch. \n\nSorry for the long post..

There is no professional help in running the household and everything is on you and the members of the family. Some have lost their jobs, while for some, there are extended work hours because nobody knows now when the working day begins and when it ends.⠀\n⠀\nPeople are putting in more than 14 hours a day at work; the current work from home style involves dependence on digital devices for longer than before which has its own set of inbuilt harmful consequences. These actions can have a damaging effect on psychology. ⠀\n⠀\nTherapy is very useful and often Self Therapy gains a prominent role during times of uncertainty to feel more grounded.

Add to that 'noise' - not just literal sounds but also an endless chatter inside my head. My old, self-doubting narrative kept questioning me: \"Meher, how will you manage this?\" Blah, blah, blah.\n👇\nTranscending my narrative has involved years of conscious efforts to build a structured routine with consistent places and times for different activities. And then all of those things were meshed into mush when #covid19quarantine happened. How could I work in the space I sleep in? It confused me to outer space! 😕\n👇\nEarly this year, I turned to #meditation. My #selfawareness began to evolve. I realised that I had let my narrative, my set of #limitingbeliefs, have the power to control me. It'd tell me I couldn't when I could, and shouldn't when I should. That's just mean! \n👇\nI then began to observe myself from a place of unconfounded awareness as thoughts took a backseat. I realised it was not about work at all. It was about my own outlook on life.\n👇\nI embraced a life of #mindfulliving, #gratitude and #selflove. The work-life 'mush' didn't seem so messy anymore. Place wasn't the concern. Timing was. And with that, my 'new' workspace gradually became 'normal' for me... among manyyy other transformations ☀️😁\n\n#thenewnormal #selfbeliefs #reflections #mindsetshifts #positivethought #changeyourlife #stayathome #fightcovid19together #lockdowndiaries #quarantine2020 #mentalwellness #mentalhealth #healthandwellness #wellness #wellnessblogger #pakistaniwellnessblogger #mindfulliving #mindfulness #mindfullymeher","NumberOfLikes":32,"Hashtags":["#workingfromhome","#covid19quarantine","#meditation.","#selfawareness","#limitingbeliefs,","#mindfulliving,","#gratitude","#selflove.","#thenewnormal","#selfbeliefs","#reflections","#mindsetshifts","#positivethought","#changeyourlife","#stayathome","#fightcovid19together","#lockdowndiaries","#quarantine2020","#mentalwellness","#mentalhealth","#healthandwellness","#wellness","#wellnessblogger","#pakistaniwellnessblogger","#mindfulliving","#mindfulness","#mindfullymeher"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by | Mindfully M.E.H.E.R | in Karachi, Pakistan.

My day use to be lot busy due to work & after that for next 2-3 days I made plans with my friends and cousins for the evening & use to return back to my hotel by night. It was used to be busy days & I didn't have time or I'll say I never took time to call back home to my parents & if they call I just use to say - I am busy will call you back. Then next couple of days I explore the city alone. Getting pack up from office work & collegues, I use to take local, get down to nearest station of the location I wanted to visit then walk back 9-10 kms to my hotel exploring the streets and places on the way.\n\nDays later I felt homesick, I called home & spoke with my parents. That time I really felt their importance, it was not like that I never knew their importance but you know there are those little moments when you feel such things more deeply. The one who gave birth to us & the one who never lost hope on us deserve importance & love than we actually give them.\n\nBut as time flies we start highlighting our differences.We start building our own wall of privacy & it they enter without our permission it angers us. In the end we sum up it as 'generation gap', the perfect excuse to avoid a talk & ending conversation with them is 'you won't understand'.\n\nYear changes & we leave our childhood behind us,we start becoming independent, not only with our finances but also at our daily routine.The need to inform,talk, daily little conversations get reduces. We start prioritizing things over them, friends,work & money suddenly seems more important.\n\nWe Learn the value of things when it's not with us & that moment when I spoke with them I felt that. That guilt of ignorance was there, at that time I was not able to express it to them.\nI felt that all we can do is appreciate their love & care & give as much importance to them while we can.
