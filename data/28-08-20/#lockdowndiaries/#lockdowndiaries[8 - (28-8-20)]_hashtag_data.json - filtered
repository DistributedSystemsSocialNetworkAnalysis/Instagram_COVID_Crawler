[{"CaptionText":"This day, this month and this year are all temporary. Just like tomorrow, next week or next year will be. Nothing stays the same, and that\u2019s a truth that I want us all to embrace. The only difference is the mindset we take forward with us. We can\u2019t change yesterday. But we have the power to take what we learn and change tomorrow. The only difference is, even if everything is temporary, we still have the ability to impact this temporarily magnificent world. The only difference is we, as people, can still live forever; as memories, lessons and smudges in the back of other people\u2019s best experience, as lovers, as carers, as friends. The only difference is yesterday made us who we are today, but what we do today decides who we will be tomorrow. And that is powerful 🤍\n- Ruby Dhal","NumberOfLikes":1211,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":18,"Timestamp":1595329410,"LocalDate":"Tue Jul 21 13:03:30 CEST 2020","Location":"Singapore"},{"CaptionText":"Fringe it is ...♥️♥️♥️\n\n#makeuptutorial #makeupartistpune #makeuptrainer #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":101,"Hashtags":["#makeuptutorial","#makeupartistpune","#makeuptrainer","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":10,"Timestamp":1595329252,"LocalDate":"Tue Jul 21 13:00:52 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"My first DIY, ditch and switch product - Face Wash!

Her presence and personality are bold and commanding, rhythms of upbeat music are her forte. When it comes to transparency with her fans, she is not afraid at all. Rexha has been suffering from bipolar disorder. Earlier she was fearful, she didn't want to consider her illness at all, but finally she worked up the courage to face her fears. Rexha first revealed her battle with bipolar disorder last April to her 1.6 million followers on Twitter.\n.\nShe wrote, \u201CFor the longest time, I didn\u2019t understand why I felt so sick. Why I felt lows that made me not want to leave my house or be around people and why I felt highs that wouldn\u2019t let me sleep, wouldn\u2019t let me stop working or creating music. Now I know why.\u201D Rexha said that throughout her life, she had experienced symptoms like mood swings, anxiousness and overwhelming depression.\n.\nAnd in the midst of it all, she was also diagnosed with premenstrual dysphoric disorder, a condition that occurs a week or two before a woman\u2019s menstrual cycle, which can cause severe irritability, depression, or anxiety. It wasn't easy confronting her illness, but the singer, along with the support of her friends and family, managed to get the right treatment and medication.\n_\nVisit us at www.cowin.live\n_\n\n#cowin #global #covid19 #who #pandemic #lockdown #globalpandemic #coronavirus #HealthForAll  #stayhome #staysafe #socialdistancing #safetymeasures #awareness #lockdowndiaries #quatantine #homebound #unitednations #technology #tech #TechnologyForGood #techstartup #techsolution #instatech #appdesign #healthcare #quarintinelife #canada #globaleconomy #indianeconomy","NumberOfLikes":10,"Hashtags":["#cowin","#global","#covid19","#who","#pandemic","#lockdown","#globalpandemic","#coronavirus","#HealthForAll","#stayhome","#staysafe","#socialdistancing","#safetymeasures","#awareness","#lockdowndiaries","#quatantine","#homebound","#unitednations","#technology","#tech","#TechnologyForGood","#techstartup","#techsolution","#instatech","#appdesign","#healthcare","#quarintinelife","#canada","#globaleconomy","#indianeconomy"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Collective Win on July 20, 2020.

His video on Triller for the\r\nsong has garnered upwards of 11.7 million global plays as of press time\r\n(July 13), according to Triller.\r\nTalking about achieving this feat, @armaanmalik says, \u201CIt\u2019s such an amazing feeling to top both these charts. As an Indian, I see this as a step forward to\r\nfurther my dream of taking India to the world.\u201D\n\r\nBollywood celebrities like Tiger Shroff, Siddhant Chaturvedi, Vishal\r\nDadlani, Salim Merchant, and more congratulated Armaan for making his\r\ncountry proud.\n\r\nReleased in the midst of the pandemic, \u201Cnext 2 me\u201D describes the feeling of\r\nmissing your loved ones and wishing they were right there by your side in a\r\nlight-hearted and hopeful manner with an uptempo production. \u201CThe global\r\nlockdown has been tough on all of us, especially for those who are\r\nquarantined away from their loved ones.

He is known as one of Hollywood\u2019s strong figures and one of the highest grossing actors. Johnson talked about the challenges he\u2019s faced in maintaining his mental health. He mentioned how \u201CStruggle and pain is real,\u201D and how depressed and devastated he felt during those times. There were days when he was \u201Ccrying constantly\u201D. A series of unfortunate events had led to the occurrence of the depression ever since he was 15. From his parents struggling to ear a living, to his mother\u2019s suicide attempt, to his injuries that made him drop out of college and let go of his dream of scholarship. Johnson faced all these events. However, he managed to pick himself up. He found his inner strength and managed to survive.

No one knows. The title of official ice cream inventor has never been awarded. What we do know is, as far back as 200 B.C., people have enjoyed variations of frozen treats. Alexander the Great loved snow flavoured with honey and nectar, biblical references have been made to King Solomon\u2019s desire of iced drinks, and Nero Claudius Caesar was known to send servants to the mountains for snow to then be flavoured with fruits and juices. However, it is the Chinese who are most often credited with the invention of today\u2019s ice cream. They figured out that packing snow into a bowl of rice and milk made a tasty treat. Then a thousand years later, Marco Polo returned home from a trip to the Far East with a recipe similar to modern day sherbet. The craze quickly spread throughout Europe\u2019s upper class, and royalty during the 1500s.\n.\n.\n\nIndia, on the other hand, boasts of an impressive history of ice cream as well. In the sixteenth century, Mughal rulers were known to send relays of horsemen to collect and transport ice from Hindu Kush to Delhi, in order to make fruit sorbets. Kulfi, referred to as the \u201Ctraditional ice cream of India\u201D, also originated in the sixteenth century, during the Mughal reign.\n\nAt present, India stands as the world\u2019s fastest growing ice cream market. As per reports, the ice cream sales in India have increased by 13 per cent per year over the last 7 years.\n.\nHappy world Ice Cream day 🍦 \n.\n#icecream #chocolateicecream #almondicecream #roastedalmondicecream #lockdown #homemade  #homechef #chocolatealmondicecream #qurantinecooking #lockdowncooking #lockdowndiaries #chocolatesauce #yummy #yummyinthetummy #dessert #desserts #summertime #coolcoolicecream #worldicecreamday #happyworldicecreamday","NumberOfLikes":27,"Hashtags":["#icecream","#chocolateicecream","#almondicecream","#roastedalmondicecream","#lockdown","#homemade","#homechef","#chocolatealmondicecream","#qurantinecooking","#lockdowncooking","#lockdowndiaries","#chocolatesauce","#yummy","#yummyinthetummy","#dessert","#desserts","#summertime","#coolcoolicecream","#worldicecreamday","#happyworldicecreamday"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by All things food in Delhi - NCR with @theterracekitchen.

Also, I\u2019ve been re-reading The Diary of Anne Frank.  That is truly a remarkable book and amazing gift to have come down to us from that horrible time in history.  I read it when I was young, but I think I appreciate it much more now that I\u2019m probably closer to the age Anne\u2019s parents were in the book. \n\nBelow is one of my favorite quotes that seems to jump through the pages and speak to our time.  It\u2019s in a section (Tues, March 7th, 1944) where Anne is talking about how she and her mother differ in how they try mentally to get through hardship. \n\nShe says of her mom: \u201CHer counsel when one feels melancholy is: \u2018Think of all the misery in the world and be glad that you are not sharing in it.\u2019\u201D And then Anne goes on: \u201CMy advice is: \u2018Go outside, to the fields, enjoy nature and the sunshine, go out and try to recapture happiness in yourself and in God.  Think of all the beauty that\u2019s still left in and around you and be happy!\u2019\u201D\n\nWise words and even more poignant that they were written when Anne was almost 15 and that she didn\u2019t live to 16.  But a miracle in a way that we have her words at all.\n\nI was struck too by this passage (in Tues, April 4th, 1944):\n\n\u201CI want to go on living even after my death!  And therefore I am grateful to God for giving me this gift, this possibility of developing myself and of writing, of expressing all that is in me.  I can shake off everything if I write; my sorrows disappear, my courage is reborn.\u201D\n\nHow wonderful that, even amidst the tragedy of her young death, her wish came true!\n.\n.\n.\n.#teddybear #teddybearlove #teddybearlovers #patchwork #patchworklovers #journalingcommunity #quranjournaling #journaling #quarantinelife #lockdownlife #lockdowndiaries #lockdownart #sendinglove #carepackage #carepackages #stationeryshop #stationerylove #bagsoflove #contradouk","NumberOfLikes":66,"Hashtags":["#teddybear","#teddybearlove","#teddybearlovers","#patchwork","#patchworklovers","#journalingcommunity","#quranjournaling","#journaling","#quarantinelife","#lockdownlife","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdownart","#sendinglove","#carepackage","#carepackages","#stationeryshop","#stationerylove","#bagsoflove","#contradouk"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1595160958,"LocalDate":"Sun Jul 19 14:15:58 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Peace making...\n\nIf you have lots of time,colours,brushes nd a piece of paper.....\n\nMake use of it ... every single time you will be happy just becoz you love to do it...\n\nEnjoy what you are doing..🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️👩\u200D🎨 \n\n#best_out_of_waste  #acrylpainting #wallwatch #artistsoninstagram #boredomatitsfinest #lockdowndiaries #2020 #art #artist #timelapse #moonlight","NumberOfLikes":37,"Hashtags":["#best_out_of_waste","#acrylpainting","#wallwatch","#artistsoninstagram","#boredomatitsfinest","#lockdowndiaries","#2020","#art","#artist","#timelapse","#moonlight"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by vidhya_msnair on July 19, 2020.","NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1595160773,"LocalDate":"Sun Jul 19 14:12:53 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Weekend vibes in balcony during lockdown!! \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#weekendvibes #lockdown2020 #apartmentdecor #apartmentgardening #balconydecor #balconygarden #apartmenttherapy #plantsmakepeoplehappy #plantsofinstagram #plantslover #dressup #lockdown #lockdowndiaries #lookoftheday #lookbook #repeat #repeatrethinkrediscover #consciousliving #blackdress #weekendtime #lockdownlife #selflove #gratitude #fashionstyle #fashionphotography","NumberOfLikes":163,"Hashtags":["#weekendvibes","#lockdown2020","#apartmentdecor","#apartmentgardening","#balconydecor","#balconygarden","#apartmenttherapy","#plantsmakepeoplehappy","#plantsofinstagram","#plantslover","#dressup","#lockdown","#lockdowndiaries","#lookoftheday","#lookbook","#repeat","#repeatrethinkrediscover","#consciousliving","#blackdress","#weekendtime","#lockdownlife","#selflove","#gratitude","#fashionstyle","#fashionphotography"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":6,"Timestamp":1595159729,"LocalDate":"Sun Jul 19 13:55:29 CEST 2020","Location":"Amanora Park Town"},{"CaptionText":"THE CITY OF INCERTITUDE\n\nNote: Responding to a prompt, I submitted a two-stanza version of this poem to my poetry class \"Sharpened Visions\" under American poet, performer, and librettist Douglas Kearney of the California Institute of the Arts.

In terms of training outdoors - yes, running was disrupted, had other plans too in my mind and they were all shut down. But training indoors was not too different for me. I have been training indoors for years now. Never been to a gym, never liked that gym culture in the first place. Always wanted something athletic, movement based, so opened one athletic centre in my basement only and built it over the years, and kept at it. But in the end for me in terms of personal growth this was just a different phase, not too difficult, in fact rewarding.\nInspite of the all the inconveniences that have been caused, here I am lauding the lockdown. But then thats what life is made of - tackling the disappointments, the set backs and carrying them on with you - in your mind - in your emotions and using them as a gift, as a blessing rather than a curse. Giving them a whole new, opposite meaning.\n\nWith this on going pandemic I have now started giving people virtual\nsessions.

Even better is the exchange between another couple, in which the wife is able to trick her husband into confessing his infidelities.\n\nThe dialogue is in Italian, but even in the English subtitles, it is crisp and clever, natural sounding, character-revealing, and engaging, at least in the earlier shorts.\n\nThe lead actors Riccardo Scamarcio and Valerio Mastandrea, who play multiple roles in the collection of shorts, are also a treat. It was fun to see them act out the nuances of each of their characters in the different stories.\n\nCaveat: This is a take at men behaving badly, but since comic relief is not enough to disguise the mysogyny in this #metoo age, it kind of feels that the anthology hasn't really got the balls to call a spade a spade.\n\n#theplayers\n#menbehavingbadly\n#comedy\n#italian\n#netflix \n#quarantinejournal\n#lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":11,"Hashtags":["#metoo","#theplayers","#menbehavingbadly","#comedy","#italian","#netflix","#quarantinejournal","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by AA Patawaran in Manila, Philippines.

I am a product of it and now I work actively to make it better. However, my heart goes out to the little ones who are struggling to fit into the requirements of rote learning even in progressive boards. I cannot even begin to think about the plight of students in state and other boards. \n \nA 5 year old is expected to write paragraphs and learn long spellings. A kid who is fairly smart when it comes to making sense of the world around her, telling stories and art & craft breaks down completely when she is made to write. Then she is told she is not writing \u2018beautifully\u2019 or her spellings are wrong. A mother who recognizes her child\u2019s very many gifts gives into the peer pressure and scolds her for \u2018not trying enough\u2019. Even as these words leave her mouth she knows how unfair she is being and chides herself ever so often to let the little one be. \n.\nWhy can\u2019t we make unstructured play a part of the learning process even when kids proceed to senior classes? How can a student grow up suddenly in a matter of weeks just because they have moved from \u201Cpre-school\u201D to \u201Cprimary\u201D school? Why are we so hell bent on factory producing the skill sets of our kids? How difficult is it to bring personalized education in the classroom? \n \nAs a parent and an educator I ponder on these points quite often. Many times I give in to the pressure and expect my kid to toe the line. Other times sense prevails and I let her be.  Schools are not going to change anytime soon as much as we hope. What we can change is our attitude towards learning.\n \nAfter all Gen- Alpha (as kids of millennial parents are referred to) will go on to do jobs that don\u2019t even exist yet and with AI in it's full bloom. Why then do we continue to teach them the way we taught a decade ago?\n.\n.\nIy is wearing zero power computer glasses\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#tobecontinued #weekendrant #littleone #indianeducationsystem #primaryeducation #ahmedabad #ahmedabadblogger #homeschooling #lockdowndiaries #learningbydoing #screentime #onlineschool","NumberOfLikes":1257,"Hashtags":["#tobecontinued","#weekendrant","#littleone","#indianeducationsystem","#primaryeducation","#ahmedabad","#ahmedabadblogger","#homeschooling","#lockdowndiaries","#learningbydoing","#screentime","#onlineschool"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Juhi Bansal in Ahmedabad, India with @kidsstoppress, @worldofmoms, @momspresso, @tweakindia, and @workingmomsofahmedabad.

The wide expanse that opened out before the heights on which the Russian batteries stood guarding the bridge, was at times veiled by a diaphanous curtain of slanting rain, and then, suddenly spread out in the sunlight, far-distant objects could be clearly seen glittering as though freshly varnished. Down below, the little town could be seen with its white, red-roofed houses, its cathedral, and its bridge, on both sides of which streamed jostling masses of Russian troops. At the bend of the Danube, vessels, an island, and a castle with a park surrounded by the waters of the confluence of the Enns and the Danube, became visible, and the rocky left bank of the Danube covered with pine forests, with a mystic background of green tree-tops and bluish gorges. The turrets of a convent stood out beyond a wild virgin pine-forest, and far away on the other side of the Enns the enemy\u2019s horse patrols could be discerned.\"\nWar and Peace, Tolstoy.\n\n####\n\nPeace is ambiguous, peace is fleeting, peace is elusive.\nAmidst the chaos, I dared to start this epic (yeah, being highly optimistic, you say), and it's been a while. Things do not move. Planning is pointless, when your plan is not time's plan. So plan all you want but, things remain static. You try your best to find a seclusive moment, and just when you get the time, you realize - its not the chores or the people or the events that are distracting you, its rather you, yourself. No pressure, but that seems to be the crux of it.\n\nLong story short, I wanted to read, but wanted to sketch this beautifully narrated scene. Of course, what came to my mind is different than what I painted, but in either case, this was done. \n\nUsed two of the pigment pens (or whatever these are called), with my son's ink (looks like cobalt blue) and a pinch of burnt sienna, that I decided to include at the last moment.\n\n#peace #monochrome #monologue #tolstoy #warandpeace #danube #blue #burntsienna #2020 #artistsoninstagram #artlovers #lockdowndiaries #monochromestudies","NumberOfLikes":141,"Hashtags":["#peace","#monochrome","#monologue","#tolstoy","#warandpeace","#danube","#blue","#burntsienna","#2020","#artistsoninstagram","#artlovers","#lockdowndiaries","#monochromestudies"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":16,"Timestamp":1595049334,"LocalDate":"Sat Jul 18 07:15:34 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"We\u2019ve all been guilty\u2026 But at least you had a reason!
