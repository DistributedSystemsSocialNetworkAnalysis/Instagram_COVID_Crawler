Every case, she explains, has to have a beginning and an end. What she is doing in the area is known as \u2018outbreak investigation\u2019 in epidemiological language.\n\nEchoing Dr Rani\u2019s thoughts is V Santha, the District Collector of Perambalur (second photo). Perambalur is a district in central Tamil Nadu with a population exceeding six lakhs. \n\n\u201CThe effort is to tie up all the loose ends through a three-step process of continuous sampling, contact tracing and containing,\u201D says Santha. There have been instances where people resisted the processes and the district collector had to get herself involved. But how complicated can typing up \u2018loose ends\u2019 be? \n\nOne such baffling case was of college student Venkatakrishnan, who tested positive for COVID 19, however, a source wasn't identified. Given his less than forthcoming attitude, it was getting harder for the administration and team to track the virus. This forced them to shut everything down for fear of community transmission. \n\nVenkatakrishnan had five siblings, and his father was a watchman at a milk parlour. All his family members and everybody at the parlour was tested. The team gathered his call records, checked CCTV footage of places he frequented, however the contact tracing wasn't amounting to a solid breakthrough. \n\nEventually, a source revealed that a foreign returnee named Syed Haneefa had stayed with Venkatakrishnan. He stayed close to the patient, and on digging call records further, they were able to zero in on a man named David. Turns out, Haneefa is Venkatakrishnan's uncle, converted to Muslim, and had stayed with him for three days. Additionally, David was Venkatakrishnan's post-Pentecost convert buddy, with whom he undertook a bike trip to Chennai for a pastor's funeral.","NumberOfLikes":663,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1594914570,"LocalDate":"Thu Jul 16 17:49:30 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Mornings, Old clothes, My haunts and a bit of greenery in this urban jungle!\n#lockdowndiaries #2020","NumberOfLikes":39,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Debika Banerji in Alipore.

What life? Life does not exist without a possessive epithet. Lenin's life differs from, say, James Joyce's as much as a handful of gravel does from a blue diamond... Or take the destinies of Oscar Wilde and Lewis Carroll -- one flaunting a flamboyant perversion and getting caught, and the other hiding his humble but much more evil little secret behind the emulsions of the developing-room, and ending up being the greatest children's story writer of all time... Your term \"life\" is used in a sense which I cannot apply to a manifold shimmer... You must be confusing me with Dostoevski.\n\nPortrait: Fine Art America\n\n#bedtimestory \n#bedsidereading\n#vladimirnabokov\n#nabokov\n#quarantinejournal \n#lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":13,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by AA Patawaran in Manila, Philippines.

When it all began, our country wasn\u2019t that effected and much like others, we took that as a comforting factor and hoped that things will be better soon. \n\nToday, the situation has worsened. We feel anxiety everyday at uncertainty of the future. We feel sad at the pathetic state of world affairs. We feel angry at the arrogance of folks who consider themselves invincible. We miss our family and friends. It hurts that despite being in the same city, we cannot meet our loved ones.\n\nIf you\u2019re reading this, we know you too have felt the same or are still feeling it everyday. But you know what, you\u2019re here right now on this platform and so are we. We\u2019re still looking to connect with each other. Despite our emotional struggles, there\u2019s a time in the day when you, us and many others are either creating great content and\/or appreciating each other. We overcome our feelings of anxiety and sadness, and create\/share a lot of positivity. That my friends is what HOPE does to us.\n\nA hope that this time will pass soon. \nA hope that our lives will be better than what\u2019s now and especially what was before.\nA hope that this world will soon be the place it was meant to be - a happy place to live in. \n\nPic: Gili Trawangan, Indonesia\nShot on : Nikon 3500\n#indonesia #thatindiancouple #lockdowndiaries #beautifuldestinations #travelphotography #islandlife #travelbloggers #coupletravels #traveltogether #exploreindonesia #worldtravel #indiantravellers #indiantravelblogger #travelingcouples #beachvibes #islandvibes #indonesiabucketlist #travelgoals #giliislands #travelogue #southeastasia #cntravel #freedom #lovefortravel #travelthroughtheworld #balilife #nikonphotography #photography #travellersofindia","NumberOfLikes":748,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Tamshuk & Ruzin in Gili Trawangan with @natgeotravel, @cntraveler, @indtravel, @travelandleisure, @beautifuldestinations, @ruzinvakharia, @lonelyplanetindia, @travelandleisureindia, @natgeoyourshot, @nikonindiaofficial, @nikonasia, @delux.e24, @trave.lthe_world, and @nomadtravelcommunity.

A parent can calm a toddler in a tantrum almost instantly by hugging them.\n\nWhen a child\u2019s body is flooded with stress hormones during a tantrum, the most effective way to clam them down is by hugging them or applying positive touch on the bodies, such as holding hands or rubbing their backs.\n\nUnfortunately, most parents resist this idea. The most common reason is that \u201Chugging is rewarding bad behavior.\u201D\n\nHumans are not born with the ability to self-regulate. When we\u2019re young, we rely on our parents to regulate our bodies and to model how to do it. Therefore, withholding hugs to punish a child doesn\u2019t serve the purpose.\n\n#indianmom #indianparents #parentingtip","NumberOfLikes":999,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Diana Monty | india on July 15, 2020 tagging @crocsindia, @pampersindia, @firstcryindia, @babiesvilla, @meemeein, @babiesindiaofficial, @johnsonsbabyindia, @himalaya.babycare, @babies.enthusiasts, @skiphopindia, and @babies.indiaa.

I actually recorded this video about two months ago, but couldn\u2019t deal with the editing process as I had other pressing matters to attend to haha! This is not to say this was not important, I just had to rearrange my priorities that\u2019s all 😌. \n\nMain points to take from this recording:\n\nBe comfortable with being uncomfortable. Don\u2019t avoid uncomfortable situations or conversations just to maintain your comfort. It\u2019s only the people who are willing to be uncomfortable that will go far in life. Comfort breeds complacency! \n\nAlways ask questions, even when it seems dumb or unwise! Asking questions (especially the right ones) helps you gain insight and understanding, and when you have that, anything you do you will always do it better, and with confidence because you comprehend the task in hand. Never shy away from being inquisitive.\n\nStop wasting your time chasing field mice, or else you will starve - but rather, have the patience, strength and endurance to hunt after antelope! A lion that feeds on field mice will soon starve to death, but a lion that hunts after antelope provides a feast for itself and the pride. Chase after bigger things and don\u2019t waste your energy and time on insignificant things.\n\nThere is a bonus point in there too, so I\u2019ll let you watch the video to see what the bonus point is 😉.\n\n#ToolsofTitans #TimFerris #BuildingMyselfUp #LockdownDiaries #Reading #FavouriteBooks #SelfEducation #WisdomInBooks #Wisdom #Books #Education #Success #Winning #Library #BookCollection","NumberOfLikes":33,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1594815025,"LocalDate":"Wed Jul 15 14:10:25 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Mere Liye Tum Kaafi Ho ❤️💃\n.\n.\n.\nStay !! \n.\n.\n@dance.chronicles @pune_dancers @dance.rtee @bollyshake\n#mereliyetumkaafiho #dancevideo #dancepractice #dancelove #love #art #lockdowndiaries #stayhome #funtime #dancecover #keeplearning #exploring #unreel #feelings #lovesongs❤️ #express #random #tunein #feelitstill","NumberOfLikes":254,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":34,"Timestamp":1594814910,"LocalDate":"Wed Jul 15 14:08:30 CEST 2020","Location":"Online"},{"CaptionText":"VEG HAKKA NOODLES 🍜\n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n#quarantinelife#quarantinekitchen#lockdowndiaries#lockdowncooking#foodiesofbhubaneswar#foodbloggers#foodie#foodstagram#foodphotography#foodstylist#foodies#tastyfood#tasty#homemade#foodiesofbalasore","NumberOfLikes":87,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by dish a day in Balasore with @arpitamandal_, @ameodias, @chamber_of_food, and @foody.champ.

I have been feeling so burnt out at work that I am operating at 50% efficiency the last two days. I am delaying writing two line emails and twenty page documents, alike. I am on social media in the daytime doing silly things, scrolling mindlessly, making jokes. No that's not me.\n\nBut I love my work, I thought. This is a busy, awesome season for my work. Lots of launches in progress. And also then there's the entire internet telling me to hustle and be productive (all with good intentions, how I consume the content is on me and not on the creator). Anyway, I am at home, so what will I do with the day off if I take it.\n\nThe answer is, nothing. Sleep, stay away from laptop, eat good food, get an intense workout in, and not feel guilty. Not sure why I am burnt out, but that's not the point. We are dealing with difficult, scary news everyday. We do housework and regular work. We haven't been able to make plans. We haven't seen family in a long time. It's okay for these things to affect me. It does not mean I don't care about my dreams or career or responsibilities. It doesn't make me weak or lazy or someone who is blind to the opportunities of this lockdown. It makes me, me. A vulnerable person who is having a tough time dealing with this and is allowed to rest till I get back to some version of normal.\n\nIf you have felt anything like me at all, please know that it's more common than ever before. And it's okay for you to take a break and not feel guilty about it. A little bit of self compassion please. If you're able to do a lot in these times, you are an amazing person and I am proud of you. If you are just able to manage life one day at a time and somedays not even that, you are still amazing and I am still proud of you.

All I can think about is when I'm going to be able to start another round of IVF and I'm not sure I have the energy to deal with anything else. I don't want to talk to people about what I'm doing, have to explain what's wrong with me or why I have to keep having time off. I've been exhausted and in pain alot of time through this cycle and I'm aware I've been very lucky not to have to work this time. I was finding one of my jobs very stressful and felt I was at a crossroads with it prior to lockdown, I can't afford to leave and not knowing what the future holds makes it hard to try and make career changes right now. On top of that I work in a very social space dealing with a lot of people - one of the reasons I used to love my job - but I've been on my own for so long now being social freaks me out a little bit! I've definitely forgotten how to be around people. I love my personal training and the thought of a few hours a week doing that would be lovely but sadly I can't afford to do just that... So today I've mostly been in denial, napping and trying not to get too anxious about everything!!

Literally. We either sing triumphs or go on sharing tales of heartbreaks. It's either about wanting to fall in love or terribly running away from it. How strange is it? That we have made love about another person; when infact we can never truly love the other without first loving ourselves. How strange is that, when you talk about love you never talk about yourself.\n\nSelf love is deeper than the pamper sessions at salons\/shopping malls, or night outs with friends. It's a process. It's a choice. Conscious effort. To get up early because you have a long day ahead. To maintain distance from the people who hamper your mental health. To eat your greens. To choose your happiness over & over. To be kind to yourself. To forgive yourself for all the things that went wrong. To allow yourself to rest. To fail. But, at the same time to remind yourself to keep going.To learn to say 'No'. To never fall out of love with yourself while falling in love with someone else. To better yourself for nobody else but you. And, to be perfectly okay with where ever you are right now. To keep repeating all this & more. To love yourself because you simply can & not because it's told to. 🎈\n\nTag a friend & remind them of this. \nFollow @ifeeliwritesite for more 💫","NumberOfLikes":111,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":23,"Timestamp":1594739161,"LocalDate":"Tue Jul 14 17:06:01 CEST 2020","Location":"*caption"},{"CaptionText":"I know how sometimes you do a perfect face but the hair just ruins it.

Complying with the regulations of multiple authorities (that's India for you) is one hell of a job, but Nitesh manages it all with his customary calm. When necessary you will find him at his desk even on weekends to ensure that all paperwork is complete and compliant. \nNitesh may not speak unless spoken to, (perhaps twice before you can elicit a response), but without him the company's smooth operations would be severely impaired. \nWith a constant eye on the figures, it is Nitesh's efforts that keep the liquidity of the company on an even keel - an absolute necessity in the exhibition services business. His devotion to his work has also helped  build the company's excellent reputation among vendors and suppliers. \n#messebau #messe #messebauer#tradefairstands#boothbuilder #boothdesigner #boothdesigners #stalldesign #boothdesign #stallbuilder #exhibition #exhibitionstanddesigners #Exhibitions2 #exhibitionstall #exhibitionsinindia #exhibitionboothdesigner #tradefair #tradefairstand #stalldesign #standbuilder #stallbuilder #standdesigner #expoprojects #indianexhibition #exhibitionsinindia","NumberOfLikes":19,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by prezens exhibitions India on July 04, 2020 tagging @ajayshindeast, @radhakrishnasatpute, @kiran.kbs1969, @suresh_sagare16, @aarti.mkar, @pravin.prezens2020, and @sharadwaradkar.

Just meet me under the sky somewhere and be alive with me.\n~Victoria Erickson\n.\nI am loving this quote right now. Perhaps this is what iso is trying to point out to us, just to be alive is the gift, being alive is the whole point!\n.\nI am taking this time to get back to the really important stuff. Social media will be taking a back burner while I spend these next precious weeks with my family and with people who lift me up, walking, yogaing, reading and learning. How often do we get time like this to truly feel alive.... it shouldn\u2019t just be for holidays or long weekends. Most of us spend our days being busy, rushing, just getting through and most often not being our best selves. But shouldn\u2019t feeling alive and fully present in our lives BE our \u201Cnormal?\u201D\n.\n@jayshetty gives us the 54321 method (steps below) for getting present, and when you combine this with redirecting your energy towards the things that bring you joy, or make you feel good, you WILL begin to feel more alive, more present and more able to lead a purposeful, fulfilling and joyful life. What have you got to lose? What fills you up? For me it time by the sea, running, catching up with friends, warming up by an outdoor fire, feeling sunshine on my skin, or flowing out a yoga practice. What\u2019s on your list? And for fun, try the 54321 method described below, start with a few times a day and then see if you can increase this to every hour. Let\u2019s get present. ☀️\n.\nName 5 things you can see.\nName 4 things you can touch.\nName 3 things you can hear.\nName 2 thing you can smell.\nName 1 thing you can taste.\n.\nThe only time we truly have is now.\n✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨\n.\n#bealive #getpresent #hereandnow #isolationlife #lockdowndiaries #usetimewisely #mindset #purposefulliving #riseup","NumberOfLikes":19,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Lindsey Brittlebank on July 13, 2020.

Terzani\n\/\u2063\n\u2063\nIl lockdown del 2020 ci ha risucchiati improvvisamente ognuno nella propria scatola solo apparentemente familiare per amore e a tutela della sopravvivenza della specie, rinchiusi a subire la stessa lenta violenza a cui si rassegna un detenuto. Forse più vicina ad una serie infinita di tag che ad uno strutturato discorso, ci ha costretti a vivere dentro un loop infinito. ha svuotato le nostre ore dalla frenesia e l'ossessione dell'uomo moderno di fare tutto in poco tempo. Superato quell'iniziale senso di vuoto, ho cominciato ad apprezzarne i vantaggi, a cogliere il dono prezioso del tempo che mi era stato concesso, e spinta dalle parole di Terzani, mi sono sottratta al soffocante ritmo della società moderna, alimentando passioni e nutrendo la mente.\u2063 Lockdown é uno spaccato della sofferente estraneazione della prima fase, il racconto che ne ho fatto, l'acerbo frutto della seconda.\u2063\n\u2063\n\/\u2063\n\u2063\nThe 2020 lockdown suddenly sucked us all into their own apparently familiar box for love and to protect the survival of the species, locked up to suffer the same slow violence that a prisoner resigns himself to.  Perhaps closer to an infinite series of tags than to a structured discourse, it forced us to live in an infinite loop.  It has emptied our hours from the frenzy and the obsession of modern man to do everything in a short time.  Having overcome that initial sense of emptiness, I began to appreciate its advantages, to grasp the precious gift of time that had been granted to me, and driven by Terzani's words, I withdrew from the suffocating rhythm of modern society, fueling passions and nourishing  mind.\u2063 Lockdown is a cross-section of the suffering estrangement of the first phase, the story I made of it, the bitter fruit of the second.","NumberOfLikes":33,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1594666464,"LocalDate":"Mon Jul 13 20:54:24 CEST 2020","Location":"Everywhere"},{"CaptionText":"#lockdowndiaries \n#A day out to office.\n#refreshing","NumberOfLikes":42,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Shub_Raees@ in Bangalore, India.

I call this the 'Rainbow salad with a Sunshine dressing'! I love how colorful and vibrant this salad is and it is a 100% NOT boring 🙌 This salad is packed with protein, healthy carbs and tons of veggies and will definitely fill you up.\n\nStep 1: Wash and dry kale leaves and tear them into bite size pieces. Massage the kale \nusing your hands for 2-3 minutes after adding a bit of extra virgin olive oil, salt and pepper. This helps kale fibers break down.\nStep 2: Fill your salad bowl with the massaged kale, cooked quinoa, veggies of your choice (I used sweet corn, shredded carrots and purple cabbage), protein of your choice (I added veggie sausages) and sliced almonds (optional)\nStep 3: Pour over your dressing, mix everything together and enjoy! \n\nThis salad is great for meal prep too since the veggies used don't get soggy. Store the dressing seperately and mix right before eating!\n\nDressing recipe:\nMix together 1 tablespoon almond butter, juice from half lemon, 1\/2 teaspoon turmeric powder, a tiny piece of grated ginger, some honey, salt, freshly cracked black pepper and thin it out with a little water to make a pourable dressing. Change up the amount of honey depending on your taste. You can also add 1\/2 teaspoon of my curry powder (recipe on my IGTV) if you like things a little spicy.\n\nWhat did you have for lunch today?\n\nIf you do try this recipe, post it on social media and tag me or use #limethymerecipes\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#indianfoodie #indianfoodbloggers #feedfeed #foodart #easydessert #food365 #refreshing #delicious #tasty #staysafekeepcooking #Buzzfeast #TODAYbreakfast #quarantinecooking #lockdowndiaries #rainbowsalad #veganrecipes #healthysald #notboringsalad #colorfulfood #eatyourveggies #turmericdressing #easysaladrecipe #veganbuddhabowl #buddhabowl #summerrecipes #mealprep #f52grams #vegansalad #indiansalad\n@todayfood @thefeedfeed @foodandwine @foodtalkindia @foodandwine @thrivemagazine @thrivemags @bonappetitmag @bbcgoodfood @beautifulcuisines  @food52 @buzzfeedfood @hautescuisines @theindianroute @walkwithindia @desi.diaries @indiatimesinsta","NumberOfLikes":74,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Viola Gomes | Lime Thyme in Seattle, Washington.

Someone I admire, I adore and I love. Yes I said those words... I love. For love is the admiration of a person, their beauty, their strength, their weakness, their energy & their incredible being! This girl is one of the most inspiring, wonderful and powerful people I have ever loved, adore and lucky to have in my life! People talk about couple goals as in finding someone who has the same fitness beliefs but to me this person is my worry, my rock, my stance, my care, my illness and my heart!

If I ask you to name the one thing that gives you chills, that instils a sense of fear in you, what would that be?\n\n \n\nMost of us have a hard time accepting that anything ever scares us. Mainly because fearlessness has been traditionally seen as a sign of strength. It\u2019s taken as a positive attribute. No one can be completely free from fear. It\u2019s a human emotion, like happiness, sadness, anger, grief, and others, fear forms a part of the family too. So how appropriate is our response to being asked if we are fearless? Or is the question in itself is inappropriate?\n\n \n\nIf you look back, we as a species have evolved only because we feared. We modified our coping mechanisms to deal with the changing exteriors. It\u2019s only because we accepted our fears, we chose to face them, and once we did, we figured our way out! Fear is what kept us alive, fear is what encouraged us to act out of the ordinary in extraordinary circumstances. So, if fear is one of the main reasons behind our existence, I wonder if the question should rather be, how fearful are you? Fearlessness is nothing but a degree of fearfulness in each one of us, it sure can vary from person to person, but it does exist in all of us!\nContinued in comments... \n\n#Day22 #lockdowndiaries #lockdownlearnings #lockdown #pandemic #corona #thistooshalpass #staysafe #stayindoors #bevigilant #fear #life #instadaily #takeresponsibility #fightback #evolve #shividoodle #doodle #writing #lovewriting #lovemore #onceawriteralwaysawriter #doodlethoughts #notexactlyrandomthoughts #newnormal","NumberOfLikes":32,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Shividoodle in Bangalore, India.

We know it. It's rocked the world over. Some days you may find yourself asking, \"When will things go back to normal?\" The loss of a sense of community and routine is irreplaceable, but that doesn't mean we have lost our ability to adapt.

Acceptance here doesn't mean giving in. On the contrary, it means that accepting the fact that things have changed, and instead of resisting, we let it flow over us and change ourselves according to it. It means that we take walks around the space in our house instead of going out, be our own baristas instead of ordering out, start-up a food blog instead of trying new restaurants. These \"new\" habits will take time to form, but when they're a part of your life, you will feel more in tune with yourself and in control of what is happening around you. \n.\n🔅𝔦𝔱'𝔰 𝔬𝔨𝔞𝔶 𝔱𝔬 𝔣𝔢𝔢𝔩 𝔲𝔭𝔰𝔢𝔱 𝔴𝔥𝔢𝔫 𝔱𝔥𝔦𝔫𝔤𝔰 𝔡𝔬𝔫'𝔱 𝔴𝔬𝔯𝔨 𝔬𝔲𝔱🔅\nIt's okay to feel negative. They are valid feelings. But do try to understand, if these responses are necessary for the event or if you need to shift your thoughts. Making time for yourself during the day will reduce any anxious feelings you have. You don't need to follow a rigid schedule. Some days can go good; others may be worse off. As long as there is something to keep you moving along, that is good enough. Lastly, build a strong community presence in your life by staying connected and in touch with people. You don't know how much you need it.

We\u2019ve had literal storms in our lives in the past and gone are some documents and photos & the memories that come with it. \n\nI\u2019ve dug up some photos from my father\u2019s side of the family that I want to share with my DakshayaniShayn. I think it\u2019s important that she knows her roots because family photographs tell a lot of stories. \n\nI\u2019ve come across a term once about using photographs as a means of therapy. It is called phototherapy where people are prompt to talk about family history, stories, events and such. This form of therapy helps people deal with issues from their past and mend relationships in the present. It has been used in groups, couples and families undergoing counseling.\n\nFor me looking at these photos meant discovering things about my family, relationships, and of course myself. It\u2019s therapeutic to look at old photos and be reminded of the good times.\n\nFor weeks now I\u2019ve had these pockets of time shared with someone. There\u2019s an outpouring of emotions and self-expression while we both talked about families and friends who mattered in our lives. It keeps me grounded and more in tune with myself and my loved ones. \n\nWhat\u2019s your favourite moment during this time\/lockdown? It may be a difficult time for you. Whatever it is you are going through try to foster self-belief. Remember that you have what it takes to get through all these. \n\nAre you still trying to figure out how to best connect with the people around you? How about sharing a warm cup of tea or café varraco while rummaging through those photos? 🍵☕️\n\n#historyinpictures #blackandwhite #Teatime #looseTea #blackcoffee #Abellon #Guanzon #roadtoselfcare #lockdowndiaries\n#TitaBarbs @itsmetitabarbs #TitasofCebu #kapengbarako #blackcoffee #halfboiledegg #coffeeandlove","NumberOfLikes":12,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1594579117,"LocalDate":"Sun Jul 12 20:38:37 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Watering the garden before bed.

She has broken many barriers in her long and successful career and has been known as a woman of strong determination, but the journey to where she is right now has not been an easy one. Her rise to fame was accompanied with a lot of grief and loneliness. Ever since she announced her sexuality, she has received a lot of hate and backlash. DeGeneres said, \u201CIt took a while to shake off that judgment and the attacks I felt . . . I was fully honest with myself and that gave me confidence. I think that helps with depression. Depression eats away at your confidence and you get lost in that, and forget that you\u2019re enough just as you are.\u201D She had been forced into the role of a leader and advocate for the LGBT community, but none of this was what she truly desired. All she wanted was freedom and a life of dignity. After moving out of town, she felt more isolated and reluctant to reach out for help. Fortunately, the times change. Ellen finally came out of her shell when people started to recognise her struggle, especially when she received an award from President Obama. Representation for the LGBTQ community is at an all-time high with no signs of slowing down, and its thanks in large part to Ellen\u2019s bravery.\n_\nVisit us at www.cowin.live\n_\n\n#cowin #global #covid19 #who#pandemic #lockdown#globalpandemic #coronavirus#HealthForAll \n#stayhome #staysafe#socialdistancing #safetymeasures#awareness #lockdowndiaries\n#quatantine #homebound#unitednations #technology #tech#TechnologyForGood #techstartup\n#techsolution #instatech #appdesign#healthcare #quarintinelife #canada#globaleconomy #indianeconomy","NumberOfLikes":12,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Collective Win on July 12, 2020.
