But under the substitute rape bill, the woman can also be charged with rape by a man. This is just one of the many drastic amendments in the new rape bill that had just been approved by the House committees on Revision of Laws and Welfare of Children. The new bill overhauls the country\u2019s laws against rape, sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, and other gender-based violence.\n\nAmong the amendments are: the age of statutory rape is set at below 16 with some nuances; forgiveness, subsequent marriage do not erase rape crime; a rape victim may be any person of any gender or gender orientation; lack of consent is presumed; rape definition is expanded to include certain acts of perversion for sexual gratification and sweetheart clause or consensual sex between young sweethearts with provision on allowable age difference.\n\nREAD MORE: https:\/\/opinyon.net\/2020\/08\/27\/house-panels-approve-changes-to-rape-law\/\n\n#housepanel #changes #rapelaw #rape #sexualabuse #sexualexploitation #genderbasedviolence #statutoryrape #childtrafficking  #replawrencefortun #revisionoflawsandwelfareofchildren #reclusionperpetua #pandemic #increasednumber #dswd #opinyon #opinyonnews #wetakeastand","NumberOfLikes":0,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by OpinYon on August 27, 2020.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598578622,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 28 03:37:02 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"For everyone who thinks #phpagency is fake 😒 and not a legitimate company I don't need you in my life.

Pada tahun 1992 Ia mempelajari Historio-grafi di Fakultas Ilmu Budaya di Universitas Negeri Jember. Kemudian mulai tahun 1993 Farhan juga mempelajari seni rupa di Studio Seni Rupa UKM Kesenian Universitas Jember.\nKarya Farhan mulai dipamerkan pada tahun 2000 dalam beberapa pameran bersama. Sebelum memutuskan menjadi seniman, Farhan pernah menggeluti pekerjaan dibidang periklanan, sehingga mempengaruhi pilihan artistik bagi karyanya.\nBergabung dengan \u201CSama-sama Mural Project\u201D (2002) proyek seni publik yang paling penting di Yogyakarta dengan proyek Apotik Komik Yogyakarta dan Clarion Alley Mural dari San Francisco, Farhan kebanyakan dikenal sebagai street artist dan juga aktif dalam pergerakan komik bawah tanah di kota. Sebagian dari lukisan stensilnya memuat merek dagang yang membahas masyarakat kontemporer dan budaya konsumen. Jalur non-linear Farhan ke seni kontemporer menjadi dasar bagi karyanya saat ini. Dalam karyanya\ntidak hanya keterampilan teknis dalam periklanan yang dimunculkan, tetapi juga menginformasikan konten praktik seniman saat ini. \nFarhan saat ini tinggal dan berkarya di Yogyakarta.\n\nPantau terus IG LATAR @latar_art_space untuk menikmati karya-karya seniman Farhan Siki\n____________________\n\nLATAR\nTerbuka untuk umum\nSenin \u2013 Jumat, 09:00 \u2013 15:00 WIB\n(tutup pada hari libur)\n\nBank BTPN Sinaya, Menara BTPN\nGround Floor, CBD Mega Kuningan\nJl.

Your allowed to be sad about the things you\u2019ve missed this year, the wedding that\u2019s been cancelled, the overseas trip, big work opportunity, or your big party.  There are people a lot worse off or had it worse then you this year then just your holiday being cancelled.  But we all cope with disappointments and struggles differently, you need to be able to be sad about what you have lost this year, no matter how \u201Cfrivolous\u201D it was.  A lot of us had things we had been looking forward to for over year only to realise everything is cancelled and out of our control.\n\nSome people can move on and realise there is nothing they can do, others need to be sad and mourn what could have been.  We are all struggling right now with something, we just need to be understanding and be kind to others with whatever they are struggling with, because you never know what they have been going through and dealing with this year.\n\nTell us in the comments what you\u2019ve missed or been sad about this year. \n\nWe\u2019ve had work lost, our first olympics job in Tokyo postponed, our wedding postponed and honeymoon changed.

One of these risk factors is obesity. According to a recent study from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, obesity increases the risk of getting coronavirus, risk of arriving in the hospital and ICU, and risk of death. Additionally, due to a weakened immune system response, a vaccine would be less effective for people who are obeise. UNC researchers concluded that obese people had a 46% higher chance of contracting Covid and a 113% greater risk of landing in the hospital compared to non-obese people. Furthermore, obese people had a 74% increased chance of landing in the ICU and a 48% greater chance of dying compared to non-obese people. These results are very clear: Obesity is a serious risk factor of COVID-19. In order to reduce the risk of a severe case, the CDC advises obese people to take any medications for underlying conditions exactly as prescribed, immediately visit a doctor if symptoms are present, and practice good nutrition and physical activity.

To make matters worse, some politicians think it useful to stoke our fears.\n \nFear is powerful. It works deep in the brain, in a part that dates back to our reptilian ancestors. It is meant to help us survive by helping us fight or flee. Yet today, we fear many things we can\u2019t literally fight or flee.\n \nFear constricts our thinking and narrows our focus. We tend to lose our perception of anything except our fear. Perhaps the best example \u2013 and metaphor \u2013 is sight. Fear focuses us tightly on what is in the center of our field of vision. We ignore the peripheral stuff.\n \nWhen we face immediate danger, this focus is useful for survival. But if we get stuck here, there are problems. For most of life, we need to keep perception open. Without peripheral perception, we have difficulty experiencing peace, love, creativity, intuition \u2013 the qualities we cultivate in spirituality.\n \nWhen fear is triggered, what can we do to open our perception?\n \n1. Recognize fear in our bodies. We can cultivate awareness through mindfulness.\n2. Sit with the feeling without trying to flee from it. Gently investigate it. But if fear becomes overwhelming, it\u2019s fine to distract ourselves for a while.\n3. Take appropriate action. The energy of fear seeks physical release. Sometimes there are things we can do: vote, give, volunteer, protest. Often, though, there is no immediate physical action we can take. Aerobic exercise or mindful movement can offer a surrogate physical release.\n4. Accept what we cannot change. This may require ongoing meditation, prayer or a similar spiritual practice.\n \n\u201CPerfect love casts out fear,\u201D says the Bible (1 Jn 4.18). This is true at a neurological level. We let go of fear as we expand our awareness to take in more of the whole \u2013 to care for others, to snuggle a pet, to tend the soil.\n \nSo, take care of your emotions. Stay mindful of the messages you receive from media and politics. Keep yourself in love as much as you can. We need peace and creativity to face the very real problems before us.\n \n~~~\n \n📸 M. T.

Ia menelurusi fenomena bawah laut di Cenota Angelita, Mexico.\n\nSaat melakukan penyelaman, ia dikejutkan dengan sebuah fenomena alam yang luar biasa. Dia menemukan air tawar di antara air laut yang asin. Penemuan itu membuatnya takjub.  Bagaimana mungkin air tawar bisa berada terpisah dalam air laut yang asin? Tetapi itulah kenyataan yang dia temukan di dalam laut.\n\nRasa ingin tahunya yang besar membuat Costeau kembali menyelam lebih dalam lagi. Ia menyaksikan fenomena alam yang lebih mengejutkan lagi. Betapa tidak. Ia melihat ada sungai di dasar lautan.\n\nSungai di bawah laut itu ditumbuhi daun-daunan dan pohon. Para peneliti menyebut fenomena itu sebagai lapisan Hidrogen Sulfida. Tapi tampak seperti sungai? Yang menjadi tanda tanya par ahli, mengapa air yang mengalir di sungai bawah laut itu rasanya tawar?\n\nSesungguhnya, sekitar 14 abad lalu, Alquran telah menjelaskan fenomena itu.  Simak saja surah Al-Furqan [25] ayat 53: ''Dan Dialah yang membiarkan dua laut mengalir (berdampingan); yang ini tawar dan segar dan yang lain sangat asin lagi pahit; dan Dia Jadikan antara keduanya dinding dan barat yang tidak tembus.''\n\nSumber: Republika.com\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nFollow\n@pertemananshalihat_community\n\nDapatkan tausiyah-tausiyah, inspirasi dan tips seputar  muslimah dan rumahtangga di @pertemananshalihat_community\n\nBagi yang ingin tergabung, mengikuti KULWAP\/KULGRAM rutin & grstis seputar tema keluarga dan pernikahan silahkan kontak\nWA 0813-4423-1992 🙏\n\n#pertemananshalihat\n#pertemananshalihatcommunity\n#pertemananshalihatquotes \n#tausiyahnikah\n#hijrah\n#quotesislami\n#motivasi\n#nasehatislami\n#katamutiara\n#kajianislam\n#kajianbandung\n#kajianparentingbandung\n#Kajiankeluarga\n#kajiankeluargabandung\n#pernikahan\n#inspirasi\n#quoteoftheday\n#fiqihwanita\n#dakwah\n#tausiyah\n#tausiyahhariini \n#tipsrumahtangga \n#videoislami \n#resepmasakanrumahan \n#pernikahannewnormal\n#resepsinewnormal\n#dirumahaja \n#pandemic \n#quarantinelife \n#karantina","NumberOfLikes":1,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by 🧡PertemananShalihat Community🧡 on August 27, 2020.

Please follow the guidelines and remember that not everyone has a safe space to return to.\nWhen universities close, many students can enter resource-limited or stressful domestic situations. Students may return to multi-generational homes, where maintaining boundaries may be a challenge. Students with certain characteristics may be disproportionately impacted.\nFor example,students with low socioeconomic status may have inadequate housing options, limited access to high-speed internet, and be pressured to work.Symptoms of mental health conditions have been high in college student populations since before the start of the pandemic. But relative to fall 2019, the prevalence of depression increased while substance use decreased in spring 2020. And compared to the previous year, in March to May 2020 a higher proportion of students reported that their mental health negatively impacted their academic performance.\n\n So please:\n\nWear face coverings at all times in campus buildings, outdoors when they cannot social distance from others, and wherever state or local laws require.\n\nHonor physical distancing requirements on and off campus.\n\nFollow good hand hygiene practices.\n\nStay home and seek medical care if you are ill.\n\nDon't be responsible for shutting down fall semester. \n\n#students #college #university #covid #covid19 #safe #staysafe #guidelines #coronavirus #pandemic #2020 #fallsemester #popular #instagram #follow #like #love #trending #instagood","NumberOfLikes":136,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598566023,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 28 00:07:03 CEST 2020","Location":"New York, New York"},{"CaptionText":"Ready for more?

She will have telling memories of Mum coming home from work with stories of how this pandemic is affecting people on a multitude of levels. Some of those memories wont be very happy, she will recall times where her Mum was at something similar to a breaking point, existing in a space between...displacement and fear. She will be able to attest to the fact that \u2018giving up\u2019 is never an option. Even when you feel like none of the directions work for you, you keep moving. You work towards something, sometimes anything...sometimes easing peoples fear of Covid because you\u2019ve seen it...a lot. Sometimes comforting family and being supportive of friends and coworkers. Sometimes it means going into the unknown with a paper mask and foggy goggles, just hoping for the best.

Over the last six months, many have applied their energies and imaginations to various virtual initiatives that, in no uncertain terms, pave the way to what could become standard across the #performingarts - equally-weighted live and #virtual programming running side by side. The @santafeopera\u2019s General Director Robert K. Meya said as much in a recent Associated Press article, highlighting the company\u2019s well-received #SongsfromSantaFe virtual opening nights. \n\nTwo singers who\u2019ve taken up this digital \/ virtual challenge are soprano #EmilyMisch and bass #WillMeinert. Based in Herndon, Virginia, Emily was set to be a @glimmerglassfestival young artist this summer, while Will was scheduled for his second season as a #SantaFeOpera apprentice artist. As their summers and lives changed, they began executing an ambitious plan. The results thus far are impressive; as of this writing, the @PareaSeries format appears to be the only one of its kind online. Viewers are treated to wonderful, longer form #recitals with expert guest conversation around a given topic. Parea\u2019s shorter form Instagram promotional videos also deliver maximum interest - and punch - at around three minutes.

He was bummed at first, but after I explained the concept of zoom and the advantages of more time with mom, dad and nana (depending on the day) he responded with \u201Cthat sounds SUH-weet!!\u201D Now that we know our plan, I ordered him a desk & chair for his room and finally took him school supply shopping. I\u2019m not actually sure if he still needs this stuff, but school is a week and a half away and the school has still given us zero updates so I bought it. I also bought him some organizational items and teaching aids for his learning area.

What a year 2020 has been so far! I am just grateful for another day to live, breathe, move and have my being! I know you are too! As I am just coming off of a long and much needed social media break I can't help but feel immense gratitude and love for the authentic and heartfelt relationships that I have attracted over the last couple of years. (I love my yogi tribe!) Going through a pandemic and social unrest has a way of helping you appreciate and understand the power of authentic connections on another level!⠀\n⠀\nThis video clip brings back great memories from a Ritual Hot Yoga retreat that I attended in 2019. It was perfect timing as I was at a point in my life of intentionally creating and maintaining radical self care rituals. My healing journey has taught me and led me to make radical self-care my top priority. My self-care is over everything! Making this decision has changed my life for the better and I will never turn back. ⠀\n⠀\nWhen you decide to take care of yourself in a radical way, you must understand that your relationships and who you choose to connect with matters in a really big way. You must CHOOSE you first by deciding that your life is sacred, your heart is sacred and your energy is sacred. Remove yourself from anyone who demeans, disregards, disrespects or denies you! Deem yourself worthy of love and respect and watch how the universe lines up people in your path who can demonstrate it in your life.⠀\n⠀\nRadical self-care is a main pillar in my coaching program! Those who embrace this methodology begin to see their lives shift in a huge way! If you'd like to join me or find out more, reach out and let's chat. I'd love to hear from you.⠀\nhttps:\/\/bit.ly\/2STJ7te #radicalselfcare #selflove #hrrmethod #holistichealing #mindbodyspirit #divineconnections #ritualhotyoga #yoga #tbt #holistichealthcoach #onlinecoaching #pandemic #relationshipmatters #authentic","NumberOfLikes":28,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1598558191,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 27 21:56:31 CEST 2020","Location":"Eluthera Bahamas"},{"CaptionText":"#Knightsbridge at rush hour 😳 How times have changed 😢 #covid19 #pandemic #socialdistancing #tube","NumberOfLikes":1,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by mrs.knightsbridge in Knightsbridge, London, UK.

There may be only one open entrance and in most centres, only one parent or caregiver will be allowed to come in with the child.⠀\n⠀\n3️\u20E3 Hospital staff will look different. They will be wearing personal protective equipment, such as masks, gowns, eye shields, and gloves. ⠀\n⠀\n4️\u20E3 Sanitize your hands when you arrive. Use the hand sanitizer stations for you and your child in the ED waiting room. You and your child may also be given a mask \u2013 keep this on during your entire visit and try not to touch your face or your child\u2019s face. ⠀\n⠀\nCheck out our interactive infographic (link in bio) for more information related to visiting the ED during COVID-19.

Tiene efecto desbridante del tejido necrótico y aporta oxígeno🍃 en heridas anaerobias. Además, por su acción oxidante, es desodorizante👃. Se inactiva⏹️ frente a materia orgánica.\n\n- Alcohol 70%: Bactericida. Usado como antiséptico previo a inyecciones💉 o extracciones. No debe usarse en heridas🤕, ya que tiene efecto irritativo y puede formar un coágulo que protege las bacterias supervivientes. Se inactiva⏹️ frente a materia orgánica.\n\n- Clorhexidina: Bactericida de amplio espectro. No es irritante y carece de reacciones sistémicas ya que su absorción es nula🚫. Su actividad se ve poco interferida por la presencia de materia orgánica▶️. Puede usarse en embarazadas🤰, neonatos👶 (cordón umbilical) y lactantes🤱.\n\n-Povidona yodada: Bactericida. Se inactiva⏹️ en contacto con materia orgánica. Es citotóxica⚠️. En uso sistemático, se ha descrito disfunción renal y tiroidea. Inactiva⏹️ a desbridantes enzimáticos como la colagenasa.\n\n¡Espero haberos ayudado y que os haya gustado!\n\n¡Si es así, agradezco vuestro LIKE👍 y que COMPARTÁIS!\n.\n.\n#enfermeriavisible #enfermeria #nursing #enfermera #medicine #nurse #salud #auxiliardeenfermeria\n#ebe #aprendizaje #tcae #enfermero #españa #enfermeros #medicos #quedateencasa #doctor #medico #nurselife #urgencias #antiseptico #clinica #cuarentena  #pandemic #cura #emergencias #aprender #evidencias #dato","NumberOfLikes":29,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598551211,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 27 20:00:11 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Onam connona \n\n#quarantinedays #pandemic #vfx #vfxartist \n#graphics #covid19","NumberOfLikes":8,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598551114,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 27 19:58:34 CEST 2020","Location":"KIMSHealth Trivandrum"},{"CaptionText":"Po usunięciu drugiej z czterech ósemek.

The mandatory shutdown caused business owners and staff members to lose a significant amount of income. Unfortunately, this great loss in the job market caused the inequality gap to increase between minorities and non-racialized groups. However, the inequality impact is more significant than just racialized groups. The gender pay gap has also dramatically increased and reversed the progress of establishing equality in the workforce. This might be due to working moms reducing their work hours to accommodate for the greater responsibilities at home. With all these implications, mental health has become a significant challenge for many. Click on our link below learn more about our insights on all these issues!

The performance bags my face and in so doing ironically uncovers what we are not supposed to talk about during the pandemic, the side effects. The side effects to cover one's face are the loss of identity, autonomy, freedom of expression, voice, and oxygen, and the onset of feelings of isolation, degradation, dehumanization, disconnection from other people, where one becomes a nameless, faceless person sitting isolated in their own depression. \n\nRates of depression and suicide have increased dramatically.
