Such gratitude for being able to live in this beautiful place. \n\nGratitude as well for the last several years that I've spent in therapy since leaving my marriage of almost 20 years. I'm reminded regularly that learning to be healthy is work. Establishing healthy boundaries and expectations is hard work. The downside of getting married at 18 and again at 24, is that I've had to learn and work at being in relationship with others as an adult. Both romantically and platonically, as well as learning to be in relationship with myself. Which has been the hardest. Our culture doesn't do a great job at preparing us to be comfortable with ourselves. \n\nI was just chatting with a pal, and it hit me that I've become quite comfortable with myself in a way that I never could have imagined. \n\nTurns out that tending to our emotional, mental and spiritual well being is the most important #Selfcare that we can engage in. It's not as sexy as a good pedicure, massage or retail therapy, but tending to our essential well being is what grounds us for the trials of life. \n\nHaving that revelation, while taking in this view is indeed a gift. #grownladyshit #growingup #midlifemusings #middleage #healing #healthychanges #soulwork #coviving #pandemic #pandemicmusings #lifeduringcovid19 #coronavirusdiarys #maineislandlife #maineislands #bgimchronicles #blackwomenwellness #mentalhealth","NumberOfLikes":169,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Black Girl in Maine on August 27, 2020.

To make matters worse, some politicians think it useful to stoke our fears.\n \nFear is powerful. It works deep in the brain, in a part that dates back to our reptilian ancestors. It is meant to help us survive by helping us fight or flee. Yet today, we fear many things we can\u2019t literally fight or flee.\n \nFear constricts our thinking and narrows our focus. We tend to lose our perception of anything except our fear. Perhaps the best example \u2013 and metaphor \u2013 is sight. Fear focuses us tightly on what is in the center of our field of vision. We ignore the peripheral stuff.\n \nWhen we face immediate danger, this focus is useful for survival. But if we get stuck here, there are problems. For most of life, we need to keep perception open. Without peripheral perception, we have difficulty experiencing peace, love, creativity, intuition \u2013 the qualities we cultivate in spirituality.\n \nWhen fear is triggered, what can we do to open our perception?\n \n1. Recognize fear in our bodies. We can cultivate awareness through mindfulness.\n2. Sit with the feeling without trying to flee from it. Gently investigate it. But if fear becomes overwhelming, it\u2019s fine to distract ourselves for a while.\n3. Take appropriate action. The energy of fear seeks physical release. Sometimes there are things we can do: vote, give, volunteer, protest. Often, though, there is no immediate physical action we can take. Aerobic exercise or mindful movement can offer a surrogate physical release.\n4. Accept what we cannot change. This may require ongoing meditation, prayer or a similar spiritual practice.\n \n\u201CPerfect love casts out fear,\u201D says the Bible (1 Jn 4.18). This is true at a neurological level. We let go of fear as we expand our awareness to take in more of the whole \u2013 to care for others, to snuggle a pet, to tend the soil.\n \nSo, take care of your emotions. Stay mindful of the messages you receive from media and politics. Keep yourself in love as much as you can. We need peace and creativity to face the very real problems before us.\n \n~~~\n \n📸 M. T. ElGassier (Unsplash).","NumberOfLikes":6,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by David Gormong\u2022Spiritual Guide on August 27, 2020.

I got it. Why don't we nuke them?\" according to one source who was there. \"They start forming off the coast of Africa, as they're moving across the Atlantic, we drop a bomb inside the eye of the hurricane and it disrupts it. Why can't we do that?\" the source added, paraphrasing the president's remarks.\nThe briefer \"was knocked back on his heels,\" the source in the room added. \"You could hear a gnat fart in that meeting. People were astonished. After the meeting ended, we thought, 'What the f---? What do we do with this?'\"\nTrump also raised the idea in another conversation with a senior administration official. A 2017 NSC memo describes that second conversation, in which Trump asked whether the administration should bomb hurricanes to stop them from hitting the homeland. \n#idiotinchief #donaldtrump #dotard #trump #clueless #dumbasarock #25thamendment #sexualpredator #traitortrump #traitor #treason #racist #racistpresident #trumpcrimefamily #sexualassault #lgbtq #putinspuppet #lockhimup #biden2020 #joebiden #bidenharris #bountygate #trumpvirus #trump2020 #pandemic #maga #cult45 #trumpcult #hurricane #hurricanelaura","NumberOfLikes":23,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Trump Is Stupid on August 27, 2020.

Ia menelurusi fenomena bawah laut di Cenota Angelita, Mexico.\n\nSaat melakukan penyelaman, ia dikejutkan dengan sebuah fenomena alam yang luar biasa. Dia menemukan air tawar di antara air laut yang asin. Penemuan itu membuatnya takjub.  Bagaimana mungkin air tawar bisa berada terpisah dalam air laut yang asin? Tetapi itulah kenyataan yang dia temukan di dalam laut.\n\nRasa ingin tahunya yang besar membuat Costeau kembali menyelam lebih dalam lagi. Ia menyaksikan fenomena alam yang lebih mengejutkan lagi. Betapa tidak. Ia melihat ada sungai di dasar lautan.\n\nSungai di bawah laut itu ditumbuhi daun-daunan dan pohon. Para peneliti menyebut fenomena itu sebagai lapisan Hidrogen Sulfida. Tapi tampak seperti sungai? Yang menjadi tanda tanya par ahli, mengapa air yang mengalir di sungai bawah laut itu rasanya tawar?\n\nSesungguhnya, sekitar 14 abad lalu, Alquran telah menjelaskan fenomena itu.  Simak saja surah Al-Furqan [25] ayat 53: ''Dan Dialah yang membiarkan dua laut mengalir (berdampingan); yang ini tawar dan segar dan yang lain sangat asin lagi pahit; dan Dia Jadikan antara keduanya dinding dan barat yang tidak tembus.''\n\nSumber: Republika.com\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nFollow\n@pertemananshalihat_community\n\nDapatkan tausiyah-tausiyah, inspirasi dan tips seputar  muslimah dan rumahtangga di @pertemananshalihat_community\n\nBagi yang ingin tergabung, mengikuti KULWAP\/KULGRAM rutin & grstis seputar tema keluarga dan pernikahan silahkan kontak\nWA 0813-4423-1992 🙏\n\n#pertemananshalihat\n#pertemananshalihatcommunity\n#pertemananshalihatquotes \n#tausiyahnikah\n#hijrah\n#quotesislami\n#motivasi\n#nasehatislami\n#katamutiara\n#kajianislam\n#kajianbandung\n#kajianparentingbandung\n#Kajiankeluarga\n#kajiankeluargabandung\n#pernikahan\n#inspirasi\n#quoteoftheday\n#fiqihwanita\n#dakwah\n#tausiyah\n#tausiyahhariini \n#tipsrumahtangga \n#videoislami \n#resepmasakanrumahan \n#pernikahannewnormal\n#resepsinewnormal\n#dirumahaja \n#pandemic \n#quarantinelife \n#karantina","NumberOfLikes":2,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by 🧡PertemananShalihat Community🧡 on August 27, 2020.
