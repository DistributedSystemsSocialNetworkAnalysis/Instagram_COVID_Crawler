I am so grateful for everything I had that has helped me through the whole pandemic. \nI started Skills for Better, a platform for students to acquire new skills and volunteer with NGOs and put their new skills to use in the real world. \nI was also a member of the Ikshana Project, a fundraiser to help mentally challenged children receive access to education. In light of COVID-19 many such issues have been shadowed upon and we wanted to help the need of these children get noticed. We were able to raise 2 Lakh rupees with the help of our generous donors. \nCoping up with schools being shut and all learning moving to an online platform was a bit difficult at the start but once we slowed into the syllabus we were able to adapt to the whole online learning thing. There are so many things I\u2019ve learnt through out quarantine and this pandemic. The most important is to be grateful and content. Spending time with my family has been the best part of lockdown.

The tradition of immersion refused to budge even this year (as every year there is a clarion call for not infusing plaster idols into the river stream) when pandemic has reigned high in the district. Several locals, despite warnings from civic body and cops, were adamant on immersing Ganesh idols in the river. Some decided to fling them off the bridge whereas others gathered on the riverbed for the traditional immersion on the occasion of Gauri Visarjan. While the cops have been trying their best to shoo away these enthusiasts by not allowing them to immerse the idol in the riverbed near Shaniwar Peth and Deccan areas, the citizens are equally stern on following the tradition.

Perhaps it is the lengthening nights and how I am almost out the door before light crests the day as I set out on my morning walks, witnessing the rising sun, the coloring of the clouds from deep pink to white. Or maybe it is rustle of autumn in the turning leaves...the official turn of season less than four weeks away. The shifting of seasons stirring a desire to hunker down and journey within. \nüåÄ\nIt has been over five months since walking replaced lap swimming. The intimacy I feel with my neighborhood has deepened. I have watched flowers bud, blossom, and die (I find the irises fascinating.) Trees go from bare to full leaf and, soon, those leaves will fall to earth and decay. I have encountered new neighbors. Some have shared the death of their beloved pets. Others simply their name. Some just wave.\nüåÄ\nTogether we have watched a grassy park go from orange barricaded \u201Cno-go zone\u201D to a social-distancing, but welcoming, fenced dog park. Learned to negotiate a new kind of sidewalk etiquette. And have become familiar with each others daily rhythms.\nüåÄ\nThis world we are in, this in-flux world, some days the transformations are in tiny increments and other days the change is sudden, like a tree cut down. Startling. \nüåÄ\nEach morning I set out I imagine I am embarking on a new journey. Because really, I am. Just like a river is never the same from moment to moment, neither is the path where I place my feet. The air has stirred the leaves. Birds have eaten seeds. Life has come and gone. Transformation. It is all around me. It is happening within me. I am in a daily pilgrimage through this season. \nüåÄ\nWhat is transforming in your life? What are you notice as the season is shifting? \nüåÄ\n@nurtureyourjourney\n#nutureyourjourney\n#transformation\n#pilgrimage\n#coping_with_covid19\n#pandemic2020 \n#grief_and_loss","NumberOfLikes":6,"Hashtags":["#nutureyourjourney","#transformation","#pilgrimage","#coping_with_covid19","#pandemic2020","#grief_and_loss"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598586809,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 28 05:53:29 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"mind_eye_insight","CaptionText":"\u201CNever offer your heart\nto someone who eats hearts\nwho finds heartmeat delicious \n\nbut not rare\n\nwho sucks the juices\n\ndrop by drop\n\nand bloody-chinned\n\ngrins\n\nlike a God.\u201D\n\n#AliceWalker\n\n#AutoPortrait with #Violet \n#SelfPortrait\n#25August2020 \n#Photographed #AtHome in #Williamsburg\n#Brooklyn\n#Heart \n#NewYorkCity \n#Pandemic2020\n#LaFran√ßaise üé• \n#Reportage\n#Photography \n#JustineCudelPhotography","NumberOfLikes":14,"Hashtags":["#AliceWalker","#AutoPortrait","#Violet","#SelfPortrait","#25August2020","#Photographed","#AtHome","#Williamsburg","#Brooklyn","#Heart","#NewYorkCity","#Pandemic2020","#LaFran√ßaise","#Reportage","#Photography","#JustineCudelPhotography"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598586078,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 28 05:41:18 CEST 2020","Location":"Williamsburg"},{"Owner":"bsuraj509","CaptionText":"Your safety first..‡•§\nA woman sanitises the desk before Covid-19 test\n#covƒ±d19\n#pandemic2020 #coronavirus #testing #everydayindia #everyday #everywhereigo #storiesofindia #storiesofdelhi #sanatise #delhigrams #delhistreets #instagram #ƒ±nstagrammers #getty #natgeo","NumberOfLikes":52,"Hashtags":["#covƒ±d19","#pandemic2020","#coronavirus","#testing","#everydayindia","#everyday","#everywhereigo","#storiesofindia","#storiesofdelhi","#sanatise","#delhigrams","#delhistreets","#instagram","#ƒ±nstagrammers","#getty","#natgeo"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Suraj Singh Bisht in Delhi, India.

I used to think \"travel\" meant going across the ocean, on a plane, staying in a hotel and having an itinerary. That idea of travel isn't really sustainable, or even an option right now, so I've had to reinvent the way I define \"travel\".\n.\nI never wanted to \"go outside and play\". I don't like hot, cold, bugs, wind, or wet. I enjoy sitting. And eating and drinking are usually best done inside (and both of those happen to be hobbies of mine as well, in addition to sitting). But in the midst of this pandemic, I've been forced to spend more time in nature, and find ways to \"explore\" places that are untamed and un-reviewed on Yelp. I'm starting to understand why some people become \"outdoors enthusiasts\". Until you've been someplace outdoors, where you feel totally alone, small, and at peace, it doesn't click. It's starting to click for me, and I hope it already has for you.\n.\nSo I guess here's to thinking that the pandemic made me put \"travelling\" and \"exploring\" on hold. It just made me rediscover and reinvent what that looks like to me. Just as going for walks and baking bread were some of the first things I resorted to, it's been one of the first things I've let go of. I guess as we've gotten back into the busy-ness and \"reopening\" of things, I forgot to make time to do absolutely nothing, or try something new. I'm hoping that my new \"thirst\" for the outdoors continually reminds me that there's an endless list of things out there to be discovered, if I just make the time. \n\nLet's spend more time doing nothing. Or even better, doing nothing ùò∞ùò∂ùòµùò¥ùò™ùò•ùò¶.\n.\n.\n.\n#getoutandexplore #gooutsideandplay #goodtobealive #stateparks #pandemic2020 #willyoubemyquarantine #rediscoveryourself","NumberOfLikes":25,"Hashtags":["#getoutandexplore","#gooutsideandplay","#goodtobealive","#stateparks","#pandemic2020","#willyoubemyquarantine","#rediscoveryourself"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by A L L I S O N üîπ C O N N E R on August 27, 2020.

This is the method that The Budget Mom teaches that makes the most sense and finally stuck with me. There\u2019s two ways you keep track of things. \n.\nüóìFirst is on a calendar page. The picture is my calendar page from September 2019. You write down the days each bill is due as well as any appointments that cost money like a haircut or an oil change. You color code based on what bills you want to pay with what paycheck of the month. In this example you can see that my job that I called \u201CArmstrong\u201D is highlighted in pink. So I planned to pay all the bills highlighted in pink with the \u201Cpink paycheck.\u201D I also had other paychecks that month (yellow, blue, purple) and you can see which bills were paid with these. This helps keep track of your bills ahead of time and can give you an idea if you\u2019ll end up being short and need to pick up a shift or work your side hustle more. This method was VERY helpful during the pandemic when my hours were super small one minute and the next minute we were overrun with patients.\n.\nüöóThis also helps you not forget any expenses. That\u2019s why I say any appointments that cost money should go on here as well. üíáüèª\u200D‚ôÄÔ∏è\n.\nüìàI also have a monthly goal I keep track of on this page as well as my credit score.

I'd love some recommendations!\n\nIt is in a long long time that I come across a book that I'm not sure whether I like or not but it leaves an indelible mark on my heart. A book that is poignant yet disturbing, exciting yet powerful, intense yet dramatic and gripping in all its ways! That's the sort of book 'The Poison Of Love' was. You won't enjoy this book, you won't find an escape in it but you will be spellbound by what you read.\n\n#japreviews20 \n\n\"In principle, love and spirit are but one. Both ache to break free from fetters and take possession of suitable bodies.\"\n\n'The Poison Of Love' is essentially a story of toxic love, of love that grows on you, that claims you in its entirety, that takes away your 'self' from you. It is the story of Tulsi and Madhav. Tulsi, a woman who is attracted to this man in an irrevocable fashion. She foresakes everything, her family, her prospective career, her fiance, just to be with this man. This man who has had many dalliances in his past with women from all spheres of life asks Tulsi to marry him and she is naive enough to believe that he has fallen head over heals in love with her and would be faithful. But what unfolds is fierce, intense and bitter.\n\nK.R. Meera has written a deep, intense tale, a rather dark take on love. This is a book that speaks of and reflects on our primal instincts, desires and impulses. If you would ask me what was the best part about this book I would undoubtedly say it was K.R. Meera's writing. The translation is brilliantly done and I couldn't find a single flaw. Minishty retained the magic of Meera's writing in this book. There was an instance in the book that reminded me of the Greek tragedy- 'Medea' and that was the moment when I decided I would call this one a contemporary classic.\n\nMy takeaway from this book would be that an extreme sort of love and passion can lead to madness. Love can be like poison and this book sets out to warn you against that and it achieves that beautifully. Read this if you want to read something short yet unique.\n\nRead this for #readingwit readathon! ‚ù§Ô∏è","NumberOfLikes":459,"Hashtags":["#qotd-","#japreviews20","#readingwit"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by JAPNEET\u2022BOOKSTAGRAM\u2022IN üáÆüá≥ in Delhi, India with @booknerdparadise, @penguinindia, @penguinbooks, @bookishfeatures, @thebookoholics, @bookstafeatures, @ig.reads, @kr.meera, @igreadsindia, @mybookfeatures, @ms.teacupntale, @bookstagramfeatures, @aurora.engagement, @_readgret_, @perksofbookstagram, @shethepeoplebookclub, and @exploreindianliterature.

I'm Amber, a Child and Family Therapist and mother of two. @connectwithplay is place to come for advice, support and play ideas to support the parent-child connection. \n\nContinuing my week focusing on increasing calm within our parenting.\n\nThe Window of Tolerance is a great tool to use when trying to understand ourselves and why we might not handle difficult moments the same way all the time. It refers to how much we can handle before we dysregulate. \n\nAs parents, we strive to be in the optimal zone. This is the feeling of \"I've got this\" when we are met with difficult moments in our home. We are centered, calm and the ideal version of ourselves. \n\nWhen we are out of our window it is harder to stay in control and we can be thrown off balance more easily. \n\nThis concept provides us with a better understanding of ourselves and a starting point to discover what makes our tolerance higher and lower. It goes without saying that all of our rivers are probably a little narrower due to this pandemic and all that it has thrust upon us. \n\nHowever, when we turn self-blame to curiosity we can begin to give ourselves a little bit of grace, compassion and hopefully develop more strategies to stay within our window during times of stress.\n\nThe strategies provided are general, but I would love to hear how you all widen your rivers\/window of tolerance.

Foto: Luc√≠a Mart√≠. Sobre brotes e infancias \n\u201CMi nombre es Jorge Bentancur, tengo 65 a√±os. Pertenezco a una familia fundadora (1834) del primer barrio de Montevideo: la Villa del Cerro. Un barrio de trabajadores con las Carboner√≠as, los Saladeros y la Industria Frigor√≠fica que aportaron mucho al Uruguay de las vacas gordas. Amo mi barrio y tengo 50 a√±os de militancia social para contribuir a que todos tengamos oportunidades de llegar a un desarrollo integral como personas. Hace 15 a√±os fundamos la Organizaci√≥n de Usuarios de Salud del Zonal 17, de la cual fui uno de los pioneros. Realizamos un diagn√≥stico participativo donde participaron 300 vecinos y con esos insumos se elabor√≥ un Plan \u2018Salud derecho de todos\u2019 con 6 programas. El tema prioritario fue la constituci√≥n de la Red de Primera Infancia en 2006, somos la Cuna del pa√≠s con 4000 nacimientos por a√±o, de los cuales el 43% nacen en hogares pobres. All√≠ est√°n todos los centros educativos y de salud que trabajan la poblaci√≥n de 0 a 3 a√±os. En marzo cerraron 23 policl√≠nicas, las cual luego convencimos a las autoridades que era un disparate y reabrieron. Gracias al Primer Nivel de Atenci√≥n que la mayor√≠a de los casos de COVID 19 pudieron ser resueltos  sin internaci√≥n.  Por otro lado los peque√±os dejaron de concurrir a los Centros Educativos. Es sabido que el cerebro crece sobre todo en los primeros dos a√±os de vida. Partiendo del nacimiento, seg√∫n los est√≠mulos que haya recibido, la alimentaci√≥n correcta, etc... Puede tener 100% de neuronas o 50%. La no concurrencia a los Centros Educativos de Primera Infancia puede causar da√±os irreparables que hoy no tienen visibilidad. Teniendo en cuenta que el mayor capital de cualquier pa√≠s son los ni√±os y ni√±as que lo integran. Esperemos que los que toman las decisiones tengan conciencia de esto.\nüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëá üëá \n#pandemia #pandemic #pandemic2020 #covid_19 #covid_19uruguay #coronavirus #coronavirusuruguay #derechoshumanos #infancias #pobreza #salud #primerainfancia #cerro #primerniveldeatenci√≥n #fotodocumental #fotoregistro #fotorreportaje  #cronicas #cotidianidad","NumberOfLikes":26,"Hashtags":["#pandemia","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#covid_19","#covid_19uruguay","#coronavirus","#coronavirusuruguay","#derechoshumanos","#infancias","#pobreza","#salud","#primerainfancia","#cerro","#primerniveldeatenci√≥n","#fotodocumental","#fotoregistro","#fotorreportaje","#cronicas","#cotidianidad"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by AnA cUeStA on August 26, 2020 tagging @3maicul.

It came to me in the shower üöø (where we all do our best thinking, right?) I was thinking about quilting and how this year has brought so many growing pains for me, as it has for so many others. But it\u2019s also brought me this creative outlet: sewing. I\u2019ve found a lot of joy in it! And I feel like so many people have their own 2020 stories to tell. We are all in this very same pandemic\/political\/economical\/emotional tornado üå™  but our stories are varied and nuisanced and painted differently. Instagram only tells a piece. Sometimes though, a piece is enough. Sometimes it\u2019s the most important piece to tell. Sometimes when you start with a piece, the rest of the story begins to flow. \n\nI\u2019m going to sew another quilt. But with this one I need help. The quilt is going to tell a story about this year. And it needs your piece. ‚ù§Ô∏è \n\nSend me a piece of fabric. But theres a catch....it can\u2019t just be any piece. I want this piece of fabric to have significance. I want it to tell part of your 2020 story. It can be from a shirt, a onesie, a blanket, a curtain, a towel...6.5 inches by 6.5 inches. It\u2019s just a piece, but maybe in sharing that one piece, your story takes a new perspective. Maybe it helps you let go. Maybe it\u2019s something that fills you with joy, or pain, or laughter, or anger or love. If you choose to send me one, feel free to include why you choose that piece of fabric. Or not! I respect that sometimes things are just personal and private and\u2014especially if I only know you marginally,\u2014it might feel uncomfortable to share. I also know that sometimes sharing with people you only know marginally is helpful- when we say things out loud or on paper it doesn\u2019t make them so daunting...or it makes them bigger! Or more funny! Or whatever! Sometimes it\u2019s good to share. Either way, I want your piece of fabric. Because otherwise this 2020 #storyquilt won\u2019t happen. And I think it needs to. \n\nIf you\u2019re serious about sending, DM me and I\u2019ll give you details on where to send. I probably need a deadline, so let\u2019s go with September 30. \n\nThanks for indulging me.

The idea of a remote camping getaway seemed great, but the heat wave and wildfires keep reminding me to just stay home where it\u2019s comfy and air conditioned and safe. I\u2019m getting through it just fine and I know I\u2019m doing the responsible thing by staying home. And I\u2019ve been going to weekly therapy to help with my anxiety and coping with stress. Is anyone else feeling simultaneously antsy to get out but also anxious about actually doing it? üòÖ\nAnyway, here\u2019s a photo of me in my favorite place: my bed. I took this shot for @52frames back in February.

Crafts. Coughs. Handshakes and hugs. Maybe it isn\u2019t the worst that when we do allow ourselves to have those moments we savor them.  That we appreciate the teachers and how they turn themselves inside out to make all the days creative, loving, educational, fun.  That we have ventured outside. Spent time with our loved ones.

This is not me, this is now who I was with them... I am in the unthinkable situation that people cannot bear to contemplate.\u201D\n\nWave is about Sonali Deraniyagala\u2019s husband, her parents, and her two sons, aged seven and five, all of whom died in a single morning in December, 2004, when the tsunami hit the resort where they were holidaying in Sri Lanka.\n\nIt is one of the most difficult books I have read till date. The grief, the rage and the accompanying helpless is intense. The juxtaposition with the happy family times makes it worse almost unbearable to read in one go. The book shows how grief is fiercely individualistic nothing that one can truly share with another human being no matter how hard you try. \n\n#portraitofgrief #wave #sonalideraniyagala #tsunami #loss #longing #grief #death #memoir #personalstory #pagesofpain #difficultbooks #pandemicreading #pandemic2020 #tsunamiwaves #losingyourfamily #tragedy #womenofcolour #powerfulmemoir #nationalbestseller #goodreads","NumberOfLikes":19,"Hashtags":["#portraitofgrief","#wave","#sonalideraniyagala","#tsunami","#loss","#longing","#grief","#death","#memoir","#personalstory","#pagesofpain","#difficultbooks","#pandemicreading","#pandemic2020","#tsunamiwaves","#losingyourfamily","#tragedy","#womenofcolour","#powerfulmemoir","#nationalbestseller","#goodreads"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Nectar In A Sieve in Everywhere.

And of course, we pack some ready to eat and snacks from home.\n\u2063\nACTIVITIES: Mostly trekking and hiking, resist public space\n\u2063\nIn the end, it is all about minimising the probability and possibility of interaction with anyone üòä\n.\n.\n.\n.\n #earthofficial #planetdiscovery #bcctravel #travelandlife #travelbloggers #nomadgirls #darlingescapes #pandemic2020 #pandemictravel #clickmagazine #indiaig #ngtindia #travelgirlsgo #sheisnotlost #wondefulplaces #hotelsandresorts #hotellife #bloggersofig #openmyworld #campchhatrasagar #raaschhatrasagar #raashotel #rajasthandiaries #wanderlust #rajasthantourism #tblogger #discoverindia #wowplacestogo #safetravels #adventureseeker","NumberOfLikes":123,"Hashtags":["#earthofficial","#planetdiscovery","#bcctravel","#travelandlife","#travelbloggers","#nomadgirls","#darlingescapes","#pandemic2020","#pandemictravel","#clickmagazine","#indiaig","#ngtindia","#travelgirlsgo","#sheisnotlost","#wondefulplaces","#hotelsandresorts","#hotellife","#bloggersofig","#openmyworld","#campchhatrasagar","#raaschhatrasagar","#raashotel","#rajasthandiaries","#wanderlust","#rajasthantourism","#tblogger","#discoverindia","#wowplacestogo","#safetravels","#adventureseeker"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Travel Girl|Neha Jain in Camp Chhatra Sagar with @travelandlife, @tripotocommunity, @cnntravel, @thrillophilia, @rangeelorajasthan, @colors.of.india, @rajasthan_tourism, @wearetravelgirls, @campchhatrasagar, @padharo_mahre_desh, @raashotels, @travulls, @tripadvisorindia, @damestravel, @rajasthan.clicks, @wearethetravelgirls, @on_air_pics, @indiangirlstravel, @indiangirlswander, and @colors.of.rajasthan.
