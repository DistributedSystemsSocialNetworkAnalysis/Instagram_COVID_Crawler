Today, I would like to share with you some of my thoughts and images regarding \u201Cthe pandemic of 2020.\u201D Please bear in mind that I wrote this statement a few months ago and some things have changed, but the message still holds true... Since the announcement of Covid-19 as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020, the world as we knew it no longer exists. We are living in unfamiliar territory. Everything, every single thing, has taken on a new meaning. Nothing is as it was. I have witnessed this shift in meaning as I have continued to work on my ongoing series, The story of us. Photographed with an iPhone 7, this series is a visual record of human interaction as seen by the traces that have been left behind. The intention has been to engage and elevate what it has meant to be human within our digital culture. With the rise of the Covid-19 disease, the words quarantine, lockdown, and social distancing have entered into the vernacular. Things like toilet paper, cleanser, and hand sanitizer are in scarce supply. And the real heroes of the system have been revealed as healthcare workers, delivery people, grocery store workers, and sanitation workers, just to name a few. These new developments have manifested for me in how I understand the images I make. The objects I typically single out for a found still-life with my camera, no longer stand for what they used to. A stream of toilet paper floating down the sidewalk calls to mind wastefulness in this time of panic, hoarding and subsequent scarcity. A discarded bra on a street curb could have been a DIY face mask and a paper face mask lies on the side of the road reminding us of the pandemic we are all experiencing. This grouping of images is a continuation of the work I have been making but the subject matter directly addresses what it means to be human within our pandemic world.  #spemidatlantic #mobilephotography #digitalphotogtaphy #iphonography #pandemic2020 #quarantineart #makearteveryday #phillystreetphotographer #femalestreetphotographer","NumberOfLikes":1,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598576060,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 28 02:54:20 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Chile Verde con Arroz, Frijoles Negros, guacamole, ensalada y Tortillas Hechas A Mano \nChille Verde with Rice, Black Beans, Guacamole, and Salad with Fire roasted Salsa 🔥🙌🏾👨\u200D🍳\n#todaysmenu #chileverde #porkslowlycookedinSalsaVerde#blackbeans #Arroz #guacamole #fireroasted #salsa #homemade #corn #tortillas #mexicanfood #comidamexicana #august #everythingfromscratch  #pandemic2020 #privatechef #blessed  #chefjosealberto #personalchefservice #privatechef #everythingfromscratch #cheflife #foodgawker  #buzzfeedfood  #dailyfoodfeed #foodporn #foodie #chefsofinstagram  #everydayisthebestday #thankyougodforanotherday #cheflife #graciasdiosporayudarmesiempre","NumberOfLikes":7,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Josealberto on August 27, 2020.

It was the first time since the pandemic and it was sad.  More than half of the stores were closed and the ones that were open, had hardly anyone in them. Except for @victoriassecret ~ there are always women buying panties! Anyway, it made me long for the days of walking by someone and smiling where they could see your mouth and smile back, it made me miss seeing people out shopping and contributing to our economy, it made me sad that I had to be conscious of social distancing and staying 6 feet away.  It made me sad for what once was.  Will we ever shake hands again, hug people, brush up against someone without worrying or be able to pass someone without masks, smile and get a smile back?  I never knew how good normalcy was until it was gone.  I never knew the simple things would no longer be simple. I used to hate sunglasses because I couldn\u2019t see the person\u2019s eyes but now I realize that I hate masks more.  I appreciate the good old days so much now and I pray that one day soon, we will get back some normal that we once knew. We need it. This economy needs it. This country needs it. 🙏🏻💙❤️😢","NumberOfLikes":18,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Meschelle K on August 27, 2020.

The 2020 medal for the fight against coronavirus in Russia and other countries is primarily eligible for:\n⚪ Doctors and healthcare professionals;\n⚪ Employees of the Ministry of Emergency Situations, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Defense and other law enforcement agencies;\n⚪ Volunteers;\n⚪ And other categories of citizens.\n⠀\nWhat makes this Covid medal unique? It has a number of unique features that set it apart from most other coronavirus awards that various organizations plan to issue:\n⠀\n✅ The only universal medal: it is suitable not only for medical professionals, but also for representatives of any other services and departments. Precisely for reasons of universality, the designers of the Factory of Rewards, when developing the concept of the medal, abandoned the image of the Red Cross and other medical symbols. There are no analogues of such a medal either in Russia or abroad. If desired, a certificate with the signature and seal of the award commission is supplied with the medal \"for the fight against Covid\".\n⠀\n✅ The only international medal: The universal design of this Covid19 award is suitable for any country in the world;\n⠀\n✅ The only personalized medal: because the text is laser-engraved on the permanent stamped base of the pandemic award, it can be produced individually for each member of even large teams. Thus, each fighter with coronavirus will receive his own award separately.\n⠀\n❗ You can order the medal for dedication in the fight against the pandemic only from the official manufacturer - the Factory of Awards company.\n⠀\nWe can use laser engraving to apply any inscription and decor on the obverse and reverse of the medal❗\n⠀\nMedal cost: 6$ (\u203C Discounts from quantity\u203C)\n⠀\n#covid #coronavirus #covid19 #covid19 #coronavirus #pandemic #covid_19 #medicine #covid #coronavirus2020 #pandemic2020 #thankstodoctors #corona #pandemiccovid #coronavirus pandemic #medal #award #order #cup #victory #coinsmedal #gift #numismatics #badges #stamping #medals #souvenir","NumberOfLikes":2,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Фабрика Наград on August 27, 2020.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598560499,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 27 22:34:59 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Definitely once in a lifetime experiences right now 😷 stay safe, stay healthy!\nThank you @lmonsivais for the masks!\nRepresenting @matisyahu gear on \n________________________________________\n#pandemic #pandemic2020 #coronavirus #stayhealthy #staysafe #mask #matisyahu #oneday","NumberOfLikes":77,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Chase Castillo, M.D. in Baltimore, Maryland.

Baseados em produtos e projetos locais, que vão de açaí a cosméticos, pequenos negócios inovadores começam a transformar o cenário regional.\n\nA economia verde, ou de baixo carbono, deve ajudar a região amazônica - que representa cerca de 60% do território brasileiro - a dar um salto em sua participação no Produto Interno Bruto (PIB), hoje de apenas 8%, segundo avaliação de especialistas no tema.\n\nO caminho trilhado por um número crescente de startups amazônicas para essa nova economia envolve comunidades ribeirinhas, indígenas, quilombolas e agricultores familiares. A lógica está em aplicar ciência e tecnologia a dezenas de ativos da região desde o início da cadeia de produção para aumentar o valor dos produtos e beneficiar as populações locais.\n\nFabricante de cosméticos feitos com óleos extraídos de plantas da região, a startup Biozer se prepara para exportar seus produtos para os Estados Unidos, Emirados Árabes e Europa. Já o Café Agroflorestal de Apuí utiliza grãos de plantações em áreas sombreadas pela floresta e será enviado para a Alemanha. Os chocolates da De Mendes são feitos com cacau nativo colhido por ribeirinhos e índios e chegam a consumidores de vários Estados e também do exterior.\n\nLink na bio.\n\nFonte: Estadão\n\n#covid19 #coronavirus #ONN #onovonormal #ONNpoliticapublica #covidart #covid2020, #covid19brasil #covidmask #covidphotodiaries #covidnews #covid19art #corona #coronavírus #coronavirusbrazil #coronaviruspandemic #coronavirusoutbreak #coronavirus2020 #pandemic #pandemicart #pandemic2020, #pandemicorona #pandemiclife  #homeoffice #trabalhandoemcasa #emcasa #comolimparmascara  #usemask #mask","NumberOfLikes":68,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by O Novo Normal in São Paulo, Brazil.

I know none of these and even all of them combined will ever be enough, but maybe for now it\u2019s how they \u2014 her husband, daughter, sons and all those Virginia left behind --- will be able to get through the coming weeks.\n\nAs for my questions -  I have no answers. And maybe all I need to understand is that there is no answer to these situations.  All we can do is trust that God is sovereign, He holds our life, He is in control and that He loves us.❤️\n\n#reflections #death #funeral #covidcomplication #deathcomeslikeathiefinthenight #pandemic2020 #friends #relationship #pinay #Filipina #pinaynurse\n-\n #Covid19Narratives \n #AlwaysRemember\n #RestInPeace  #RIP\n #Covid19  #Covid_19\n #CoronaVirus\n #FuckCovid19\n #FuckCorona\n #covid19italia\n #Covid19Espana\n #wuhanchina\n #covid19UK\n #coronavirusindia\n #covid19India\n #inmemoriam","NumberOfLikes":5,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by #1 🌍 COVID Memorial 🇺🇸🇭🇺🇪🇸🇬🇧🇹🇷 in Philippines with @jescel.

Jika gigi tidak terhalang gusi, pencabutan bisa dilakukan tanpa melalui pembedahan.

This is a major policy change since making the announcement back in 2012 of having the 2 percent inflation target. \n\nPowell says the policy change received unanimous approval. Central bank officials traditionally have believed that low unemployment leads to dangerously higher levels of inflation, and they\u2019ve moved preemptively to head it off.\n\nPowell contrasted what is happening in the economy today with what the feds faced 40 years ago. Ex-Chairman Paul Volcker made controversial policy decisions to put downward pressure to high inflation through a series of hikes in rates. Powell highlighted that the fundamentals of the economy has changed and that in recent times they have focused too heavily on having inflation run low.\n\nSince the end of the financial crisis, the Fed has struggled to hit its 2% inflation target. Officials hope that the new approach will change the landscape, raising expectations and allowing inflation to float higher as rates remain low.\n\nReported By: CNBC, Yahoo!

Pandemi ini telah merusak tatanan jadwal yang seharusnya berjalan seperti biasa menjadi luar biasa. Yang awalnya segala kegiatan bisa dipertemukan dengan tatap muka, kali ini jadi tatap layar ponsel. Semua orang, dalam keadaan apapun, harus siap untuk beradaptasi dengan segala keadaan yang telah berubah menjadi baru.\n\nPun dalam dunia literasi, rasanya para penulis dituntut produktif meski kedai-kedai buku alias toko buku memilih tutup pintu. Hanya beberapa saja yang memilih bertahan untuk tetap buka, itu pun dalam durasi yang terbatas dan harus setia menunggu pembeli yang semakin surut. Ingat, semua orang dituntut untuk adaptif dalam menghadapi era baru ini. Maka, banyak diantara penerbit-penerbit buku\u2014juga perpustakaan umum\u2014yang memilih membuka jasa cetak buka dalam bentuk elektronik.\n\nApa nggak rugi? Lalu dapat untungnya cuman dikit dong? Enak di pembaca, rugi di penerbit, kan? Emangnya nggak ribet? Perpustakaan nggak rugi?\n\nItu sudah jadi pertanyaan yang pantas dijadikan headline. Tak semuanya bisa dijawab iya, buktinya dengan adanya e-book minta baca masyarakat cukup meningkatkan. Kaum rebahan yang semakin malas di rumah aja menjadi terbiasa baca buku hape, para rakyat kecil tak kesulitan buat baca buku, dan semakin ke sini semakin gencar para pemuda yang berusaha membangkitkan semangat literasi melalui kelas menulis online, salah satunya komunitas one day one post.\n\nNah, jadi era pandemi ini harusnya kita bertambah aktif, produktif, dan solutif. Jangan mau kalah sama Bu Tejo 😁. Tidak ada yang namanya kendala, siapa mau berusaha, di sana pasti ada jalan. So, yang perlu kita lakukan adalah mengapresiasi setiap perubahan yang ada dalam kehidupan di masa baru ini, khususnya dalam dunia literasi, dengan semangat membiasakan membaca, menulis, dan produktif berkarya. \n\nSalam sukses, salam literasi 💖✍️\n\n#literasi #buku #elektronik #nulis #penerbit #perpustakaan #era #new #pandemic2020 #kreatif  #adaptif #solutif #aktif #komunitas #one #day #one #post","NumberOfLikes":19,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Hima Abida on August 27, 2020.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598544644,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 27 18:10:44 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"The Hotel Association of India (HAI) has entered into a partnership with Naukri.com to create alternative livelihoods and opportunities for the impacted workforce of HAI member hotels.\nHAI and Naukri.com have entered into a MoU to assist those whose jobs have been affected due to the pandemic.

I certainly wasn\u2019t. I eventually caught on, but at first I didn\u2019t thing it would last as long as it has. \n\u2022\n\u2022 \nAmidst normal life, raising my twins, being a wife, starting a business, running a home, and #survivingcovid19, I\u2019ve been drained...in every way - mentally, physically, spiritually, and FINANCIALLY. So when our 2 push lawn mowers gave out right at the BEGINNING of summer 😅😭, we stressed about it. Well, I stressed about it and stressed my poor husband about it. We contemplated going against @daveramsey\u2019s advice and going into MORE debt just to get an actually decent riding lawn mower (we have a pretty big lawn), contemplated just creating a budget for paying someone to come do it every week (like at LEAST 200 a month) and even begging my mom for help. \n\u2022\n\u2022\nBut God stepped in. Our next door neighbor is selling his house. Our lawn had been overgrowing for QUITE A WHILE. It\u2018a been bad, y\u2019all. About 2 months ago, I was standing in the kitchen, making lunch for my sons when I heard a knock at the door. I immediately scooted around the island to hide my pantless body and yelled downstairs to ask my husband to get the door. My husband answered the door and this is what I heard, \u201CHey man, how you doing? I live next door and we\u2019re selling our house. I noticed you guys could use a cut, I can cut you guys\u2019 the same day I cut mine?\u201D Hubby looked back at me, I shrugged, as if to signify to him \u201Cup to you\u201D, and he said, \u201CYes sir, that\u2019d be great, thank you!\u201D. \n\u2022\n\u2022\nI won\u2019t lie, I was grateful, but at first I was also a little irritated and defensive about it. \u201CWhatever, he just wants to sell his house, he ain\u2019t doing us any favors!\u201D But wasn\u2019t he? Sure, our lawn next to his may have scared off a few potential buyers, but I\u2019m sure he would still sell it. And we REALLY needed the help. And then I realized it was such a silly thing to be stressing about in the first place. It\u2019s grass. If people judge you for letting grass grow untamed during a pandemic, then SCREW THEM!","NumberOfLikes":4,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Asia Speights \/\/ Biz Owner in Kentucky.

I haven't posted many photos of myself since lockdown started in March. When this global pandemic hit, all the beautiful and empowering self care I had worked towards, that took me decades to finally make my \"new normal\"...well I kind of tossed it all out the window. I allowed fear to take over me. I got sick and have been struggling to get back to the healthy version of me for months. It's hard to excercise when you are exhausted and recovering from whatever I had. \n.\n.\nThis has all led to major imposter syndrome. How can I possibly share about wellness if I am not walking the walk? How did I let myself go back down that path of unhealthy choices, I worked so hard to undo? \nDuring all of this, I have been trying to give myself grace and I have been  completely understanding as to why I have allowed myself to eat horribly, not excercise, not sleep enough etc etc. I have taken comfort in the fact that my reaction to this pandemic is a reaction of so many. So believe me when I say I am working hard to not wollow of feel sorry for myself. I KNOW how small changes can lead to HUGE results. I have, in my decades long struggle with body image and self hate, experienced incredible metamorphosis. If I have done it before, than I can do it again. \nI think all sizes are beautiful. I love all bodies. I think I am awesome, regardless of weight. So please know that this is not rooted in fatphobia. That being said, binge eating on junk food, not moving my body and occasionally drinking alcohol for months has resulted in me gaining a lot of weight. Enough for me to decide this morning, that enough is enough. I deserve better. I need to start properly loving myself again. As of today, while continuing to give myself grace, I am not going to make any more excuses. \nAs of today I am cutting out all the crap! \nI will start eating better again. I will start exercising again. I will stop binge watching Netflix. I will start reading books again. I will clean my home and enjoy the feeling of a clean space. \nI hit my breaking point this morning. It's time to turn this ship AROUND y'all! \nNo guilt!No negative self talk!\nJust one day at a time.","NumberOfLikes":25,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Cat Choi on August 27, 2020.

Homeschooling is something that OTHER families do. It seems like a nice idea, but it\u2019s definitely not my jam. Yet, here we are\u2026\n.\n.\nI feel like this homeschooling thing is my whole life right now. I could have sent my kids back to school with their friends, at their private school, which we do in fact love and miss. Alternatively, I could\u2019ve enrolled them in our local school district, and even chosen an online option. Neither of these choices felt quite right, not right now. \n.\n.\nThe way we\u2019re doing this is so hands-on, and intimate, and strangely satisfying. Granted, the feelings of satisfaction aren\u2019t QUITE as intense when I\u2019m breaking up a squabble or LITERALLY BEGGING someone to pay attention, but mostly, it\u2019s just\u2026 good.\n.\n.\nWe are laughing, and learning, and making memories. I\u2019m spending a great deal of time reading to my kids every day. I\u2019ve been so inspired by @readaloudrevival, and I\u2019m completely psyched about the fact that I have time and freedom to give my kids the gift of some incredible read-aloud experiences this school year.\n.\n.\nBig props also to @MasterBooks. We\u2019re really loving their Christ-centered curricula. It\u2019s a perfect fit for our family and the kids\u2019 learning styles.\n.\n.\nIt\u2019s a messy, weird time. I don\u2019t really know what the right answers are when it comes to moving beyond this pandemic-mindset.

I don\u2019t actually believe there are any experts who can tell our future for sure as C19 is \u201Cnovel\u201D that nobody has the full knowledge of, but I can confirm at least one thing, that this virus has changed our way of travelling for the time being.\n\nI flew to London from Seoul with Etihad Airways last night.\nThe Incheon International Airport was always crowded at any time of the day before, but it was totally empty last night. There were a lot more staff than passengers, even though most businesses were closed.\n\nI arrived at the airport 3.5 hours before the departure, just in case there are delays due to additional stuff to do because of C19. And it was totally the right decision.\n\nI first went to a spot to get my luggage wrapped with film for hygiene. Both the check-in and the carry-on luggage. It cost me about US$25.\n\nWhen I went to the check in counter of the airline, a staff asked me if I had any masks in my check-in luggage, I said yes, and the staff advised to transfer them to the carry-on luggage because the Customs needs to check them as I can take only upto 30 masks out of Korea. The staff also said that I could take 150 masks if I am a resident overseas. Phew\u2026 I am a resident in UK. I had 120 masks on me.\n\nSo I went back to the wrapping station which is located at the far end of the departure level, tore the wrapping up, transferred the masks to my carry-on luggage and got my check-in luggage wrapped again. It cost me another US$15.\n\nTo be continued...\n\n#covid19 #pandemic2020 #c19story #travel #airtravel #travelwithcoronavirus #lifewithcoronavirus","NumberOfLikes":9,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598483740,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 27 01:15:40 CEST 2020","Location":"인천공항 Incheon Airport"},{"CaptionText":"New blog post!

That they didn\u2019t have to be glued to a computer & I didn\u2019t have to be frustrated when they didn\u2019t know how. Yesterday I woke up w\/a growth mindset because this isn\u2019t going to last forever. Because soon we\u2019ll all be back to work\/school longing for the days that we got to stay home.

People who die are tested lost-mortim if CPR was used or if the cause of death was respiratory related. A person who dies in a car accident, heart attack or gun shot wound is not reported to the CDC. If anything, the numbers are under reported  as not everyone has access to the Covid test and asymptomatic people are not always tested. \n\nNot wearing a mask in public makes you complicit.

It is unusual to have an uptick in respiratory infections during summer and I myself working in healthcare see the tests being done and I have to send people to the ER due to severe Covid-19.

Two years later a beloved NYC tradition began and this spot has become \u201CA gathering place and reflection of what was happening in the world around it\". \n\nI have seen \u201Cthe tree\u201D every year of my life and since 2001, I have had the joy of sharing this tradition with thousands of tourists.

Today\u2019s stop on my pandemic Hollywood tour is the house from the show \u201CYoung Sheldon\u201D which is a spin-off of the highly popular sitcom \u201CThe Big Bang Theory\u201D!\n\nTaking place in the late 80s\/early 90s, \u2018Young Sheldon\u2019 focuses on the childhood of the most popular character of \u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019 Sheldon Cooper and revolves around his coming-of-age in East Texas. \n\nThe supposed Medford, Texas home of the Cooper family on the series is actually located at \u202A5501 Morella Avenue in Valley Village\u202C! The house, which was built in 1949, is designed with a ranch aesthetic and is located just more than a couple of miles from Warner Bros. Studio - where all the interior scenes are shot. Please note that this is a private residence so if you visit please do not trespass or disturb the people that live there.\n\nThis funny CBS sitcom was created by Chuck Lorre and stars Iain Armitage as young Sheldon, alongside Zoe Perry, Lance Barber, Montana Jordan, Raegan Revord, and the fabulous Annie Potts as Constance \"Connie\" Sheldon\u2019s grandmother, whom everyone refer to as \"Meemaw\". Jim Parsons, who portrays the adult Sheldon Cooper on The Big Bang Theory, narrates the series and serves as an executive producer.\n\nFun facts - Zoe Perry plays Sheldon's mother, Mary Cooper. Perry is the real-life daughter of Laurie Metcalf, who portrayed the older version of Mary Cooper on \u201CThe Big Bang Theory.\u201D\n\nThe idea of the show first came to Jim Parsons. At first, he did not discuss it with Chuck Lorre because he thought that Lorre must have considered it before. But when Jim finally consulted him, Chuck liked the idea and had not thought about it before.\n\nIain Armitage (Young Sheldon) said he was committed to his role of Sheldon thanks to Jim Parsons (Adult Sheldon) coaching him and explaining who Sheldon is.\n\nIn the Thanksgiving episode in season 2, Missy says she is thankful for there being two Ghostbuster cartoons. Annie Potts, who plays MeeMaw, appeared in the two live action Ghostbuster movies and the 2016 reboot. #filminglocation #youngsheldon #jimparsons #valleyvillage #hollywoodtour #pandemic2020 #socialdistancing #wearamask #tonymiros","NumberOfLikes":25,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598459998,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 26 18:39:58 CEST 2020","Location":"Valley Villiage, Ca"},{"CaptionText":"Dm to get your Instagram account verified\n\n#obama, #meekmill, #coronavirus, #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":1,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by GRAMMER on August 26, 2020.

Just what my thoughts are in these challenging times... A Pandemic Season\n\n Cancelled travels, crumpled plans, changes in work settings and endless worries for our health and those of our loved ones.\n\nOver half of the year has passed and not much has been ticked from our goals, plans and things to be done.\n\nVirtual meetings, online parties, social media are means to connect with people we used to spend time with.\n\nIn these trying times and quiet moments our lives, we pray for miracles and that ray of hope that things will be better in the season of Christmas wreaths.\n\nDeep within us there is a clash of optimism, worry, compassion, sadness and fear in times like these.\n\nPandemic can be stressful for all of us affected in varying degrees.\n\nAllow ourselves to deal with the now by taking time to process our emotions as we prepare for what lies ahead that is still unknown.\n\nNew normal that is how it will be from now on, but has it been normal for us before?\n\nDespite all the challenges brought about by COVID and more.\n\nEvery new day is a blessing for coping and experiencing the many blessings in disguise.\n\nMay we all be recipients of kindness, care, healing and all the help we need.\n\nI can only hope and pray that situation can be more friendly.\n\nCan you be a little kinder and please slow down 2020?\n\nCan you spot words going down from the 1st letter of each line.

Sebenarnya saya masih sedang menjalani rawatan dan masih terdapat 1 pembedahan dalam KIV pada September ini. (Terima kasih banyak atas doa kalian).\n\nSaya berhenti berkongsi perkembangan kesihatan saya di FB atas beberapa faktor terutamanya demi menjaga kesihatan mental dan emosi saya sendiri. Tidak semua mata senang, oleh itu saya pilih untuk saya yang bertenang. Sebab saya orangnya matang. (TIBERRR)\n\nUntuk kawan-kawan yang kami kasihi, insyaAllah kami akan buat majlis kedua selepas saya sembuh sepenuhnya dan selepas wabak beransur pulih. Waktu itu, nanti kami jemput semua ya jika diizinkan. Jemputan pertama ini untuk keluarga terdekat dek kerana PKP dan kehendak kami untuk menunaikan tuntutan ibadah aqiqah dan nazar kami secepat mungkin.\n\nTerima kasih juga ahli keluarga terlibat dan yang hadir dari ibu bapa kami, adik beradik kami, sepupu2 kami, mak cik dan pak cik yang membantu kami set up majlis dari awal sampai akhir dan sentiasa memahami kekangan faktor kesihatan saya.(Sebab aku tinggal datang ja 😂) Kudos. \n\nTerima kasih semua 💜💜💜\n\n#HayyansAqiqah\n#pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":61,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Anne Yassin on August 26, 2020 tagging @hafizjoseph.

What caused her to do that? \nA lot of readers wrote me that it made them very uncomfortable. That used to bother me, because I'm human and take criticisms to heart...but then I realized that it makes perfect sense. To embrace, or even acknowledge, #uncertainty , there's going to be discomfort. And that's because answers are comforting. Answers make the world seem easier and predictable. Embracing uncertainty is about letting go of the need for answers and finding the power & wisdom to say, \"I don't know\" & \"I'll be okay without having all the answers.\"\nHope you guys read it if you haven't yet,  it's available on Amazon & through my website. I plan on doing a podcast related to this and uncertainty. Speaking of uncertainty..., there's \"certainly\" a lot of uncertainty surrounding this pandemic. A lot of unknowns. Many people are having trouble coping with the pandemic, because they don't know how to cope with uncertainty.

So what did I do? I cleaned my kitchen. \n.\nAs a Type A person, I admit that one of the crappiest things about this pandemic is having little to no control about stuff that I used to plan and execute properly. There are probably a hundred things that I could have done better in my personal life, job, grad school, and side jobs if not for this virus. About 80% of my frustrations are deeply rooted in things that I cannot control anymore because of current circumstances. \n.\nHere's where keeping our kitchen tidy becomes a sanity-saver. I have control over how organized our pantry is and how long I want the cleaning process to take. I guess even for a little while, the act of taking back that control reminds me that not everything is lost in the world just yet. Of course, this is just me. I'm pretty sure others are going through times that are way tougher than mine - may it be financial, medical, physiological, or emotional. Still, it helps to identify your personal triggers and struggles, plus how to address them. It just happened that this is how I handled mine. \n.\nBottom line is, clean your space.

Although we are privileged enough to not feel the heat every moment there are major changes which have stepped in our everyday normal lives.\nFor the most of us to be sane & be at peace with ourselves in this very moment is a big deal!\nYou will always be surrounded by people due to availability of technology but even though it\u2019s not so easy to seek help when we need it the most. Honestly, even I struggle with It almost every time.\nThis is not a utopian world but a reality through which we all have to live through every day. During this time, I felt the need to feel happy & I tried few things which did the magic for me. I wholeheartedly want to share this with all of you. If you are going through anything alike - TRY THIS! :)\n\n\u2022Digital Detox - Social media lately has been quite filled with toxicity. Breaks are good sometimes!\n\n\u2022A positive self-talk - May it be for 15 mins this positive affirmations or self-introspection can help you deal with the stress.\n\n\u2022Journaling - Good thoughts 💭 which probably if you ever read again would make you smile or motivate you :)\n\n\u2022Be your own best friend - Ask yourself if your best friend could have felt low \u2018what would you tell her?\u2019 . Tell yourself the same things .\n\n\u2022Reverse bucket list \u2013 Not a list of what to do things but a list of what you have achieved till now. It can be a small thing like planting a tree or making a donation, or it can be as big as cracking a job interview. Celebrating these small success or looking back on them will help you surely feel confident to deal with bigger challenges of life. \n\nSelf-love isn\u2019t about always feeling good. It\u2019s about knowing you are worthy even when you\u2019re not feeling good.\n.\n.\n.\nHashtags section: \n#HappinessIsAChoice #SelfTalk #SelfLove #SmileMore #Gratitude #Journaling #CelebrateYourself #Motivatation #WednesdayWisdom #BestFriend #Pandemic2020 #InstaGood #Love #YouAreWorthIt","NumberOfLikes":281,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Manasi on August 26, 2020.

From the worldwide impact on football activities due to the Covid-19 Pandemic, to the record setting results we witnessed once the competitions restarted, this year's tournaments are surely memorable. \n\nOne major change to this year's tournaments was the decision to restart the games in single match knockout ties at neutral venues, starting with the quarter-finals.\n\nThe decision to restart the leagues without the typical home and away matches was due to the impact the corona virus pandemic had on the competitions. Due to the delays in restarting the tournaments, the concerns over the risk of infection, and travel restrictions across Europe, the organizers decided to play the remaining games in single match elimination format on neutral venues located in the country designated to host the finals.\n\nThis resulted in all remaining Europa League matches being played in single match knockout ties at neutral venues in Germany, while all remaining Champions League single match knockout ties were played at neutral venues in Portugal.\n\nTournament organizers are now considering whether to keep playing future games using the single match knockout ties at neutral venues format starting at the quarter-final stage.\n\nThough single match knockout ties may seem like an entertaining way to watch the tournament for many, and potentially fewer games will keep players more refreshed during the competition, the financial implications may in the end prove to be the deciding factor in their decision.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n#soccerposts90 #championsleague #europaleague #football #soccer #uefa #fifa #bayernmunich\n#psg #sevilla #intermilan #soccerposts #gol #goal #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":4,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598421064,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 26 07:51:04 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Remember that time local businesses banded together to support small businesses who are doing it tough?","NumberOfLikes":12,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @covid_captures in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

It\u2019s even more challenging these days. Can you believe it? It\u2019s always been difficult, intense, exhausting. Now, like in infancy, it\u2019s once again nearly constant. And I am once again far less confident in my decision-making. The needs and worries are different but no less consuming. Maybe more so because it\u2019s all...well, novel...and there are few reliable authorities to consult. I do my best but I\u2019m nowhere near perfect and I know they need more. We\u2019re going to start school, despite my anxieties. It\u2019s another level of stress but I feel like I\u2019m holding them back if we don\u2019t try and who knows how long this goes on, who knows how much they\u2019ll miss. Our school district is smaller than most out here and our community has been hit less hard and NY is doing so well in general and I\u2019ve done a lot of reading and research that indicates there\u2019s a good chance it can go well if all the proper precautions are in place and I\u2019m worried but encouraged.

I will say doing for the gram sounds better than did it for the tik tok. My explore page is officially a mystery. For months now I haven\u2019t been able to make sense of it. I do understand this though. Not exactly the same but I am one of those that once replied all in a work email that included everyone including my boss. the director of the department, and all others. It was similar to this in that you could say I was taking shit but also it was something many could understand. I expected to get fired immediately, I had seen it done to others. Instead even my boss said it was fine when I mentioned it. Oddly everything was fine at my job after that until I started to get serious about getting some answers as to WTF was happening that my daughter was getting abused and not just no one wanted to talk about it, they also were making it seem as if there was nothing to talk about. You know what it\u2019s like to sit in front of your boss who somehow isn\u2019t mentioning the time I \u201Creplied all\u201D or any of the other things that could possibly be valid reasons to fire me.

The cloth mask has been temporarily replaced with a lavender mud mask of course.\n\nI tested positive for COVID-19 and I have experienced a roller coaster of emotions over the last few days. It\u2019s been overwhelming and frustrating to say the least.\n\nFirst, I guess I wanted to extend a thank you to everyone who has known, and reached out to check in or offer solace or sympathy. I have kept this very private due to the stigma, magnitude, and seriousness of this diagnosis. I still plan to maintain a level of privacy as I go through the motions.\n\nWhat may or may not come as a surprise is that fact that I am mainly asymptotic. I was not aware I had COVID and was tested as a precaution. The symptoms I have experienced during the latter half of the virus include:\nRandom and Intense tiredness\nMalaise (no active cough, fever, chills, or aches)\nI\u2019ve experienced maybe one or two headaches (I\u2019ve attributed to stress )\n\nWhat\u2019s been the most rattling is knowing I caught the virus while taking precautions and following protocol. (This is not an invitation for anyone to debate whether the protocols put in place work or are real) it\u2019s just frustrating that there are people out there being negligent with their actions and could be putting others in danger. But, enough of the victim mentality... I am happy and well. \n\nAs I conclude this public service announcement I want to stress how important it is for everyone to follow prevention measures and to think about others with respect to any and all illness. It\u2019s not about me... or you... it\u2019s about trying to prevent harm to others.\nI could have easily not gone to get tested and parade around as if everything was fine putting EVERYONE in my circle in harm.\n\n\u2014-> Whether or not you believe in karma, I am thinking there\u2019s a reason for everything - with a consequence whether positive or negative. With every action is a reaction. I am not sure what this year is trying to provide for me but I am excited to see the abundance I receive.\n\nBe safe everyone.","NumberOfLikes":104,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Britt Hildy in Los Angeles, California with @datshawtyshort.
