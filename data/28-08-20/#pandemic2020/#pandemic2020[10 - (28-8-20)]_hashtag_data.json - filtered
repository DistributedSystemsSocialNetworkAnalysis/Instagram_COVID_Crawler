I debated if there could be such a thing. How could positivity EVER be toxic?? It most certainly can be and we are probably all guilty of it. People typically mean well when doing it. But now that I'm aware I had to do a self check and need to apologize to some folk. \u2063\n\u2063\nIn a world of social media posts touting \"Good vibes only\" and \"No negative energy\" this has somehow become law. However this is an unrealisric approach to the legitimate negative emotions and mental health issues faced by ourselves and others on a daily basis. \u2063\n\u2063\nWe all know toxic individuals or people who are negative in the most positive and ideal situations. These people aren't good for us. These aren't the folks I'm talking about. Pretending like negative emotions and mental health issues dont exist outside of these individuals, especially now and judging yourself or others for it is not healthy. Negative emotions and mental health issues aren't vibes. They're a daily fact of life. Living and interacting with others will not always be rainbows and unicorns. The totality of anyone includes negative emotion. \u2063\n\u2063\nThe Black community has notoriously ignored mental health issues and have made it often a misunderstood, ridiculed, embarrassing, and shameful subject to discuss. Its not. There is nothing wrong with not being ok and it'll look different for everyone. \u2063\n\u2063\nDuring Covid-19 mental health issues and suicide rates have skyrocketed. Feelings of loneliness and isolation are pushing people to the brink. \u2063\n\u2063\nThe phrase \"This isn't about you and no one owes you shit\" couldn't be truer. Everyone is going through it, struggling to cope and trying to hold on as best they can. As a community we've got to stop taking people's responses to mental health issues or negative emotions personal. Grace, compassion, and mercy is overdue. \u2063\n\u2063\nBlack women have unfairly been denied their negative emotions and told to be strong to superhuman levels. This has resulted in an increase in health issues including cardiac disease and stroke. \n\nContinued on last slide.","NumberOfLikes":2,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1596473540,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 03 18:52:20 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"phenomenalkeesh","CaptionText":"Good afternoon family y'all ok?

If not check out the Netflix documentary Filthy Rich. \u2063\n\u2063\nVictims allege not all affiliated with Epstein and Maxwell participated in the rape and victimization of girls, some as young as age 12. But many are said to be involved and fully aware of what went on. Weinstein and Prince Andrew, Duke of York are among the implicated. \u2063\n\u2063\nA 2002 Trump quote I find interesting: \u201CI\u2019ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He\u2019s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.\u201D I find this alarming considering this is the same man to sexuslize his own daughter Ivanka in a 2006 appearence on The View. He stated he'd date her if she wasn't his daughter. \u2063\n\u2063\nTo distance himself from the nortorius pedophile in 2019 Trump says of Epstein: \"I had a falling out a long time ago with him,\" I don't think I've spoken to him in 15 years. I was not a fan of his.\" \u2063\n\u2063\nJust last Tuesday he wished Ghislaine the best when asked about her arrest and upcoming trail. Ghislaine has been referred to as Epstein's pimp. Its been alleged that she'd recruit children, groom them, gain their trust and attempt to normalize sexual abuse while participating in the repeated molestations. Victims have referred to her as being equally as wicked and complicit as Epstein. All allegations she denies. \u2063\n\u2063\nI'm curious how long our need for beautiful lies will keep our heads in the sand because we are unwilling to face a disgusting truth. The most horrible thing I see is the victim blaming and willingness to turn a blind eye. I saw this story around 2012 and wondered why Epstein's face wasn't plastered everywhere. Then I learned Trump's former Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta and The Federal Government broke the law and entered into a 2008 illegal plea deal with Jeffery Epstein. This deal violated the Crime Victims Rights Act. Short and sweet almost no jail time, no admission of pedophilia, and no one saw it coming. \u2063","NumberOfLikes":1,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by PhenomenalKeesh on July 27, 2020.

The fish was a little dry (and chewy) and the chicken wasn't as tender as we had hoped.\n.\nFor mains, as you can see from the photo, there was plenty to go around. The spices in the curries were well put together and the naan was delicious. The mains really did make up for a poorer start. The plates of rice were of a rather delicate portion in comparison to the significant sauce provided by the various curries. This however, really left us too full for a third course!\n.\nOverall, as a family we enjoyed the food at the local Indian, however were a little disappointed with the lack of social distancing with the tables and lengthy wait times between the starters and main course. Understandibly, this is a \"cosy restaurant\" however, we were just 30cm from adjacent customer tables. All members of staff did not exhibit any form of PPE when serving or handling food and payment was a little tricky as there seemed to be a large number of exchanges of cards\/bills\/machines unnessarily. There was also a discrepancy with the bill, as it seemed there were hidden \"add-ons\" and charges which were not made known on arrival\/ordering. There are a few areas we feel TAJ MAHAL could consider looking into, particularly admist the current pandemic in order to ease the safety of their customers, however still an adequately pleasent experience. \n.\n. \n#pandemic2020 #stayhome #foodielife #eatingout #foodiephied #dietstartsmonday #carbs #eatingin #indianfood #takeout #ubereats #curry #socialdistancing #foodiephiedlove #ForTheLoveOfFood #ketomeals #ketorecipes #ketoweightloss #ketobreakfast #process #protein #proteinshake #cupcakes #gymtime #workaholic #workout #fuelyourbody","NumberOfLikes":6,"Hashtags":["#pandemic2020","#stayhome","#foodielife","#eatingout","#foodiephied","#dietstartsmonday","#carbs","#eatingin","#indianfood","#takeout","#ubereats","#curry","#socialdistancing","#foodiephiedlove","#ForTheLoveOfFood","#ketomeals","#ketorecipes","#ketoweightloss","#ketobreakfast","#process","#protein","#proteinshake","#cupcakes","#gymtime","#workaholic","#workout","#fuelyourbody"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by 𝙵𝚘𝚛 𝚃𝚑𝚎 𝙻𝚘𝚟𝚎 𝙾𝚏 𝙵𝚘𝚘𝚍 in Taj Mahal.

My sis is driving me down, which is pretty cool 😎 I had a heart-to-heart with her which came out of the blue (but really, we all know these things build up inside of us until it hits a crunch-point!) It feels much lighter inside when you open up to someone you trust. Also, we joked about worst case scenarios, which actually made me feel better! 😂 \n⠀\n\u2022Have you got any tips for prepping for an operation?

I was going to just let it go and take a break from it. But, maybe that\u2019s not the answer. Maybe I should explain. \n\nYou see- some of us are still out here worrying about a pandemic. Worrying about getting exposed. Worried about infecting our loved ones. Worrying for our patients. Worrying about the fall and winter hospital capacity. Trying to ignore the recruiting emails to go to Texas and Florida to work 70 hour weeks because they are so desperate. \n\nYou see- some of us are still wearing masks for 8-12 hours straight and not eating or drinking on shift. I was running around the department on my last overnight shift and finally reached a point where I started dry heaving. I went in the doc box, ripped off the mask and took 30 seconds to catch my breath and then I put the mask back on and put a chest tube in someone at 4AM. \n\nYou see- that patient I was worried about dying? The one who looked me in the eyes before I intubated him and was terrified? He did die. Took awhile. But he\u2019s gone now. Just like I thought he would be. He wasn\u2019t the only patient I lost these past few months from COVID. \n\nYou see- we had an entire family line up outside of the ambulance bay to see their intubated loved one be transferred to another hospital. They hadn\u2019t seen him in a month. \n\nYou see- every black patient I\u2019ve encountered in the last few months I\u2019ve been especially worried about how to protect them and be the best healthcare advocate I can for them because the truth is it took a civil rights movement to remind me that their lives matter just as much as white lives. That\u2019s the truth. I wasn\u2019t advocating equally even if I thought I was. \n\nYou see- every time I tell someone how I\u2019m really doing or what\u2019s really on my mind I can see the uncomfortable look on their face, shifting their weight while looking for the fastest way out of the conversation. \n\nContinued in the comments","NumberOfLikes":51,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1596509275,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 04 04:47:55 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"knowledge_bank26","CaptionText":"#DailyUpdates #currentevents #currentaffairs #morning #follow #goodday #bless #love #life #India #hindustan #bharat #covid19 #lockdown2020 #pandemic2020 #narendramodi_primeminister #Post #Update #family #frndz #motivation\n\nFollow👇👇\n@knowledge_bank26 \nFollow👆👆","NumberOfLikes":15,"Hashtags":["#DailyUpdates","#currentevents","#currentaffairs","#morning","#follow","#goodday","#bless","#love","#life","#India","#hindustan","#bharat","#covid19","#lockdown2020","#pandemic2020","#narendramodi_primeminister","#Post","#Update","#family","#frndz","#motivation"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by knowledge_bank on August 03, 2020.

We got into Times Square, recorded one take, it was exhilarating, emotional, we were sweating it was HOT, I could dance - with so many beautiful people - and with space! Trying to embrace many unexpected emotions and then as we were preparing to do it again; I looked up and saw a massive portrait of John Lewis looking back at me with the quote \u201Cnever lose that sense of hope\u201D. \n\nIt literally took the air out of my lungs. I was transported to another place, completely losing track of what I was doing, screwed up the choreography and everything lol. The last time I truly danced like this I was a very different person, I was less educated, less informed, and completely engulfed in our abnormal unique theater lives. Staring at Mr. John Lewis knowing what I\u2019ve learnt, and knowing that my learning and listening to Black voices continues everyday for forever, dancing to the song that I instantly associate with a time back in Aus where New York was a wild dream of mine, and now connecting it all dancing in this present moment was overwhelming and so wildly special. Sure I miss Performing, sure I miss getting to tell stories, sure I miss the exhilaration of live audiences, but knowing that when we return we will be reconstructing and rebuilding the system within the industry as a whole but also our community filled me with hope. The energy we created in Times Square was electric - it made me think \u201Chow incredible will it be when every person dancing\/acting\/singing through telling stories has the opportunity to feel this way?\u201D It will be unlike anything I can describe. My soul got a little refueling, my purpose became even more distinct, both a rewarding and humbling couple hours dancing in Times Square for which I am very grateful. 🌏\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nI DO NOT OWN THE RIGHTS TO THIS MUSIC \n🎶\u2019Empire State of Mind\u2019 - @aliciakeys \n.\n.\nthank you @jenavanel for making this possible.

A few things you can do:\u2060\n\u2060\n1️\u20E3 Shift your expectations. You are not parenting in optimal circumstances, therefore, you cannot expect to be excelling in any area\u2060\n\u2060\n2️\u20E3 Know that each day you can choose one area to give more to (i.e., keeping the home clean, caring for your children, getting work tasks done, etc.) but you can't do it all at once\u2060\n\u2060\n3️\u20E3 When your brain tells you that you \"should\" be doing more, challenge these thoughts. Who says you should? Would you tell a close friend the same thing?\u2060\n\u2060\n4️\u20E3 Write it down in one central location. You won't be able to remember it all so keep a visible list that does not move (this way it won't get lost)\u2060\n\u2060\n5️\u20E3 Take 5-minute breaks often. What if you went outside and let the sun touch your skin for 5 minutes each hour and did absolutely nothing? Try it.\u2060\n\u2060\n6️\u20E3 Set a cleaning timer. I like to set my kitchen timer for 30 minutes and shout at everyone in the house and tell them we have to clean as fast as we can like our life depends on it. No, it doesn't all get cleaned, but it feels good to work together toward a common goal.\u2060\n\u2060\n7️\u20E3 Affirm yourself. You are doing the unthinkable with little-to-no support. You deserve praise, not guilt. If you're not doing the job you think you should be doing...guess what? None of us are.\u2060\n\u2060\nWe WILL get through this one moment at a time. \u2060\n\u2060\nDoes any of this hit home for you? What has been helpful for you during this time?\u2060\n.\u2060\n.\u2060\n.\u2060\n.\u2060\n.\u2060\n.","NumberOfLikes":7,"Hashtags":["#pandemic2020","#momingishard","#Repost"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Melissa on August 03, 2020.

We currently live in a state that has a very \u201Cyoung and healthy\u201D mindset. Mask wearing was presented as a suggestion for a long time. Now there is a mandate, but we are also holding parades and brunches, and concerts. All while socially distancing of course!  Well let me tell you something, the two cannot go hand in hand. I\u2019m not one to wave the \u201CI have a degree in public health,\u201D but look, I HAVE A DEGREE IN PUBLIC HEALTH, and we are all shaking our damn heads at your engagement parties and brunches.

While you all are able to \u201Cescape to the mountains for a bit,\u201D there are people who don\u2019t even have a way to GET TO THE HOSPITAL if they have COVID. People are missing preventative healthcare appointments because they are too scared to take a Lyft. And do you know why we are not joining you for brunch or your \u201Cparty, with precautions?\u201D Because AMERICA IS RATIONING HEALTHCARE. AND WE ARE NOT ON THE LIST. We have to scream and yell to get our wishes granted in the hospital on a good day. In the current state? Forget it. PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ARE WRITING THEIR WISHES ON THEIR ARMS. WE ARE NOT ON THE LIST OF PEOPLE WHO WILL GET A VENTILATOR BECAUSE A MEDICAL RESIDENT DOESN\u2019T THINK OUR QUALITY OF LIFE IS THE SAME AS SOMEONE WHO CAN HIKE A MOUNTAIN. ONCE OUR VOICE IS GONE\u2026. WE MAY NOT SURVIVE. So yea. I miss my friends, I miss my family, I MISS BRUNCH ALSO. But until further notice, we have no choice. And guess what?  We are left behind. There are no more virtual shows, or beer tastings.  The resources have gone to those who are privileged enough to put their health at risk, cause they might get a ventilator. People are over virtual happy hours, because patios are open.  So yea. Please understand that I might be a bit hurt and resentful when I see you out socializing without masks.

Before you can begin anything, you need to be honest  with yourself and ask yourself what are the reasons today...right now that you are unable to get your workout done. \n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nThese are going to be tough questions with tough answers. the idea here is that once you have identified what limiting triggers are...you can then address them. \n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n*Next up, making sure the program you are doing fits your needs and your schedule. Don't just join your favorite IG Fitness coach and they do Advanced level step at 2am....sis..that don't even make sense.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nHow can you commit to something that not only doesn't fit into your current schedule but also something that your body isn't ready to do. Maybe your starting point is 15 mins of active walking. in three weeks it will be 30. A mistake I've made in the past has been thinking i can just dive into something. that causes injuries and then also sets me back. \n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nThis time around i have been taking it slow and steady and its been so beneficial to the point where i am attempting two a days!!! its been years since i have don't that!\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n*Finally, select a program that you can complete and that is fun.

After school break the world seemed to have erupted into a social consciousness from BIPOC issues, to the government we choose (because,  we do choose them every time we vote or don't vote) to health care or lack there of and people just being selfish and\/or unconscious of basic human decency, it was just too much.\n\nI still came to insta, shared some stories but that was it. \n\nI had a lot of time to think about my roll in this insane ocean of information and misinformation that floats around the world and have decided to minimize the negative stories I share, by this I mean that when something is wrong in the world we know it, we don't need  the internet to tell us a million times, so my role will be a bit different, because the people that I follow and that follow me are pretty good in being informed anyways, you don't need me for that.\n\nWhat I wil try tol do is share solutions, which is why I started this in the first place, to tell you things that I wish other mothers would have told me. So if I'm interested in sharing info on BIPOC than instead of sharing the news piece thats been circulating everywhere, I will share diversity books, games, teachable opportunities, other accounts, or ry to have a fun mother to mother discussion here on what can be teach our kids so history doesn't keep repeating itself.\n\nSo thanks you for following, thanks for the new followers who hoped on this train during the last 3 weeks and I hope that what I share is fun and useful for you guys.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#summer2020 #2020 #pandemic2020 #socialdistancing #vacation #break #iwasonabreak #motherhood #moms #momgoals #communication #messeges #instagram #sharing #stories #love #humanity #history","NumberOfLikes":16,"Hashtags":["#summer2020","#2020","#pandemic2020","#socialdistancing","#vacation","#break","#iwasonabreak","#motherhood","#moms","#momgoals","#communication","#messeges","#instagram","#sharing","#stories","#love","#humanity","#history"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Sofia Aceves | SD \/ TJ on August 03, 2020.

I\u2019m tired, scared, bitter, angry and hateful! If you don\u2019t think you are racist, then go and educate yourself as to why it can\u2019t be \u201Call lives matter\u201D! Also why \u201Cblue lives matter\u201D doesn\u2019t work either! My husband had pointed out there isn\u2019t anything for nurses (that we are aware of), but he doesn\u2019t expect or want there to be! This is his job and the job he chose to do, to treat patients, even those he doesn\u2019t like. He gets called the N word and f*ggot by his patients! He\u2019s also been stopped by police because the color of his skin and very wrong identification (on his way to work). Even so he will still care for those people with no hesitation! P.S. his job has become life threatening too, no thanks to asshole #POTUS!  This is their job! NOT their job to step on someone\u2019s neck, to profile someone because of their skin color! To murder someone\u2019s son or daughter because they were black and\/or wore a fukking hoody. Educate yourself about why BLM and not the other! We need to do better! I\u2019ve stayed quiet for awhile and will continue, unless I see something wrong! But I will leave this repost from #genebaur here! If this offends you don\u2019t comment, please just block me! I\u2019m tired 😪! Oh and please #vote and donate, this country can\u2019t survive another lost to 45!

Once that is achieved, isolation can set in. One way to avoid this is to keep them busy in different meaningful activities and instill a sense of purpose in their lives. Introducing a community project or a hobby they can indulge in, exploring relevant volunteering opportunities, or setting up some teaching and mentoring engagements where they can impart valuable lessons to the younger generation, for example, can be beneficial.\n\n Be Sensitive to Vision or Hearing Challenges\n\nGenerally, elders feel self-conscious because of hearing or vision-related challenges, especially in social settings. Hence, you must be extra-sensitive to their needs and help them come to terms with their challenge(s) without them feeling left out. Encourage assistive technology wherever possible; after all, technology exists to make our lives easier, so why not give Aditum's cool AI apps (like Laila) or the latest hearing aid devices a go?\n\n Organize Frequent Social Activities\nNothing livens us up like meeting our loved ones and spending quality time with them. You can help break the monotony of routine activities in a senior's life and give them something to look forward to by encouraging them to meet their relatives, friends and family regularly.

This whole pandemic thing sucks! No one likes wearing a mask. It feels painfully awkward and unnatural to spend time with someone while remaining vigilant about staying 6 ft or more apart. I also don\u2019t want to live in fear, but there\u2019s a big difference between \u201Cliving in fear\u201D and being a responsible member of society.\n\u2022\nThis isn\u2019t about you.

Have you always homeschooled or do you do public\/private school? \nProbably the first 1-2 months I was doing the the homeschool on my own which was hard. Since my husband is gone, it was all up to me to homeschool Agnesse while taking care of a newborn and 2 year old. Some days were almost impossible but we got through it. \nIf you\u2019ve been following me for awhile you know that Agnesse has ADHD and a learning disability which. Is very challenging. Unfortunately the school did not do a good job at helping kids with disabilities at home. She has an IEP and we didn\u2019t hear from her spec ed teacher once and she was held to the same standards as her peers who do not have a disability which made it very difficult. There wasn\u2019t a curriculum set for these kids so it made it hard and we ended up having to do our own thing because she obviously couldn\u2019t keep up. \nLuckily my mom offered to do homeschool with her 3 days a week because I was really struggling. I\u2019m so grateful for her help and support. She taught Agnesse how to read which is huge for her. In February, Agnesses reading skills were at a pre school level and she\u2019s probably almost to a first grade level now. She\u2019ll be in 2nd grade this year! \nI\u2019ve been enjoying the time with the kids and we\u2019ve been spending a lot of time outdoors exploring and playing in water. I highly recommend art projects or science experiments daily and then daily walks if it\u2019s not to hot and you\u2019re able. I try to find anything I can around the house to keep them busy. \nFor my own mental sanity, I need to keep them busy. The world is a scary weird place right now and I try not to think about it. Focusing on my family and getting through each day has helped me the most. Mama, take care of yourself. Take a break when needed. If you need to put the kids in front of a screen so you can have a minute. Do it and don\u2019t feel guilty. Your kids need their mom to be healthy more than anything right now ❤️\n.\n.\n.\n#momsofinstagram #parentingduringapandemic #pandemic2020 #momdiaries #motherhoodmoments #honestmotherhood #momssupportingmoms #thisismotherhood #pandemicmom #homeschooling #mentalhealth","NumberOfLikes":45,"Hashtags":["#momsofinstagram","#parentingduringapandemic","#pandemic2020","#momdiaries","#motherhoodmoments","#honestmotherhood","#momssupportingmoms","#thisismotherhood","#pandemicmom","#homeschooling","#mentalhealth"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Melissa on August 02, 2020.

LOL So, for today\u2019s stop on my pandemic Hollywood tour we\u2019re visiting the Villanueva house from the hit TV series \u201CJane the Virgin\u201D! \n\nEven though the series was supposed to take place in South Florida, the Villanueva single family home, built in 1923, is actually located at \u202A580 N Beachwood Drive\u202C in the heart of Hollywood ! As you can see, the home\u2019s Art Deco \/ Spanish Colonial architecture makes it look like a pretty good facsimile of a Hialeah casita in sunny Miami. Right? Please note that this is a private residence so if you visit please do not trespass or disturb the people that live there.\n\nThis romantic, dramedy and satirical telenovela - which was a loose adaptation of the Venezuelan telenovela \u201CJuana la Virgen\u201D - ran on The CW Network from 2014 to 2019. If you haven\u2019t seen it yet, the series details the surprising and dramatic events that take place in the life of Jane Gloriana Villanueva (Gina Rodriguez), a devout 23-year-old Latina virgin, who becomes pregnant after an accidental artificial insemination by her gynecologist! If you want to know what happens next...Netflix is currently streaming the entire series for you to enjoy! \n\nFun facts - While the Villanueva family came from Venezuela to the US, all 3 actresses - Gina Rodriguez (Jane), Andrea Navedo (Xiomara) and Ivonne Coll (Alba) - are of Puerto Rican background! WEPA! BORICUAS IN DA HOUSE!! 🇵🇷\n\nIn real life Andrea Navedo (Xo) is only 7 years older than Gina Rodriguez (Jane). They play mother and daughter on the show. Navedo\u2019s character was 16 when she became pregnant with Rodriguez's character.\n\nJaime Camil, who plays Rogelio de la Vega (the famous telenovela star who is very self-centered with a high ego) on the series is originally from Mexico and believe it or not he is an actual telenovela star who has worked on dozens of telenovelas. His most famous one is \u201CLa Fea Mas Bella\u201D (the series that inspired Ugly Betty)! #filminglocation #tvseries #janethevirgin #ginarodriguez #jaimecamil #andreanavedo #ivonnecoll #notinmiami  #hollywoodtour #pandemic2020 #socialdistancing #wearamask #tonymiros","NumberOfLikes":141,"Hashtags":["#filminglocation","#tvseries","#janethevirgin","#ginarodriguez","#jaimecamil","#andreanavedo","#ivonnecoll","#notinmiami","#hollywoodtour","#pandemic2020","#socialdistancing","#wearamask","#tonymiros"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1596392651,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 02 20:24:11 CEST 2020","Location":"Hollywood, California"},{"Owner":"abgifts_boxes","CaptionText":"She loves it shiny and some sweet smile..\n.\n\n#corporategift #lagoslove #absgiftboxes #lagoabizwomen #Lagosgiftstore #explorelife #explorepage #giftwrapping #ashantylove #trunkboxeslagos #souvenir #kitchenlove #souvenirspackage #giftideas #leatherboxes #foreverthinking #buygiftlagos #healthyway #live #foodgifts #shine #glitter #unique-gifts #thoughtful-gifts #ashantylagos #gifthampers #Pandemic2020 #lockherlove","NumberOfLikes":3,"Hashtags":["#corporategift","#lagoslove","#absgiftboxes","#lagoabizwomen","#Lagosgiftstore","#explorelife","#explorepage","#giftwrapping","#ashantylove","#trunkboxeslagos","#souvenir","#kitchenlove","#souvenirspackage","#giftideas","#leatherboxes","#foreverthinking","#buygiftlagos","#healthyway","#live","#foodgifts","#shine","#glitter","#unique-gifts","#thoughtful-gifts","#ashantylagos","#gifthampers","#Pandemic2020","#lockherlove"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ABGIFTS & BOXES on August 02, 2020.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1596392645,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 02 20:24:05 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"abgifts_boxes","CaptionText":"Be brave always.

InterDigital alleges unauthorised use of five cellular 3G and 4G patents and three H.265\/HEVC (high efficiency video coding) patents by the Chinese phonemaker. InterDigital claims it has been in negotiation with Xiaomi for years and filed the case after they couldn't reach an agreement. Mint has reached out to Xiaomi for comments on the matter. The US company is seeking compensatory and punitive damages against Xiaomi along with an injunction to prevent further infringement in India, unless Xiaomi agrees to a FRAND (fair, reasonable, and non- discriminatory) license determined by the court.\nInterDigital's Indian patents on the cellular side that are in contention include solutions which enhance utilisation of cellular resources for applications (such as VoIP) which require continuous allocations of uplink resources. The other patents allow mobile phone users quick and efficient access to 4G (LTE) networks and reduce power consumption by selectively switching the handset's LTE modem to sleep mode. The patents related to videos include an enhanced video decoder, which reduces the network resources required to deliver videos while reducing the memory needed to store videos on the handset, resulting in improved video streaming experience. The other solution enhances picture quality for a decoded video by providing a series of filters.\n\nRead more at www.thelawkit.com\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#legalupdates #legalnews #law\n#judiciales #lawstudents #lawyers #advocates #professional #courtroom #litigator #lawcollege #elearning #education #academics #pandemic2020 #lockdownlife","NumberOfLikes":18,"Hashtags":["#legalupdates","#legalnews","#law","#judiciales","#lawstudents","#lawyers","#advocates","#professional","#courtroom","#litigator","#lawcollege","#elearning","#education","#academics","#pandemic2020","#lockdownlife"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The LawKit on August 02, 2020.

He told them many parables to lead them to understand what the kingdom of heaven is, and the disciple\u2019s role in making it happen. In today\u2019s portion, the disciples lamentably failed, like a person who understands the theory but cannot apply it in practice. 15 When it was evening, the disciples came to him and said, \u201CThis is a deserted place, and the hour is now late; send the crowds away so that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves.\u201D 16 Jesus said to them, \u201CThey need not go away; you give them something to eat.\u201D 17 They replied, \u201CWe have nothing here but five loaves and two fish.\u201D\n\nTo read more cut and paste link below:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/notes\/st-augustines-episcopal-church\/between-theory-and-practice-what-we-must-do-as-disciples\/3440976235926877\/\n\n#churchonline#churchfamily \n#community#les \n#discussion #church\n#sundayservice\n#covid19#togetherapart \n#pandemic2020#episcopal \n#episcopalchurch#service \n#staysafe#disiples \n#lowereastside#transformation \n#historicalchurch#comevisit \n#slavegalleries#history \n#theoryandpractice#rector","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#churchonlin","#churchfamily","#communit","#les","#discussion","#church","#sundayservice","#covid1","#togetherapart","#pandemic202","#episcopal","#episcopalchurc","#service","#staysaf","#disiples","#lowereastsid","#transformation","#historicalchurc","#comevisit","#slavegallerie","#history","#theoryandpractic","#rector"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1596382838,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 02 17:40:38 CEST 2020","Location":"St Augustine's Episcopal Church"},{"Owner":"deardiary_pandemic","CaptionText":"The moon. \n.. \n.. \n.. \n#pandemicart\n#pandemiclife \n#pandemic2020 \n#pandemic \n#pandemicpoetry\n#writersofinstagram \n#writerlife\n#zines \n#zinester\n#zinestagram \n#wordsmatter\n#wordsgasm \n#deardiary\n#pandemicdiary","NumberOfLikes":9,"Hashtags":["#pandemicart","#pandemiclife","#pandemic2020","#pandemic","#pandemicpoetry","#writersofinstagram","#writerlife","#zines","#zinester","#zinestagram","#wordsmatter","#wordsgasm","#deardiary","#pandemicdiary"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Dear Diary on August 02, 2020.
