Zoe despertó como a las 8:30, bajo con el papi por su leche y se quedó conmigo mientras el papi se cambió para ir hacer ejercicio en su bicicleta. Cuando Zoe terminó su leche nos alistamos para bajar hacer el desayuno y comenzar a comer, Zoe casi terminaba cuando llegó el papi, terminaron de desayunar juntos en lo que yo estaba preparando unas cosas para nuestra comida de la tarde. Cuando terminaron salieron a jugar un rato en lo que yo terminaba de hacerlo que que estaba haciendo. Después salí con ellos y el papi aprovechó para terminar de hacer unas cosas del jardín en lo que yo le cambié el color de uñas a Zoe, al terminar entramos a que durmiera su siesta. Cuando se quedó dormida baje a termina de preparar lo que necesitábamos y salí a recoger una deliciosa carne al pastor que una amiga me hizo favor de recoger más temprano. Al regresar Zoe seguía dormida y el papi bajo un ratito después a poner el carbón en el asador. Comenzamos a azar las cosas en lo que llegaban un amigo\/compañero de Rodrigo con su esposa\/amiga y su hijo a comer\/cenar. A pesar de que estaba lloviznando comimos muy a gusto. Nos la pasamos muy bien y comimos delicioso. Zoe estaba muy contenta de estar jugando con su hijo, que es mucho mayor que ella, pero aún así jugaron. Cuando se fueron y terminamos de recoger las cosas de la cocina subimos a prepararnos para dormir.\n\n#zoedemicorazon🐥 #recolectandomomentos #staysafeathome #fighting👑🦠 #motherhoodincovid19 #SocialDistancing #FlattentheCurve #stayhomechallenge #stayhomesafelifes #pandemic2020 #quaranteam","NumberOfLikes":11,"Hashtags":["#zoedemicorazon🐥","#recolectandomomentos","#staysafeathome","#fighting👑🦠","#motherhoodincovid19","#SocialDistancing","#FlattentheCurve","#stayhomechallenge","#stayhomesafelifes","#pandemic2020","#quaranteam"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1596342065,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 02 06:21:05 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"We on level 8 now y\u2019all 😭 going in like \u201CI EAT THOOOOSE\u201D #2020 #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":21,"Hashtags":["#2020","#pandemic2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Ya Local Hood Therapist 🥃 on August 01, 2020.

New beginning. New adventures. New challenges. Hello August!\n\nWe are now going into 6 months of isolation and quarantine.  At least for our family, for our own safety, health, and mental sanity we are still currently keeping our social distance.  At this point I stopped caring about being thought of as paranoid and crazy because the alternative would be exposing ourselves to something we don\u2019t know how our bodies will respond to.\n\nWith that in mind, Joel and I are now facing a difficult decision for the coming school year. Do we send our Tiny Human to JK? How do we know it\u2019s safe? How do you social distance a kindergarten class of 30+ 4 year olds who have been isolated from their peers for half a year? How do we expect these poor teachers to teach our children while worrying about who may be sick in their classes?  And would your 4 year old really keep their mask on in class for the duration of the day? I know my daughter would be over it probably in an hour or two, or until she gets amply distracted or bothered by this thing over her mouth and nose.\n\nHowever, on the flip side, I also understand that there are families with no other choice but to send their kids to school. Parents, like us who have a kid on the spectrum that need the social interaction with their peers that they can avail of being in a class full of children their age.\n\nI don\u2019t know about everyone else but I am stuck between a rock and a hard place. To be candid, I really don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do.....at least not yet.\n\nHow about you, are you ready to send your kids back to school?\n\n#lifeinthetimeofcovid #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife","NumberOfLikes":22,"Hashtags":["#lifeinthetimeofcovid","#pandemic2020","#pandemiclife"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Lily Obien in Whitby, Ontario with @mr2damrsobien.

We were in quarantine for 6 months after we brought him home from the NICU at 3 1\/2 months old. Quarantine is not new to us but this one is so different. I miss my bigs. I miss them so much it hurts. But I am so proud of them for navigating through these last few months without their momma. They have both dealt with Covid, one was furloughed, one bought a house. I miss my mom, my sister and the rest of our families but I am so thankful that they all understand why we are in our bubble. All to keep the little red boat captain well. \n#chd #heartdisease #chdawareness #heartdiseaseawareness #congenitalheartdisease #congenitaljunctionalectopictachycardia #jet #junctionalectopictachycardia #heartbaby #heartmom #preemie #micropreemie #26weeker #nicugrad #nicu #postniculife #pandemic2020 #missingyou #momlife","NumberOfLikes":36,"Hashtags":["#chd","#heartdisease","#chdawareness","#heartdiseaseawareness","#congenitalheartdisease","#congenitaljunctionalectopictachycardia","#jet","#junctionalectopictachycardia","#heartbaby","#heartmom","#preemie","#micropreemie","#26weeker","#nicugrad","#nicu","#postniculife","#pandemic2020","#missingyou","#momlife"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":6,"Timestamp":1596335653,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 02 04:34:13 CEST 2020","Location":"Keller, Texas"},{"CaptionText":"To stop the spread of COVID-19, we all need to play our part.

Todo esse contexto social acaba abalando a saúde mental de quem está cumprindo o isolamento, e para isso, achar uma forma de se entreter tem sido um ponto fundamental.\n\n\u201CA cultura em suas diferentes manifestações, a religiosidade, as boas práticas físicas, orientais e reflexivas, se convertem, nesse tempo de confinamento e pandemia, em verdadeiros antídotos contra a agressividade e disfuncionalidades\u201D, comenta a professora. \n\nLink na bio.\n\nFonte: Jornal do Campus\n\n#covid19 #coronavirus #ONN #onovonormal #ONNpoliticapublica #covidart #covid2020, #covid19brasil #covidnews #covid19art #corona #coronavírus #coronavirusbrazil #coronavirus2020 #pandemic #pandemicart #pandemic2020, #pandemicorona #pandemiclife #yoga #corpoemente #corpomenteespirito #autocuidado #autoestima #cuidado #descanso #alongamento #yogaemcasa #pilatesemcasa","NumberOfLikes":39,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#coronavirus","#ONN","#onovonormal","#ONNpoliticapublica","#covidart","#covid2020,","#covid19brasil","#covidnews","#covid19art","#corona","#coronavírus","#coronavirusbrazil","#coronavirus2020","#pandemic","#pandemicart","#pandemic2020,","#pandemicorona","#pandemiclife","#yoga","#corpoemente","#corpomenteespirito","#autocuidado","#autoestima","#cuidado","#descanso","#alongamento","#yogaemcasa","#pilatesemcasa"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by O Novo Normal in São Paulo, Brazil.

This slim volume is backed by exhaustive data that drills down the impact to the individual level (this bears emphasis and needs to be repeated) and research which traverses time between the 19th century and the present day. His turn of phrase and a bipartisan assessment of policy by successive governments makes this a breezy and balanced read. \u2018The Gated Republic\u2019 is a must read for all who are interested in policy making or for that matter how citizens of the country have been shortchanged by failure of the government in providing fundamental services over generations. \n\n #pandemic2020 #pandemicread #bookreview #booklover #policymaking #policymakers #indianeconomy","NumberOfLikes":11,"Hashtags":["#pandemic2020","#pandemicread","#bookreview","#booklover","#policymaking","#policymakers","#indianeconomy"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Aritro Ganguly on August 01, 2020.

To give you some perspective, we have been together about 15 years, and we have both traveled extensively for work for most, if not all, of our adult lives.\n\nWe actually worried (a little) how we would be in retirement because we aren\u2019t use to being home together for extended periods. 😳\n\nThen the pandemic happens.\n\nOur lifestyles completely turned upside down (like many of you) and we are both now home full time. 😳\n\nNo travel. No gyms. Restaurants still aren\u2019t fully open in the 305. Thank G-d the golf courses opened (so Charles can get outta the house).\n\nOur weekly date nights had to change. Our travel is still pretty noon-existent, but I do foresee work trips coming in the near future for me. 💃\n\nInstead of having weekly date nights, we ended up having daily dates. 👀\n\nInstead of going out to dinner for our dates, we started working out together, pretty much every day.

Then we proceeded to nail a board pin in each point and use our hammer to nail it. \nThe pins were sharp and needed super duper 🤯🤯🤯🤯 supervision but it\u2019s high time we let them experience the real world a bit in controlled settings. \nOh yes and then (drumroll plz) M made a shark with a super long tail and a long nose (shark is Bawa it seems 🤣🤣😂🙄🙄). Again just went with the flow and let him to do it as this helped with his motor skills practice. Gave a boost to his imagination as well. \nPS: It\u2019s 100 days of S.T.E.A.M. because M detests to write and colour so hopefully the art will help in that area (fingers crossed). \nPPS : It\u2019s officially August and can\u2019t believe my baby will turn 4 on the 4th 🤷\u200D♀️🤷\u200D♀️🤷\u200D♀️🤷\u200D♀️ and yeah I still haven\u2019t started loosing weight like I promised myself in 2010 😂😂😂😂. \nWELCOME TO LEVEL 8 OF JUMANJI  #100daysofSTEAM #day1of100 #invitationtoplay #oneactivityaday #oneactivityatatime #bawibackpacker #preschoolactivities #montessori #homeschooling #pandemic2020 #pandemicparenting #tagfromtheheart #motorskills #diyactivities #finemotorskills #everydayinvitationtoplay #playtolearn #playtolearn #screentimealternatives","NumberOfLikes":28,"Hashtags":["#100daysofSTEAM","#day1of100","#invitationtoplay","#oneactivityaday","#oneactivityatatime","#bawibackpacker","#preschoolactivities","#montessori","#homeschooling","#pandemic2020","#pandemicparenting","#tagfromtheheart","#motorskills","#diyactivities","#finemotorskills","#everydayinvitationtoplay","#playtolearn","#playtolearn","#screentimealternatives"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Pinaaz Pagdiwalla on August 01, 2020.

She grew in both size and smarts... a lucky girl to be surrounded by so many exceptional people showing her the way. We got to witness my brother get married in my parents backyard, in a beautiful intimate ceremony, which never would have happened if it weren\u2019t for the pandemic. We also got to witness Dereks sister get married in a beautiful outdoor ceremony, plans the turned out better than we could have asked for. \nI\u2019m so fortunate for all the quality time as a family we had this summer and I can\u2019t thank my parents enough for taking us all in when the pandemic turned life upside down.

Last week, he got injured after falling into a drain while returning home as he was heavily drunk. He was rushed to a nearby hospital for initial treatment and was later shifted to Nagpur's Mayo Hospital.\n\nWhen he returned home after getting discharged from the hospital, he had a PPE kit.\n\nHe told his friends that it was a raincoat that he had purchased for Rs 1,000. People noticed that it wasn't a raincoat, but a PPE kit. The information was passed on to the city's health department officials, who seized the protective gear from the man and burnt it.\n\nOn being questioned, the man told the officials that he had stolen the PPE kit during his treatment at the hospital. Thereafter, officials collected his sample for COVID testing. The result came in positive. Subsequently, the officials traced and tested his primary contacts, including his family members, relatives and friends. All of them were found negative for the infection, according to a report by Sakal Times.\n\nSource: Times Now\n\n#coronavirus #covid19 #drunkman #ppekits #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":3,"Hashtags":["#coronavirus","#covid19","#drunkman","#ppekits","#pandemic2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The Vista Times on July 31, 2020.

I often say that food is my love language.  Preparing a meal is a way for me to show love to others and myself. After all, food is the fuel we run on.  So, not having access to certain foods really opened my eyes. Waiting in lines to get into a food store, made me think twice about going into those stores. I don\u2019t have hours to spare.  Who does? \n🤷🏻\u200D♀️🤷🏻\u200D♀️🤷🏻\u200D♀️\n\nLooking back now, I really feel that everything that happened is meant to be a wake up call for all of us (myself included). Many of us don\u2019t truly appreciate how we get our food. We don\u2019t even think about it. We just find it in the store waiting for us. That\u2019s not necessarily how things were meant to be. \n\nAnd now that I am living in this #newnormal I am reminded of what feels right for me.  I have gone from desperation to gratitude. Not being able to step foot into a food store has just helped my family adapt to a more sustainable way. We get our veggies from a local farm. When we \u201Crun out\u201D we get creative. And in preparation for the cold months, I am starting to freeze and jar as much as I can (yes it\u2019s only August). \n\nThe bottom line is that we are facing a reality we never thought we would be facing. The climate crisis, the pandemic, civil injustice...we are at the precipice of disaster.  We have lost our balance. We have lost sight of what\u2019s important. It\u2019s all inter-connected. Our world is crying out for help. \n\nI say keep it simple. Be kind to yourself, others, and our fragile Mother Earth. We all have the power to do something to help. I am not pushing the \u201Cvegan thing\u201D down your throats. I am just saying that eating more plants will help the collective good. (This comes from a woman who lost 20 pounds after RE-introducing meat into her diet). I love being skinny and all, but there\u2019s a MUCH bigger story to tell. More to come...if you can handle another food post 🤣🤣. \n\nPictured here is a gazpacho made with tomatoes, parsley, and scallions from @mevoearth farm. #eatlocal #growfoodnotlawns #climatecrisis #pandemic2020 #foodshortage","NumberOfLikes":29,"Hashtags":["#newnormal","#eatlocal","#growfoodnotlawns","#climatecrisis","#pandemic2020","#foodshortage"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Marissa on July 31, 2020.

I don't feel depressed (thank you doc!) just...overwhelmed. I'm wound too tight and spread too thin. I'm in constant fear of what's happening now and what is to come.

I don't know how to power through when everything seems like too much handle.\n\nI am weak. I know that. I own that. And I don't necessarily feel bad about it. I'm strong in other ways. But those aren't ways that a boss cares about. Or my bank account. Those strengths aren't \"valuable.\" And so I'm back to feeling like the only way for me to be content is to work for myself.

Here are 3 ways to embrace it 👇\n.\nYep, I am pale. Usually I love to get some color by going to the tanning salon for just a couple of weeks right before summer hits. But due to the pandemic, many tanning salons were closed.\n.\nWith my 9 to 5 work schedule, it is difficult for me to find the time to consistently apply self-tanner, let alone lay out in the sun during the day. \n.\nSo, this year I have been trying to embrace being pale, and accept the fact that I will not be donning even the lightest shade of a golden, sun-kissed glow. \n.\nI've been made fun of for being pale throughout my life. I have had a guy comment on my Facebook picture, \"You need a tan, sweetie\". I have had friends at parties throw their forearms up against me so they can talk about how much tanner they are. I have even been given the \"No offense\" phrase which preceded the words \"If I didn't go tanning I would look like you\". \n.\nBUT I am here to tell you that it is OKAY to be pale! Not just in the summer, but year-round! \n.\n1. Don't let peer pressure and product advertising make you feel like you need a tan. You don't need anything. You were born this way, baby. (As @LadyGaga would say).  \n.\n2. Remember that there are successful people who are pale! Daniel Radcliffe, Anna Kendrick,  and Emma Stone are just a few. \n.\n3. Know that some people just don't like being out of the norm, and their reaction has nothing to do with you. That's the best part about you - you don't look like everyone else 😁. \n.\nHow has the pandemic changed your beauty routine this year?Comment below!!

Como vocês estão? Espero que todos bem, se cuidando e cuidando do próximo! \nVocê sabe como funciona o teste rRT-PCR e por que ele é considerado o padrão-ouro na confirmação da covid-19? Não? Vem comigo que eu te explico direitinho! \nO termo rRT-PCR vem do Inglês e descomprimindo temos \"real time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction\", que significa \"reação em cadeia da transcriptase reversa e polimerase em tempo real\" - mas o que é isso? Basicamente a técnica de PCR se baseia na extração de DNA de uma amostra de saliva, tecidos e\/ou secreções que é analisada em laboratório. Como pode acontecer de uma amostra ter muito pouco DNA, nós aumentamos essa concentração por meio de reações químicas -  por isso que mesmo com apenas um simples bulbo de cabelo podemos identificar em laboratório quem é a pessoa cujo DNA está presente naquele bulbo! \nSuper elegante essa técnica de PCR, né!\nO novo coronavírus é um vírus a base de RNA, então o laboratório o RNA viral é convertido em DNA, que chamamos de DNA complementar. Em seguida, o DNA complementar obtido é passado em um equipamento: se o DNA complementar estiver ali, então o equipamento acusa que a amostra é positiva para o novo coronavírus.\nQuer saber mais? Se joga no meu vídeo, meu amor! \nE se você ainda tiver alguma dúvida, é só perguntar aqui nos comentários que eu te respondo! \nE vale lembrar: se puder, fique em casa, lave frequentemente as mãos com água e sabão. Não tem saneamento básico na sua região ou no momento não tem pia por perto? Use álcool em gel! Se for muito essencial sair, use máscaras e mantenha o distanciamento social! \nLembre-se que não é só sobre você: saúde em tempos de pandemia é sempre um problema de todos! Pense nisso!\nSe cuidem!

Con este préstamo, Kodak creará la capacidad necesaria para producir medicamentos esenciales.\n\nEl país todavía se enfrenta a una escasez de antibióticos básicos como la doxiciclina y la amoxicilina, que son cruciales para los pacientes de coronavirus y China controla el 90 por ciento de las sustancias químicas básicas para fabricarlos.\n\nDurante la pandemia, los países donde se encuentran las instalaciones de producción impusieron restricciones a la exportación de artículos de necesidad crítica. Esto interrumpió la cadena de suministro global de la industria farmacéutica estadounidense y alarmó al Congreso y a la Casa Blanca.\n\nEl presidente Donald Trump llamó al acuerdo \u201Cun paso trascendental para lograr la independencia farmacéutica estadounidense\u201D.

I ask them questions about how they feel about everything going on right now, like the COVID-19 Pandemic, the Black Lives Matter movement, and online learning. The goal of this project is to communicate how students are feeling about the state of our world right now while still maintaining quarantine.\n\n\u201CPeople just aren\u2019t taking [the pandemic] seriously. I think a lot of people are learning to spend time with themselves, which sounds so weird, but I feel like our generation is really social - we hang out with people a lot and we really depend on other people a lot, especially because of social media and everything.

All my life I'm tuned to celebrating occasions and a must for that is wearing new clothes. So, for every purchase, I mentally tag to an occasion or the other during the year and then the piece of clothing stays nicely tucked in my cupboard, till the occasion comes. If one is missed, then it goes to the next occasion and so on.\nBut life sometimes spans out a twist to show that things can't always go linear, or as planned; moreover, there's never any guarantee of life itself. The realisation has dawned more in this pandemic.. while we are grateful to be safe, healthy, with food and a comfortable life, with family and friends, the point to be noted is an entire year has gone away from our lives, wasted of the possibilities, the planned joyous moments, celebrations, vacations - even stripped of leading a normal life as we knew. It's debatable if we can ever \/ when  get back to our previous lifestyle, but till then, let's make the best of the situation.\n\nSo, from all the above thoughts, I inaugurated this Bishnupur katan silk saree with multicolored single ikkat designs all-over, without any occasion, after the saree was sitting in my cupboard for a year. The saree, woven in Bishnupur district of W Bengal, uses ikkat (tied n dyed yarns) from Sambalpur, dye the yarns again to bring desired hues and then weaving them with the warp of solid colored yarns. \nI loved this beautiful creation of 'design merger' with a contrast pallu. The designs are in matted hue, but sparkle brilliantly against light and during movement. You can see a close-up of the brilliant hues of the ikkat in the last collage.\nStay safe !

It literally feels like exploring the lives of traditional, religious, believing Hindus in exile who have contrary ideas. 'The Treatment Of Bibi Haldar' goes on to show how when there wasn't awarenes, Epilepsy was treated with the same regressive approach as most mental health issues are treated in India and 'The Third And Final Continent' again describes a longing for 'home' and echoes the creation of 'The Namesake'.\n.\n.\nRead it for #womenauthorsforthewin by @whosaysnotobooks Prompt: short stories by a woman author. #20thcenturyreadathon by @the_booksters_blog and @dancingbibliophile Prompt 1,2,6 & #diasporauthoreadathon by me, @preadsbooks and @justanotherbibliomaniac Prompt 7\n.\n#japreviews20","NumberOfLikes":423,"Hashtags":["#qotd-","#womenauthorsforthewin","#20thcenturyreadathon","#diasporauthoreadathon","#japreviews20"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by JAPNEET\u2022BOOKSTAGRAM\u2022IN 🇮🇳 in Delhi, India with @booknerdparadise, @jhumpalahiri, @booksparks, @4thestatebooks, @beautifulbookfeatures, @theb00kstagram, @bookstafeatures, @whosaysnotobooks, @ig.reads, @the_booksters_blog, @igreadsindia, @mybookfeatures, @dancingbibliophile, @bookishfeatures_, @perksofbookstagram, @shethepeoplebookclub, @bookreviewfeatures, and @exploreindianliterature.

Медики подозревают, что это может быть совершенно новый, не изученный ранее тип данного заболевания. Кроме того, они предупредили, что COVID-19 способен приводить к серьезным осложнениям только начинающегося диабета.» ⠀\n⠀\nПолученных данных о взаимоотношениях диабета и коронавируса пока не достаточно, чтобы говорить о точном влиянии этой инфекции на углеводный метаболизм. ⠀\nУчёны пока не знают, является ли это манифестацией диабета 1 и 2 типов или это диабет совершенно нового типа, пока не изученного. ⠀\n⠀\nГлавной причиной возникновения диабета при коронавирусной инфекции может быть то, что COVID-19 является системным заболеванием. ⠀\n⠀\nПо мнению ученых CoviDiab Registry, так происходит потому, что SARS-CoV-2 в организме действует на АПФ2 \u2014 рецептор, который находится в главнейших метаболических органах и тканях, включая клетки поджелудочной железы, жировую ткань, тонкую кишку и почки. Ученые предполагают, что после проникновения в них COVID провоцирует многочисленные дисфункции в механизме углеводного обмена.⠀\n⠀\nХотя, никакой связи данного рецептора с развитием СД нет. АПФ2 скорее можно связать с сердечно-сосудистыми патологиями, бронхиальной астмой, но нет никаких данных о его связи с диабетом различных типов. Опять же, любая бактериальная или вирусная инфекция может стать «пусковым фактором» диабета 1 типа, так как это аутоиммунное заболевание и для него характерен «запуск» именно за счёт внешних факторов. ⠀\n⠀\nЧто интересно, ученые предполагают, что к развитию сахарного диабета может приводить и терапия COVID-19. ⠀\n⠀\nПри заражении COVID-19 обезопасить себя от развития диабета можно, проводя регулярный контроль сахара в крови.⠀\n⠀\nБерегите себя и своих близких! 🙏🏻","NumberOfLikes":62,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Эндокринолог|Казань|Екб in Kazan, Tatarstan.

Communities across the province have mobilized new mask regulations in response, including compulsory requirements on Calgary transit and in Edmonton shopping centres. Even picturesque Banff, known for its popular ski resorts and majestic national park, is ramping up COVID-19 measures.\n\nWith travel-loving Western Canadians unable to travel far, Banff has become a magnet for local tourism. Safety ambassadors hired by the town have handed out 100,000 masks for tourists to voluntarily wear so far, but that's about to change. As of tomorrow, people in all indoor public spaces and on the town's main street will be required to wear masks or face shields. The town council has publicly emphasized the importance of social distancing and mask use amid strong tourist numbers, fearing the potential for a local outbreak. Banff recently gained national attention when several American tourists visited the alpine town using the \"Alaska loophole\" to circumvent the Canadian border lockdown.\n\nThis is the eleventh part of our series that features Canadian communities from coast-to-coast-to-coast, highlighting their unique pandemic experiences.\n\nPhoto: Banff, Alberta\nCredit: Henar Langa\n\n#covid19 #covid #coronavirus #virus #pandemic #quarantine #quarantinelife #canada #transcanada #pandemic2020 #2020 #alberta #banff #ski #nationalpark #park #snow #skiing #nature #naturephotography #naturelovers #thegreatoutdoors #mountains #mountain #mountainlife #trees #tram #alpine #wilderness #forest","NumberOfLikes":15,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#covid","#coronavirus","#virus","#pandemic","#quarantine","#quarantinelife","#canada","#transcanada","#pandemic2020","#2020","#alberta","#banff","#ski","#nationalpark","#park","#snow","#skiing","#nature","#naturephotography","#naturelovers","#thegreatoutdoors","#mountains","#mountain","#mountainlife","#trees","#tram","#alpine","#wilderness","#forest"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Respondkits on July 30, 2020.

How you view it is all a matter of perspective. \n.\n.\nMany of my clients have experienced big changes and shifts in their lives since March. And I am no different. \n\nToday I was Chatting with one of my regulars who is doing everything they can to relieve chronic pain. \n.\n.\nThey asked me, \u201Cwhat else can I do?\u201D And my response was this. \n.\n.\nWhat brings you joy?.... Do more of that. Sometimes it\u2019s not the problem that\u2019s the problem. Sometimes you need to have fun to relieve stress in the body.\n.\n.\n.\nThis pandemic has forced many people to stop, pause, reflect and move out of the grind of daily life. Paying bills, rushing here, rushing there, over committing to social activities....you name it. \n.\n.\nYes, there\u2019s been a lot of down sides to this pandemic but I\u2019ve seen a lot of good come out of it. In my own life too. \n.\n.\nPeople going out of their way to help others, true authentic connections, community, support, people slowing down to be more present in their lives. People rediscovering old hobbies they once enjoyed and finding their joy again. Trying new things and getting outside more. Leaving jobs, relationships and places that just don\u2019t work anymore. \n.\n.\nIt\u2019s been a blessing in disguise for many. \n.\n.\n.\nAnyone else trying to find the silver lining? What is some good that has come out of this for you? \n.\n.\nI know that the bond I have with my kids has gotten stronger, I have been taking more time for me to enjoy life, and laughing so hard I damn near pee my pants. \n.\n.\n.\n#momlife #prenatal #postpartum #winnipegmoms #winnipeg #manitoba #winnipegpregnancy #winnipegbusiness #mom #thisismotherhood #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":20,"Hashtags":["#momlife","#prenatal","#postpartum","#winnipegmoms","#winnipeg","#manitoba","#winnipegpregnancy","#winnipegbusiness","#mom","#thisismotherhood","#pandemic2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Lori Pohl, RMT Doula in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

At just a moment old, I gazed into her big brown eyes and she changed my whole world. I nursed her day and night, and I poured everything I had into her. I was her first word. I comforted her when she needed me, and I rocked her to sleep countless nights just so I could hold her for awhile longer. I cheered her on as she took her first steps, I kissed her boo-boo\u2019s, I fulfilled her every need, and I begged her to stop growing so quickly. She\u2019s been by my side from day one\u2014and now, she\u2019s going to kindergarten.\nIf we\u2019re being completely honest here, I\u2019m not handling it well. I didn\u2019t realize it until I felt the enormous butterflies in my stomach and the lump in my throat as I pulled into the school parking lot today and turned to her with tears in my eyes & asked if she was ready to meet her teacher.. and without hesitation she screamed YES! \n\n  In a few years I will probably be popping the champagne on the first day of school, but right now these emotions are strong. The simple thought of dropping her off on the first day brings an instant stream of tears. \n \n  The first day of kindergarten is coming, and that I can\u2019t stop it, but let me be sad for awhile. And to the mamas who have been there and done that, please be gentle on us. Let us feel these feels and work through them without feeling guilty. Give us a hug and say you remember those days.\nJust as our kids are entering a huge new world, so are we. So mama, if you\u2019re on the struggle bus with me, know you\u2019re not alone and that we will get through this.
