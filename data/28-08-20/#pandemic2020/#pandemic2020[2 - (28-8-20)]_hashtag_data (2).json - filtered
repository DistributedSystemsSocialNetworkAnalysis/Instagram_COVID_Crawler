That was the last trip I took the NYC before the virus had spread so much that New York State issued an emergency self-isolation protocol and everyone began working from home.\n\nThat's when I wondered, as an architect with product design capabilities, how can I help? A handful of my friends expressed the same question and I remember talking to @archivalley about this question.\n\nThe day after we discussed different ways I could help, I discovered a forum for makers to connect and fabricate products to help protect our medical professionals from the virus. I met a gentleman named Jacob B. who generously donated his time and 3D printer to make the visor portions of face shields. He was looking for someone with a laser cutter to make the face shield parts so he can assemble and deliver the final face shields to hospitals. The rest was history.\n\nOne day later, I shipped the laser cut PETG face shields to Jacob. Jacob assembled them and delivered them to hospitals.\n\nAll of this started from a simple question, how can I help? \n\nSo, how can I help? What are you helping with? Let me know in the comments section.\n\n#glowforge #glowforgemade #glowforgecreations #lasercutter #lasercutting #lasercut #lasercutacrylic #faceshield #faceshields #faceshieldcovid19 #essentialmedicalsupplies #designingforhumanity #designforhumanity #covid19 #covid #covid_19 #pandemic #pandemic2020 #essentialworker #helpothers #helpessentialworkers #protectmedicalprofessionals #designforgood #ungstudio #makersgonnamake #makersmovement #makerscovidresponse #makerscovid19","NumberOfLikes":30,"Hashtags":["#glowforge","#glowforgemade","#glowforgecreations","#lasercutter","#lasercutting","#lasercut","#lasercutacrylic","#faceshield","#faceshields","#faceshieldcovid19","#essentialmedicalsupplies","#designingforhumanity","#designforhumanity","#covid19","#covid","#covid_19","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#essentialworker","#helpothers","#helpessentialworkers","#protectmedicalprofessionals","#designforgood","#ungstudio","#makersgonnamake","#makersmovement","#makerscovidresponse","#makerscovid19"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":7,"Timestamp":1598392807,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 26 00:00:07 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"fordboyutah","CaptionText":"Rocco.

The success of films featuring diversity in recent years only amplifies a fact we\u2019ve all known our whole lives but Hollywood has only just been catching on to: Representation Matters. Audiences not only want, but they need to see diversity in films, and the success of films like Tangerine, A Fantastic Woman, Always Be My Maybe, Crazy Rich Asians and many more prove that. SEE YOU THEN is right along side those films representing the stories of Asian American and LGBTQIA+ communities.\n\nWhat we never could have predicted was this pandemic and the alarming relevant need for new content. Film production in America has pretty much come to a complete stop, meaning almost no new content is being created right now. At the same time, audiences staying home to social distance themselves are consuming films and TV faster than ever before. SEE YOU THEN finished filming in February 2020, right before America was really affected by Covid-19. We have been completing post-production over the past several months remotely and will soon be ready to meet audiences demand for new content. We will be discussing how editing during the pandemic has been, and what our plans for the future are in a Live Chat discussion today at 2 pm PT on the Vanishing Angle Facebook page with producers Mari Walker, Kristen Uno, Mia Schulman, and Matt Miller.\n\nOnly 2 days left to invest!

Testing us every damn day with new WTF surprises and never seen before challenges. But, you\u2019d never know it with these smiles. \n.\nAn amazing woman and friend I met through @infertilityunfiltered reached out and asked if she could take our photos as a gift. If you know me, there is no greater gift than photos. Every picture tells its own story, and has the magical ability to hold life still just for an instant. Photos are my most prized possessions because when I look at them I FEEL them more than I see them. \n.\nJonathan, on the other hand, needed convincing. His reaction was \u201Cwhy pictures? For what? I don\u2019t get it?\u201D. But ya see, that\u2019s what makes these photos so magical. No ivf transfer, no pregnancy announcement, no newborn photos, no holiday card posing. No agenda. \n.\nJust us, in the middle of a pandemic shit storm finding joy just being with each other, in our home. I think Jonathan\u2019s face says it all. What are these photos for, you ask?? How about THIS cheesy smile right here 👨🏽👆🏼or those cute little piggies and long tan legs👧🏽. I know I definitely want to always remember how her little lips feel pressed on mine 💋. These photos give me all this and more. \n.\nThank you @altheagarden_photography from the bottom of my heart, Jonathan and I will forever cherish these simple moments. I\u2019m pretty sure he gets it now 😉.\n.\nAlthea, seeing you find true happiness and finally becoming a mother was already your gift to me. You are the gift my friend!

For me it is having the time to enjoy the simple things in life, from watching nature change into its finest clothing has been a real joy, it has allowed a sense of connection with nature and wildlife on a deeper level. The time to share a chat with neighbours that we hardly ever spoke to before and the real camaraderie of sharing and helping one another is one that I hope will last into the future, it has been so comforting to know that others too have the time to converse and are willing to do so, rather than racing off to face another working day. These are all pretty simple things but have made a huge difference in peoples lives, especially those that live alone and long may it continue. I have added some of my drawings that I have been working on during this time, which is my way of using all the extra time to be creative which in turn helps to diffuse the impact of the pandemic. #contemporaryart #oilpastel #oilpastels #oilpastelonpaper #landscapedrawing #drawing #drawings #covid19 #covid_19 #covid  #lockdown #lockdown2020 #lockdownlife #lockdowndiaries #pandemic #pandemic2020 #wellbeing #wellbeingjourney #mindfulness #mindful","NumberOfLikes":86,"Hashtags":["#contemporaryart","#oilpastel","#oilpastels","#oilpastelonpaper","#landscapedrawing","#drawing","#drawings","#covid19","#covid_19","#covid","#lockdown","#lockdown2020","#lockdownlife","#lockdowndiaries","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#wellbeing","#wellbeingjourney","#mindfulness","#mindful"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Elaine Fox on August 25, 2020.

They assumed, like many others, that writing is easy for me, as I used to work for many years as a journalist. It's not at all true. I always thought that you need a good story in order to be able to write something that would be of real interest to anyone. My text is a plain diary of the weeks I've spent in lockdown. My partner found the idea challenging and he wrote a nice short story that is inserted in and adds value to my text ;). He is next to me as I write this introduction and says \"I hope our story is one of the best, there is some romance involved, we should call it Romance in Times of Crises\" - our romance was in crisis indeed, but all's well that ends well. I take pride in saying that our story, by being one of the first, encouraged the others to write; they very likely thought \"I can definitely do better\" and most of them did great! What I like best about these stories is their authenticity, the authors are all genuine and so real, I am honoured to be in such a good company.. \nThe book is about to be published, I am very proud of my friends who made it happen.\"\n#worldspandemicchronicles\n#2020vision\n#lockdown2020\n#uk\n#lockdownlife\n#lockdonuk\n#quarantinelife\n#pandemic2020 #covid_19  #covid19 #scarborough #uk","NumberOfLikes":11,"Hashtags":["#worldspandemicchronicles","#2020vision","#lockdown2020","#uk","#lockdownlife","#lockdonuk","#quarantinelife","#pandemic2020","#covid_19","#covid19","#scarborough","#uk"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @worldspandemicchronicles on August 25, 2020.

If anything, they're more difficult than they used to be. \nYes the examination period is longer, but again that does not hint to easier examinations.\nLecturers are understanding to a point but assignments\/examinations still occur 1 per week per course and they even require much more time than they previously did. (Well for Math)\n\nSo, no! Online schooling is not 100% better or \"easier\".\n\nHow I got through my last semester:\n\nI prayed every single day, many many many times a day for the strength and will to get through it. There were days where staying in bed felt like all I wanted but those are the days I got up. Motivated myself daily and stayed motivated regardless of how stressful the day was. Then there were days at a time where I was awake for the full 24hrs per day, sometimes only getting in a couple hours of sleep for the week. I even ended up with Insomnia way after the Semester was over. But, like all things, hard work was required.\n\nThe main point of this message being:\nMotivate yourself daily. Stay motivated by setting daily\/weekly\/monthly goals in every aspect of your life. Every morning tell yourself that you are blessed,  beautiful, worthy, loved and capable.\n\n#motivational_quotes #motivationmonday #blogger #trinidadandtobago #trinicontentcreator #influencer #blazin_beauties #brownskingirlwhoblog #motivated #studies📚 #onlineschooling #pandemic2020 #staymotivated💪 #challenges #refined_and_refined","NumberOfLikes":83,"Hashtags":["#motivational_quotes","#motivationmonday","#blogger","#trinidadandtobago","#trinicontentcreator","#influencer","#blazin_beauties","#brownskingirlwhoblog","#motivated","#studies📚","#onlineschooling","#pandemic2020","#staymotivated💪","#challenges","#refined_and_refined"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by 🗂 Content Creator in Trinidad and Tobago.

When it comes to a virus that has killed over 90 children in America in just six months, and left many more with lasting consequences, being so dedicated to their sports can be dangerous. See, the thing is, no one is asking anyone to give up sports permanently. We know that not having physical contact with others has helped slow #covid19 The longer we keep trying to keep things as normal as possible, the longer we'll need to be restricted. If everyone would just accept that and REALLY stay home for awhile, we could mostly have it controlled by the time flu season hits hard. Keeping up how we are is likely to lead to two pandemics at once happening, according to several experts. That's why there are commercials all over tv begging people to wear masks and stay distanced, not just when it's convenient to, but at any time it is POSSIBLE. In other words, if your child doesn't have a serious need to have in-person instruction, do virtual learning. If you don't NEED to do something, stay home. You should still be limiting who is going out to stores and such, just like in the beginning. I've seen people letting their kids run wild all over the store in no masks. If you MUST take everyone with you, you need a system to keep them close to you, and safe. You're not hurting them by restricting their movements during this time- you are doing your job as a parent and protecting them. Please stop listening to ANYONE but the medical professionals who are experts dealing with this virus first hand. They are very clearly telling you the same things I am. It's just constantly being twisted by political blindness and conspiracy theories. See through those things and protect your children. I don't want to see a news article stating a child has died because we opened schools back up for in-person instruction when WE HAVE THE DATA & evidence to show that it is 100% a possibility.

Many religious ceremonies involve singing, such as Sunday Mass at Church. A study found that singing caused 53 of the 61 choir members testing positive and 102 of 130 members of an Amsterdam choir developed COVID-19 after a performance, and four people associated with the choir died. In Austria, 43 of 44 participants in a choir seminar tested positive. \n\nRegardless of the distance between the musicians, harmony comes with dedicated, supervised practice. In an uncontrolled setting with distractions, dedicated practice is impossible. However, musicians also gain something by practicing at home. In a comfortable, relaxed environment they may be able to play better. Whether good or bad, stay-at-home musicians will give their audience a unique performance as they perform in the comfort, or discomfort, of their own home. \n\nhttps:\/\/thelcr.com\/can-music-programs-survive-covid-19\/ (article in bio) \n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n#thelcr #musicclass #virtuallearning #educationmatters #musiceducation #socialjustice #harmony #votingmatters #choirlife #choirs #choirmusic #justiceforbreonnataylor #musicals #musicianslife #education #musiciansdaily #singing🎤 #wesing #highschool #highschoolmusical #discrimination #choirdirector #beautifulvoice #beautifulvoices #pandemic2020 #teachersrock #musicteacher #musicmatters #jazzmusician #classicalmusician","NumberOfLikes":12,"Hashtags":["#thelcr","#musicclass","#virtuallearning","#educationmatters","#musiceducation","#socialjustice","#harmony","#votingmatters","#choirlife","#choirs","#choirmusic","#justiceforbreonnataylor","#musicals","#musicianslife","#education","#musiciansdaily","#singing🎤","#wesing","#highschool","#highschoolmusical","#discrimination","#choirdirector","#beautifulvoice","#beautifulvoices","#pandemic2020","#teachersrock","#musicteacher","#musicmatters","#jazzmusician","#classicalmusician"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The LCR in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

With him more than anyone else. \"Let's go\", he said to me the other night. \"Where\", I said excitement making it's rare appearance in my mind. \"Somewhere. Anywhere.\" His longing was evident. As was his despair. His wanderlust was thwarted. Brutally. And all he had to cling to, like the rest of us, was hope. \"Let's\", I said, already looking forward to something for the first time in months.\nAnd so we left. At the crack of dawn. On a beautiful Sunday morning. With no destination in mind. Only the intention of absorbing the surroundings and drinking in the weather. This is where we landed. Amid nature in all its resplendent glory, without another human, or human-made aberration in sight.

This is forever my favorite picture of him. He\u2019s going back to school tomorrow. We loved our beautiful Montessori school. Well, we still do in theory. It\u2019s not the school we don\u2019t love. He\u2019s having shorter days, and is only going for half the week for a fall and spring semester. Probably an estimated 40 days total. My heart feels so heavy about it all. A third of those days are about 3 hours long. \n\nHe used to love it so much. Never, not once, did he get upset during drop off. He occasionally said bye and waved me off, but normally he couldn\u2019t even be bothered to, he was to busy loving playing with his friends.\n\nHe said he felt different trying to go to bed tonight knowing he has school in the morning. We talked about how it would be all outside, and his best friend would be there. That cheered him up a little bit, enough to finally fall asleep. He seemed distressed. My little social butterfly, doesn\u2019t want to leave home. I know in my mama heart it\u2019s because of how the world is shifting. While I know there so much delicious potential to sneak a lot of goodness in with this shift, moments like these remind me of how hard it still can be. Remember to talk to your kids about what their next step is and check in with them regularly on it. This world is scary enough for them. It\u2019s scary enough for adults.

Amidst the current pandemic, this series is relevant as we try to understand what\u2019s happening and look for ways to engage the future. This portrait of Flannery O'Connor, a collector of oddities and visionary, includes symbols of violence she used as a the catalyst for grace, and agents of change -- the bull that gorges and kills, and the fire that both destroys the wood and references the divine. The tattoo man both destructively seeks human connection with the lure of apples, then rejects it.

For me, it was church. I wasn\u2019t able to attend church services frequently during my pregnancy due to severe morning sickness. After that, I was recovering from my C-section during a pandemic that caused churches to close their doors. When our church was able to open again I was still unable to attend due to my most recent health issues (gallbladder surgery, pancreatitis, pseudocysts, hospital stays, etc.). This morning it felt like everything fell into place to allow us to finally go back to church (my pain was tolerable and I actually had enough energy to get out of bed). All I can say is I didn\u2019t know how much I missed the fellowship, the singing, and the people until I was there again.
