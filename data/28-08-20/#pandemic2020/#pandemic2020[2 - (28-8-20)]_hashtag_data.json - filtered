It would be lovely if you could subscribe, please ü•∞. Link in bio.\nEveryone has had a different experience throughout this pandemic. Some experiences will be relatable to others. Of course, I am aware that people have lost there loved ones because of this virus and that is so painful. We all FEEL different emotions because we all have different experiences throughout life and that is ok. Yes, we can put things in perspective, but we should never feel guilty for how we FEEL. For example, My Grandad passed away in January then 2 months later my Granny had to isolate for so many weeks on her own. I can\u2019t relate to that, but I\u2019m able to understand that would have been very difficult for her. I can\u2019t relate to all the long hours the NHS staff would have had to work to help the patients, but I\u2019m able to appreciate and acknowledge them for all their hard work ‚ú®.\nI, however, have had so many changes throughout this lockdown. My relationship ended, I lost my job because I had to move from London to Newcastle in the height of the pandemic in April. Bearing in mind I had just made all these new changes in December to leave a job in the NHS up north so I could move to London and commit to my relationship. Anyways that was my story I kept on telling myself, but it\u2019s not anymore as I have had to change my mindset instead of being my own self-pity party. It takes me a while to get used to change and settle into things, therefore I have struggled with all these changes again. Although I\u2019m not the type of person to adapt to change quickly I don\u2019t ever want this to put me off from making other big changes in my life again.

Today\u2019s stop on my pandemic Hollywood tour is the house that the Lopez family supposedly lived in on the show!\n\n\u201CThe George Lopez Show\u201D house was originally built in 1885, making it the second-oldest home in San Fernando. The idyllic, Victorian, 4-bedroom, single family residence was commissioned by Senator Charles Maclay, a founder of San Fernando, and his wife, Catherine Paxton Maclay.\n\nThe Lopez family home from show is located at \u202A671 Fourth Street in San Fernando\u202C. Thankfully, the property looks much the same in person as it did onscreen, though it has since been painted green. Please note that this is a private residence so if you visit please do not trespass or disturb the people that live there.\n\n\u201CThe George Lopez Show\u201D originally aired for six seasons on ABC from 2002 to 2007. It is currently in syndication on Nick at Nite, and stars the titular comedian George Lopez, who plays a fictionalized version of himself and revolves around his life at work and raising his family at home.\n\nLopez drew much of the material for the show from his own life experiences, especially his upbringing in the San Fernando Valley. Lopez was one of the few Latinos to star in a television comedy series, following in the footsteps of Desi Arnaz, Freddie Prinze, and John Leguizamo.\n\nFun facts - The sitcom would have never existed without Oscar winning actress Sandra Bullock. In 2000, Bullock saw Lopez perform live at the Brea Improv Comedy Club. Bullock had been interested in developing a TV show with a Latino storyline, being concerned about the lack of visibility for Latinos on American television. Bullock approached Lopez backstage after the show and made her pitch to produce and star in a situational comedy centered around the comedian. \n\nFor the first five seasons, the show had an all-Latino cast with the exception of Albanian American actress Masiela Lusha, who played George\u2019s daughter Carmen.\n\nThe character \u201CGeorge Lopez\" was ranked #18 in \"TV Guide\"'s list of the \"50 Greatest TV Dads of All Time\"#filminglocation #thegeorgelopezshow #sanfernando #hollywoodtour #pandemic2020 #socialdistancing #wearamask #tonymiros","NumberOfLikes":32,"Hashtags":["#18","#filminglocation","#thegeorgelopezshow","#sanfernando","#hollywoodtour","#pandemic2020","#socialdistancing","#wearamask","#tonymiros"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1598374016,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 18:46:56 CEST 2020","Location":"San Fernando Valley"},{"CaptionText":"Narrow streets has ways of bringing you closer to beautiful realities üá≤üá¶ \n\u2060\nCool #solotravel üì∏ by @boifromvenus\n\u2060\nFollow & Tag @travsolo on your awesome travel pics for a chance to be featured! ‚úàÔ∏è\u2060\n.\u2060\n.\u2060\n.\u2060\n.\u2060\n.\u2060\n.\u2060\n.\u2060\n#solofemaletraveller #socialdistancingworks #extrovertedintrovert\u2063 #solotraveler #solotravelingisfun #solotraveling #girlstravel #globaltravel #covidtravel #pandemic2020 #pandemictravel #covidtravel2020 #morrocco","NumberOfLikes":37,"Hashtags":["#solotravel","#solofemaletraveller","#socialdistancingworks","#extrovertedintrovert\u2063","#solotraveler","#solotravelingisfun","#solotraveling","#girlstravel","#globaltravel","#covidtravel","#pandemic2020","#pandemictravel","#covidtravel2020","#morrocco"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Solo Travel Easier on August 25, 2020.

If anything, they're more difficult than they used to be. \nYes the examination period is longer, but again that does not hint to easier examinations.\nLecturers are understanding to a point but assignments\/examinations still occur 1 per week per course and they even require much more time than they previously did. (Well for Math)\n\nSo, no! Online schooling is not 100% better or \"easier\".\n\nHow I got through my last semester:\n\nI prayed every single day, many many many times a day for the strength and will to get through it. There were days where staying in bed felt like all I wanted but those are the days I got up. Motivated myself daily and stayed motivated regardless of how stressful the day was. Then there were days at a time where I was awake for the full 24hrs per day, sometimes only getting in a couple hours of sleep for the week. I even ended up with Insomnia way after the Semester was over. But, like all things, hard work was required.\n\nThe main point of this message being:\nMotivate yourself daily. Stay motivated by setting daily\/weekly\/monthly goals in every aspect of your life. Every morning tell yourself that you are blessed,  beautiful, worthy, loved and capable.\n\n#motivational_quotes #motivationmonday #blogger #trinidadandtobago #trinicontentcreator #influencer #blazin_beauties #brownskingirlwhoblog #motivated #studiesüìö #onlineschooling #pandemic2020 #staymotivatedüí™ #challenges #refined_and_refined","NumberOfLikes":83,"Hashtags":["#motivational_quotes","#motivationmonday","#blogger","#trinidadandtobago","#trinicontentcreator","#influencer","#blazin_beauties","#brownskingirlwhoblog","#motivated","#studiesüìö","#onlineschooling","#pandemic2020","#staymotivatedüí™","#challenges","#refined_and_refined"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by üóÇ Content Creator in Trinidad and Tobago.

When it comes to a virus that has killed over 90 children in America in just six months, and left many more with lasting consequences, being so dedicated to their sports can be dangerous. See, the thing is, no one is asking anyone to give up sports permanently. We know that not having physical contact with others has helped slow #covid19 The longer we keep trying to keep things as normal as possible, the longer we'll need to be restricted. If everyone would just accept that and REALLY stay home for awhile, we could mostly have it controlled by the time flu season hits hard. Keeping up how we are is likely to lead to two pandemics at once happening, according to several experts. That's why there are commercials all over tv begging people to wear masks and stay distanced, not just when it's convenient to, but at any time it is POSSIBLE. In other words, if your child doesn't have a serious need to have in-person instruction, do virtual learning. If you don't NEED to do something, stay home. You should still be limiting who is going out to stores and such, just like in the beginning. I've seen people letting their kids run wild all over the store in no masks. If you MUST take everyone with you, you need a system to keep them close to you, and safe. You're not hurting them by restricting their movements during this time- you are doing your job as a parent and protecting them. Please stop listening to ANYONE but the medical professionals who are experts dealing with this virus first hand. They are very clearly telling you the same things I am. It's just constantly being twisted by political blindness and conspiracy theories. See through those things and protect your children. I don't want to see a news article stating a child has died because we opened schools back up for in-person instruction when WE HAVE THE DATA & evidence to show that it is 100% a possibility.

After going nearly 35 years without using perfume, some days I rub a bit on my wrists. Surrounding myself with color has been a priority.

Some took it as a curse and some took it as a challenge. But at the end it is our decision how we want to look it at as.\n\nHere are my 3 major learnings from this lockdown:\n\n1. ADAPT TO THE CHANGES IF YOU WANT TO SUCCEED\nSometimes, things are not in our hands and don't go in the way we want it to but complaining about it makes it even worse. Just sitting there and waiting for the right time will lead you nowhere. Get up, Dress up and Show up ! By motivating yourself, you can motivate and inspire 100 other people. \n\n2. RESPECT EACH OTHERS WORK \nNo work is small or big ! The thing which is small or big is your mindset. Don't compare. Everyone is unique. Celebrate every small accomplishment of your dear ones. Always remember a single word of appreciation can actually make their day. Be kind.\n\n3. A LITTLE QUALITY TIME WITH FAMILY IS ALL WE NEED\nFamily is build up only on two things: Love and Time. Just sit at home, watch a movie, remember old times, make fun of each other but do it together. Family is the strength you need for all your bad days. No amount of money or success can make you as happy as the time spent with your family. It is worth every second.\n\nWHAT ARE YOUR LEARNINGS?\n.\nDrop a comment below and let me know !‚ù§Ô∏è\n.\n\nPC: @bhanukashyap ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\n#pandemic2020 #positivevibes #challengeyourself #bekind #respectothers #familymatters #beyourself","NumberOfLikes":298,"Hashtags":["#pandemic2020","#positivevibes","#challengeyourself","#bekind","#respectothers","#familymatters","#beyourself"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Kriti Adhikari in Pandemic 2020 with @zjaanch, @swati_pathania, @ibhavnaa, @nanditamanna, @i.am.jags, @manisha_nowlakha, @divwassup, @guptapankhuri, @kanika3009, @edwinphilip3, @fit.prateek, @diosa_sassa, @pushpendra_n21, @dipikamathur, @savita.pokhriyal, @abbhishek_, @deeptidixit_09, @physicaleducationworld, @apka_vegan_dost, and @getfitwithrupal.

Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. James 4:7\n\nAnd those he predestined, he also called;¬†those he called, he also justified;¬†those he justified, he also glorified. Romans 8:30\n\nAnd we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who ¬†have been called according to his purpose. Romans 8:28\n\nbut those who hope in the¬†Lord\nwill renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles;¬†they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.Isaiah 40:31\n\nBut he said to me, \u201CMy grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.\u201D Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 2 Corinthians 12:9\n\nAnd my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
