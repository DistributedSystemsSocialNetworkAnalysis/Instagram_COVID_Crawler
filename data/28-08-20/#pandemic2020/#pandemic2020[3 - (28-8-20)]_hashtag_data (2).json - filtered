Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. James 4:7\n\nAnd those he predestined, he also called;¬†those he called, he also justified;¬†those he justified, he also glorified. Romans 8:30\n\nAnd we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who ¬†have been called according to his purpose. Romans 8:28\n\nbut those who hope in the¬†Lord\nwill renew their strength.

I hope it's the same with people in other countries as well,  we cannot fear the virus anymore and stay locked up in our houses , as this is not ending any day soon. \n\nSo it's important that we take care of ourselves as much as we can , beginning from wearing masks to sanitizing our hands. Also it's important to eat healthy food , vegetables and food rich in vitamin C to boost our immunity . Stay away from unhealthy food and try to cook as much as you can at home and carry it to work. \n\nStaying away from parties or crowded places should be kept in mind always. \n\nAs I don't work in a hospital or not looking after Covid patients , so I am using reusable cloth masks , you can make them at home or buy them based on your need. They are much more sustainable and economical. \n\nSo if you guys are interested in mask reviews ,comment down below and I will show some of the cloth masks that I am using during this pandemic and share my experience . \n\n#wearyourmask #pandemic2020 #stayhome #staysafe #eatvitaminceveryday #boostyourimmunity #wearclothmasks #savetheoceans #sustainableliving","NumberOfLikes":28,"Hashtags":["#wearyourmask","#pandemic2020","#stayhome","#staysafe","#eatvitaminceveryday","#boostyourimmunity","#wearclothmasks","#savetheoceans","#sustainableliving"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Tripti Mukherjee on August 22, 2020 tagging @vastramay.

Man...what a city and people #cuscoper√∫ is. I flew into Cusco on March 9th for what was supposed  to be a simple 9 day exploration through Lima, Cusco and Machu Picchu with the lady. The pandemic hit Peru March 17.  That 9 day trek has now turned into 164 days and counting. Quarantined in Cusco for 3.5 months of it under martial law. What a freakin  experience and wild ride this has been. Nothing could have prepared me for it! But...it hasn't come without its sacrifices, however. To get where you want to go and preserve your personal integrity and accountability along the way sometimes sacrifices need to be made. Chances need to be taken, and sometimes decisions might not be in your own best interest and that's okay, because that's part of adulting. Putting people ahead of yourself feels good. It's not always about you. Because sometimes being able to sleep at night and being happy when you wake up knowing you made the right decision outweighs everything anyone could ever want when it comes to finding internal peace and happiness.

It can severely affect the heart, vessels, nerves, kidney, skin and brain. Studies have shown that SAR-CoV-2 can cause severe damage, even in patients with mild symptoms or those in recovery. Often this damage is detected very late or not at all. People recovering from symptoms noted trouble with concentration, confused thoughts, memory loss, loss of consciousness, seizures, loss of smell and taste, psychosis, anxiety, delirium, trouble focusing, etc. Researchers found that one-way COVID attacks the body is by causing inflammation and swelling of the brain. \n\nBecause of significant involvement of lungs (prolonged ventilators, tracheostomy and dyspnea), nerve damage, and nervous system dysfunction (encephalopathy, stroke, seizure, psychiatric changes, etc.) Cognitive, Speech, Language and Swallowing difficulties are observed in individuals positive with COVID-19. A Speech-Language Pathologist (SLP) can help with the mentioned problems.\n\n‚≠êCOMMUNICATION: When on ventilator\/tracheostomy and individual is unble to voice,SLP can provide with alternative methods of communication. Some individuals post stroke\/encephalopathy have slurred speech (Dysarthria) or language difficulty (Aphasia) which requires help with communication and expression.\n\n‚≠êSWALLOWING: Breathing tube, vocal cord damage, fluids in lungs, in-coordination or weakness of throat and oral muscles can cause significant swallowing difficulties and requires prompt intervention by an SLP.\n\n‚≠êCOGNITION: With cognitive functions (memory, problem solving, reasoning, attention etc) affected, an SLP can step in with strategies and early intervention.\n.\n.\n.\n#covid19 #covid19india #covid #coronavirus #pandemic #pandemic2020 #speechlanguagetherapy #speechtherapy #languagetherapy #swallowtherapy #dysphagiatherapy #slp #slpsofinstagram #speech #language #cognition #swallowing #aphasia #dysarthria #dysphagia #cognitiveimpairment #tracheostomy #ventilator #encephalopathy #memoryloss #lossoftasteandsmell #nervedamage #seizures #mumbai #fixmyspeech","NumberOfLikes":21,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#covid19india","#covid","#coronavirus","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#speechlanguagetherapy","#speechtherapy","#languagetherapy","#swallowtherapy","#dysphagiatherapy","#slp","#slpsofinstagram","#speech","#language","#cognition","#swallowing","#aphasia","#dysarthria","#dysphagia","#cognitiveimpairment","#tracheostomy","#ventilator","#encephalopathy","#memoryloss","#lossoftasteandsmell","#nervedamage","#seizures","#mumbai","#fixmyspeech"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by All About Speech Therapy in Mumbai, Maharashtra.

The masks? Children home from everything? Not enough time in the day? ü§ö Too much time? The politics? The fear? Maybe the lack of TP! \n\nLast night I fed my kids Mr Noodles for dinner so I could work out. \nThat was my coping. I haven\u2019t been consistent because somebody or some animal is usually in need of ALL OF my time. \nI had to make a sacrifice somewhere because I crave working out. It gives me that wonderful release of endorphins. It makes me feel accomplished. It makes me feel strong and healthy and happy. I\u2019ve been ignoring my body\u2019s unhappiness in order to give to others. \n\nMy back has been sore from being unprotected from my weak core muscles, working nights and lifting patients. There is more to me that touches uncomfortably and gets in the way of other things. My body wants to run, wants to move. Wants to feel exerted. \nFarm work and riding and a leisurely bike ride aren\u2019t enough for me, I need that strenuous physical activity. \n\nSo last night instead of cooking a meal from scratch, I let the kids have Mr Noodles. And it\u2019s totally ok. ONCE IN AWHILE. \nEven with that, I didn\u2019t have time to change into workout clothes, put a bra on, warm up or cool down. (Well I kind of cooled down as I showered for my third night shift.) \nBut I spent 20 minutes working a sweat, and I was so glad I did! \n\nWhat have you been doing to cope with the new pandemic challenges? \n\n#copingstrategies #sparetime #momof4kids #pandemicparenting #covidworkout #mentalhealthmatters #healthyliving #changeyourmindsetchangeyourlife #pandemic2020 #countyourblessings #justdoit‚úî #noexcusesmom","NumberOfLikes":17,"Hashtags":["#copingstrategies","#sparetime","#momof4kids","#pandemicparenting","#covidworkout","#mentalhealthmatters","#healthyliving","#changeyourmindsetchangeyourlife","#pandemic2020","#countyourblessings","#justdoit‚úî","#noexcusesmom"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Sherri M Latimer on August 21, 2020.

The bench, headed by Justice Sanjay K Kaul, took a grim view of such unsubstantiated claims and the very filing of such a PIL in the apex court.\n\nIt was of the view that the direction sought in Gyantara's PIL were completely misconceived and that it was time to send a message that people should not approach a court with such contentions.\n\nThe bench, which also had Justices Ajay Rastogi and Aniruddha Bose, further noted that the primary consideration of the petitioner in filing such a petition seemed to be getting some attention and publicity.\n\n\"We are of the view that such kind of petitions must be stopped as anybody and everybody thinks they have some cure for the situation,\" it maintained.\n\nThe court, in its order on Thursday, added that such petitioners seek to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution, possibly only to gain some publicity.\n\n\"Such wastage of judicial time is completely inappropriate,\" held the bench.

The dream, moreso a nightmare, paralyses you with fear but is actually a missive for change. The shadows in our lives remind us of the things we must leave behind and the things we must pursue.\n\nSometimes even in the face of immense calamity, there is hardly any change.

This painting is one of the greatest masterpieces in Western art and caps an entire tradition of Medieval depictions of suffering, just before the Reformation would kick in. It was made for a hospital where plague sufferers and those with skin disease were treated, which is why Christ is covered in sores. This would allow the patients a feeling that they were not alone in heading towards their painful and unhygenic ending. Gr√ºnewald's painting feels very out of place and out of time, even for the time it was made in. That is its strength, because it allows an atheist like myself to get inspiration from it five centuries later. \n\nOne artist who was much inspired by Gr√ºnewald was the amazing composer Paul Hindemith. In the 1930s, as Germany was spiralling out of control, he composed an opera based on Gr√ºnewald and the Peasants Rebellion of 1525. Matis der Maler is rarely performed, but includes actors posing as the painting and lots of soul-searching arias about the position of the artist in a war-torn Germany. It was evidently banned, and Hindemith left for America. The image above is a still from a 1950s performance of the opera, which was printed on a postcard.\n\nI have made my computer calculate what the picture would look like without heads. This leaves just bodies, dramatic shadows and empty hand gestures on a stage. But then again history repeats itself, first as a tragedy, then as a farce. Only greatness like that of Gr√ºnewald is a constant, as are the ever-fainter echoes of our complicated cultural histories. And of course headless chickens, they are constants too. \n\nOh! Guess who else is from Colmar? Bartholdi, who built the Statue of Liberty. The psychogeography is off the scale.\n\n#matisdermaler #paulhindemith #matthiasgr√ºnewald #gr√ºnewald #grunewald #2020 #2020art #pandemic2020 #pandemicart #isenheimeraltar #colmarfrance #opera #sybrenrenema #hindemith #artandmusic #musicandart #classicalmusic #renaissanceart #cuiusregioeiusreligio #headlesschicken #secondwave","NumberOfLikes":12,"Hashtags":["#matisdermaler","#paulhindemith","#matthiasgr√ºnewald","#gr√ºnewald","#grunewald","#2020","#2020art","#pandemic2020","#pandemicart","#isenheimeraltar","#colmarfrance","#opera","#sybrenrenema","#hindemith","#artandmusic","#musicandart","#classicalmusic","#renaissanceart","#cuiusregioeiusreligio","#headlesschicken","#secondwave"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Sybren Renema on August 21, 2020.","NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598002236,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 11:30:36 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Guru TK Kemala Bhayangkari 19 Cabang Parepare Daerah Sulawesi Selatan telah mengoptimalkan pembelajaran melalui metode pembelajaran Daring.\n\n@ketua_pembina_ykb \n@yayasan_kemalabhayangkari \n@anneke_gtr \n@ykb_sulsel \n@yantiaja.80 \n#yayasankemalabhayangkari \n#tkkemalabhayangkari19\n#bhayangkari \n#bhayangkariindonesia \n#bhayangkaripusat \n#pandemic2020 \n#covid19 \n#socialdistancing \n#daring","NumberOfLikes":16,"Hashtags":["#yayasankemalabhayangkari","#tkkemalabhayangkari19","#bhayangkari","#bhayangkariindonesia","#bhayangkaripusat","#pandemic2020","#covid19","#socialdistancing","#daring"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598001082,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 11:11:22 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"I\u2019ve been getting pretty emotional about the parks recently .

The way we flaunted our cooking skills when we \u2018managed\u2019 to make Dosa. Or chappathi? And we hated all those who replied with a photo and an annoying caption- \u201CChicken Pot Biryani: made by me.\u201D\n\n7. When most of us finally got the time to pick up that pen and write down that poem, or to pick up that guitar and sing that song, pick up that book and finish reading it, or just pick up nothing and enjoy being ourselves. Like I said, finally!\n\n8. The clear starry sky which freed itself from volumes of pollution and became the best piece of art to be created. \n\n9. The phone calls we could make after years, the conversations we could complete, the people to whom we could tell how much we love them after much procrastination.\n\n10. The friendships we found in unexpected places, in unexpected people and in unexpected ways which we strongly hope would remain with us forever.\n@sharylss \n.‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nPC: @noone.su \nSHARE YOUR FAVOURITE LOCKDOWN MEMORIES IN THE COMMENTS SECTION. \n.\n#writersofinstagram #writingcommunity #writing #writings #write #writer #writerscommunity #writersofig #writeaway #writersblock #writersnetwork #writeaway #writerssociety #writersuniverse #writersporn #lockdown2020 #lockdown #lockdownlife #covid19 #covid_19 #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife","NumberOfLikes":35,"Hashtags":["#writersofinstagram","#writingcommunity","#writing","#writings","#write","#writer","#writerscommunity","#writersofig","#writeaway","#writersblock","#writersnetwork","#writeaway","#writerssociety","#writersuniverse","#writersporn","#lockdown2020","#lockdown","#lockdownlife","#covid19","#covid_19","#pandemic2020","#pandemiclife"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Sharyl Sodadasi in Listicle.

In a pandemic, to survive tough businesses you need razor-sharp thinking. A must-read book for CEOs, entrepreneurs and start-up founders on how to deal with uncertainty. Author Ozan Varol @ozanvarol who served the 2003 Mars Exploration Rovers project, talks about how, \"We're hesitant to think big, reluctant to dance with uncertainty and afraid of failure. These are the bugs.\"\nHere are 7 Secrets of How to Think Like a Rocket Scientist:\nRule 1: Make Doubt your Superpower. Every genius hesitates. We should be fueled not by a desire for a quick catharsis but by intrigue. Where certainty ends, progress begins. Einstein tangoed with uncertainty, conducted imaginative thought experiments and asked questions nobody dared.\nRule 2: Embrace the sense of possibilities, push your limits, explore what is possible.\nRule 3: Question your assumptions. Why you do the things you do. Don't do things that everyone does.\nRule 4: Don't be stuck in systems. They solve problems that don't even exist today.\nRule 5: Create Moonshot goals. Our goals are often safe and cushioned because we fear failure. We have been seduced to thinking flying lower is safer than flying higher.\nRule 6: You must be willing to share your unique ideas with the world, don't be repressed by conformity.\nRule 7: Don't Rulebound Yourself. Ozan writes, \"Research shows we become increasingly rulebound as we grow older. Events begin to rhyme. Days begin to repeat. We repeat the same overworn soundbites, stick to the same job, talk to the same people, watch the same shows. It's choose-your-own-adventure book that always has same ending. Our processes are developed in response to yesterday's troubles, if you don't question it  will impede forward movement.\"\n.\nThink Like A Rocket Scientist is published by Penguin Random House\n#books #book #pandemic #2020 #bookstagram #bookstagrammer #booklover #bookaddict #booknerd #bookreview #booksofinstagram #bookworm #bookgram #booklovers #selfhelp #rules #life #work #think #mind #instamood #insta #newnormal #pandemic2020 #instagood","NumberOfLikes":10,"Hashtags":["#1","#books","#book","#pandemic","#2020","#bookstagram","#bookstagrammer","#booklover","#bookaddict","#booknerd","#bookreview","#booksofinstagram","#bookworm","#bookgram","#booklovers","#selfhelp","#rules","#life","#work","#think","#mind","#instamood","#insta","#newnormal","#pandemic2020","#instagood"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Nona Walia on August 20, 2020 tagging @penguinrandomhouse.

She was working in other spaces as well, being associated with the organization Vida Digna @colectivo.vidadigna\n\nWith COVID-19, her work expanded as she saw her indigenous community members struggle with daily challenges. \n\n\"In addition, we work to strengthen the sense of community belonging by offering COVID-19 prevention workshops and developing community economic projects to support the production of family gardens. In this way, our communities will have access to quality food; one of the most important elements of our culture (agriculture and knowledge of the land) will be recovered, and families will not depend on external markets to have a dignified life,\" says Johanna. \n\"We are confident that this crisis will make us stronger and wiser.

However I also don\u2019t  like to be accused of lying like that and yelling at that cop felt really good. A day later I am shocked at how ready to die I often am but also extremely proud of myself.
