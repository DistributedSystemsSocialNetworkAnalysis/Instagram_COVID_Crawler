Romans 8:28\n\nbut those who hope in the Lord\nwill renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.Isaiah 40:31\n\nBut he said to me, \u201CMy grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.\u201D Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 2 Corinthians 12:9\n\nAnd my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.

I hope it's the same with people in other countries as well,  we cannot fear the virus anymore and stay locked up in our houses , as this is not ending any day soon. \n\nSo it's important that we take care of ourselves as much as we can , beginning from wearing masks to sanitizing our hands. Also it's important to eat healthy food , vegetables and food rich in vitamin C to boost our immunity . Stay away from unhealthy food and try to cook as much as you can at home and carry it to work. \n\nStaying away from parties or crowded places should be kept in mind always. \n\nAs I don't work in a hospital or not looking after Covid patients , so I am using reusable cloth masks , you can make them at home or buy them based on your need. They are much more sustainable and economical. \n\nSo if you guys are interested in mask reviews ,comment down below and I will show some of the cloth masks that I am using during this pandemic and share my experience . \n\n#wearyourmask #pandemic2020 #stayhome #staysafe #eatvitaminceveryday #boostyourimmunity #wearclothmasks #savetheoceans #sustainableliving","NumberOfLikes":28,"Hashtags":["#wearyourmask","#pandemic2020","#stayhome","#staysafe","#eatvitaminceveryday","#boostyourimmunity","#wearclothmasks","#savetheoceans","#sustainableliving"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Tripti Mukherjee on August 22, 2020 tagging @vastramay.

Then the course goes into technical tight woods. After that, into the campus, then back out towards the road along the parking garages. There is some fair and birdiable holes, and some not so much. There is a lot of up and down and side hill, along with guardian trees, low ceilings, and tunnel shots to provide a great mix and challenging course. Also there is multiple different basket types.

Trump has inherited the Death Star of mind manipulation. The digital dictatorship that we have been living under which knows our behaviors better than our own families...and even ourselves.  Even our leader Putin says \u201Cthe nation that leads in AI will be the ruler of the world\u201D \n\nWe are now trapped in a world of mass confusion and hysteria mixed with lies and peppered with our own desperation and fear. Once you come to the realization of what is happening in front of your eyes. You have two choices. Stay silent and afraid and follow the herd to the cliff or begin the process of reeducating yourself on what has been happening to America and it\u2019s people to come to this point in the road of history.  Find the narrative that will help you get through each day. Find a storyline in the facts that helps you to realize the most important lesson of all. \n\nThat we are all in trouble together. Which means we need each other to make it down this road of hell we are on.  And if you can\u2019t understand that simple fact and embrace your truth and humanity. You are already lost.

Man...what a city and people #cuscoperú is. I flew into Cusco on March 9th for what was supposed  to be a simple 9 day exploration through Lima, Cusco and Machu Picchu with the lady. The pandemic hit Peru March 17.  That 9 day trek has now turned into 164 days and counting. Quarantined in Cusco for 3.5 months of it under martial law. What a freakin  experience and wild ride this has been. Nothing could have prepared me for it! But...it hasn't come without its sacrifices, however. To get where you want to go and preserve your personal integrity and accountability along the way sometimes sacrifices need to be made. Chances need to be taken, and sometimes decisions might not be in your own best interest and that's okay, because that's part of adulting. Putting people ahead of yourself feels good. It's not always about you. Because sometimes being able to sleep at night and being happy when you wake up knowing you made the right decision outweighs everything anyone could ever want when it comes to finding internal peace and happiness. The more you put people ahead of yourself, the more you'll know and feel your self worth.

It can severely affect the heart, vessels, nerves, kidney, skin and brain. Studies have shown that SAR-CoV-2 can cause severe damage, even in patients with mild symptoms or those in recovery. Often this damage is detected very late or not at all. People recovering from symptoms noted trouble with concentration, confused thoughts, memory loss, loss of consciousness, seizures, loss of smell and taste, psychosis, anxiety, delirium, trouble focusing, etc. Researchers found that one-way COVID attacks the body is by causing inflammation and swelling of the brain. \n\nBecause of significant involvement of lungs (prolonged ventilators, tracheostomy and dyspnea), nerve damage, and nervous system dysfunction (encephalopathy, stroke, seizure, psychiatric changes, etc.) Cognitive, Speech, Language and Swallowing difficulties are observed in individuals positive with COVID-19. A Speech-Language Pathologist (SLP) can help with the mentioned problems.\n\n⭐COMMUNICATION: When on ventilator\/tracheostomy and individual is unble to voice,SLP can provide with alternative methods of communication. Some individuals post stroke\/encephalopathy have slurred speech (Dysarthria) or language difficulty (Aphasia) which requires help with communication and expression.\n\n⭐SWALLOWING: Breathing tube, vocal cord damage, fluids in lungs, in-coordination or weakness of throat and oral muscles can cause significant swallowing difficulties and requires prompt intervention by an SLP.\n\n⭐COGNITION: With cognitive functions (memory, problem solving, reasoning, attention etc) affected, an SLP can step in with strategies and early intervention.\n.\n.\n.\n#covid19 #covid19india #covid #coronavirus #pandemic #pandemic2020 #speechlanguagetherapy #speechtherapy #languagetherapy #swallowtherapy #dysphagiatherapy #slp #slpsofinstagram #speech #language #cognition #swallowing #aphasia #dysarthria #dysphagia #cognitiveimpairment #tracheostomy #ventilator #encephalopathy #memoryloss #lossoftasteandsmell #nervedamage #seizures #mumbai #fixmyspeech","NumberOfLikes":21,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#covid19india","#covid","#coronavirus","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#speechlanguagetherapy","#speechtherapy","#languagetherapy","#swallowtherapy","#dysphagiatherapy","#slp","#slpsofinstagram","#speech","#language","#cognition","#swallowing","#aphasia","#dysarthria","#dysphagia","#cognitiveimpairment","#tracheostomy","#ventilator","#encephalopathy","#memoryloss","#lossoftasteandsmell","#nervedamage","#seizures","#mumbai","#fixmyspeech"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by All About Speech Therapy in Mumbai, Maharashtra.

The masks? Children home from everything? Not enough time in the day? 🤚 Too much time? The politics? The fear? Maybe the lack of TP! \n\nLast night I fed my kids Mr Noodles for dinner so I could work out. \nThat was my coping. I haven\u2019t been consistent because somebody or some animal is usually in need of ALL OF my time. \nI had to make a sacrifice somewhere because I crave working out. It gives me that wonderful release of endorphins. It makes me feel accomplished. It makes me feel strong and healthy and happy. I\u2019ve been ignoring my body\u2019s unhappiness in order to give to others. \n\nMy back has been sore from being unprotected from my weak core muscles, working nights and lifting patients. There is more to me that touches uncomfortably and gets in the way of other things. My body wants to run, wants to move. Wants to feel exerted. \nFarm work and riding and a leisurely bike ride aren\u2019t enough for me, I need that strenuous physical activity. \n\nSo last night instead of cooking a meal from scratch, I let the kids have Mr Noodles. And it\u2019s totally ok. ONCE IN AWHILE. \nEven with that, I didn\u2019t have time to change into workout clothes, put a bra on, warm up or cool down.

The bench, headed by Justice Sanjay K Kaul, took a grim view of such unsubstantiated claims and the very filing of such a PIL in the apex court.\n\nIt was of the view that the direction sought in Gyantara's PIL were completely misconceived and that it was time to send a message that people should not approach a court with such contentions.\n\nThe bench, which also had Justices Ajay Rastogi and Aniruddha Bose, further noted that the primary consideration of the petitioner in filing such a petition seemed to be getting some attention and publicity.\n\n\"We are of the view that such kind of petitions must be stopped as anybody and everybody thinks they have some cure for the situation,\" it maintained.\n\nThe court, in its order on Thursday, added that such petitioners seek to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution, possibly only to gain some publicity.\n\n\"Such wastage of judicial time is completely inappropriate,\" held the bench.

This painting is one of the greatest masterpieces in Western art and caps an entire tradition of Medieval depictions of suffering, just before the Reformation would kick in. It was made for a hospital where plague sufferers and those with skin disease were treated, which is why Christ is covered in sores. This would allow the patients a feeling that they were not alone in heading towards their painful and unhygenic ending. Grünewald's painting feels very out of place and out of time, even for the time it was made in. That is its strength, because it allows an atheist like myself to get inspiration from it five centuries later. \n\nOne artist who was much inspired by Grünewald was the amazing composer Paul Hindemith. In the 1930s, as Germany was spiralling out of control, he composed an opera based on Grünewald and the Peasants Rebellion of 1525. Matis der Maler is rarely performed, but includes actors posing as the painting and lots of soul-searching arias about the position of the artist in a war-torn Germany. It was evidently banned, and Hindemith left for America. The image above is a still from a 1950s performance of the opera, which was printed on a postcard.\n\nI have made my computer calculate what the picture would look like without heads. This leaves just bodies, dramatic shadows and empty hand gestures on a stage. But then again history repeats itself, first as a tragedy, then as a farce. Only greatness like that of Grünewald is a constant, as are the ever-fainter echoes of our complicated cultural histories. And of course headless chickens, they are constants too. \n\nOh! Guess who else is from Colmar? Bartholdi, who built the Statue of Liberty. The psychogeography is off the scale.\n\n#matisdermaler #paulhindemith #matthiasgrünewald #grünewald #grunewald #2020 #2020art #pandemic2020 #pandemicart #isenheimeraltar #colmarfrance #opera #sybrenrenema #hindemith #artandmusic #musicandart #classicalmusic #renaissanceart #cuiusregioeiusreligio #headlesschicken #secondwave","NumberOfLikes":12,"Hashtags":["#matisdermaler","#paulhindemith","#matthiasgrünewald","#grünewald","#grunewald","#2020","#2020art","#pandemic2020","#pandemicart","#isenheimeraltar","#colmarfrance","#opera","#sybrenrenema","#hindemith","#artandmusic","#musicandart","#classicalmusic","#renaissanceart","#cuiusregioeiusreligio","#headlesschicken","#secondwave"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Sybren Renema on August 21, 2020.","NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598002236,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 11:30:36 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Guru TK Kemala Bhayangkari 19 Cabang Parepare Daerah Sulawesi Selatan telah mengoptimalkan pembelajaran melalui metode pembelajaran Daring.\n\n@ketua_pembina_ykb \n@yayasan_kemalabhayangkari \n@anneke_gtr \n@ykb_sulsel \n@yantiaja.80 \n#yayasankemalabhayangkari \n#tkkemalabhayangkari19\n#bhayangkari \n#bhayangkariindonesia \n#bhayangkaripusat \n#pandemic2020 \n#covid19 \n#socialdistancing \n#daring","NumberOfLikes":16,"Hashtags":["#yayasankemalabhayangkari","#tkkemalabhayangkari19","#bhayangkari","#bhayangkariindonesia","#bhayangkaripusat","#pandemic2020","#covid19","#socialdistancing","#daring"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598001082,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 11:11:22 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"I\u2019ve been getting pretty emotional about the parks recently .

Those morning or evening walks which didn\u2019t need a workout playlist. The silence from having less people on the road, the birds chirping, the leaves rustling, became all the music we would ever need. \n\n4. Movie Sessions with the whole family when Mom would see the rating of the movie on Netflix and immediately say, \u201CThat movie has s... search for another one.\u201D No amount of whining and the assurance to forward \u2018those\u2019 scenes would change her mind. \n\n5.

And we hated all those who replied with a photo and an annoying caption- \u201CChicken Pot Biryani: made by me.\u201D\n\n7.

The phone calls we could make after years, the conversations we could complete, the people to whom we could tell how much we love them after much procrastination.\n\n10.

In a pandemic, to survive tough businesses you need razor-sharp thinking. A must-read book for CEOs, entrepreneurs and start-up founders on how to deal with uncertainty. Author Ozan Varol @ozanvarol who served the 2003 Mars Exploration Rovers project, talks about how, \"We're hesitant to think big, reluctant to dance with uncertainty and afraid of failure. These are the bugs.\"\nHere are 7 Secrets of How to Think Like a Rocket Scientist:\nRule 1: Make Doubt your Superpower. Every genius hesitates. We should be fueled not by a desire for a quick catharsis but by intrigue. Where certainty ends, progress begins. Einstein tangoed with uncertainty, conducted imaginative thought experiments and asked questions nobody dared.\nRule 2: Embrace the sense of possibilities, push your limits, explore what is possible.\nRule 3: Question your assumptions. Why you do the things you do. Don't do things that everyone does.\nRule 4: Don't be stuck in systems. They solve problems that don't even exist today.\nRule 5: Create Moonshot goals. Our goals are often safe and cushioned because we fear failure. We have been seduced to thinking flying lower is safer than flying higher.\nRule 6: You must be willing to share your unique ideas with the world, don't be repressed by conformity.\nRule 7: Don't Rulebound Yourself. Ozan writes, \"Research shows we become increasingly rulebound as we grow older. Events begin to rhyme. Days begin to repeat. We repeat the same overworn soundbites, stick to the same job, talk to the same people, watch the same shows. It's choose-your-own-adventure book that always has same ending. Our processes are developed in response to yesterday's troubles, if you don't question it  will impede forward movement.\"\n.\nThink Like A Rocket Scientist is published by Penguin Random House\n#books #book #pandemic #2020 #bookstagram #bookstagrammer #booklover #bookaddict #booknerd #bookreview #booksofinstagram #bookworm #bookgram #booklovers #selfhelp #rules #life #work #think #mind #instamood #insta #newnormal #pandemic2020 #instagood","NumberOfLikes":10,"Hashtags":["#1","#books","#book","#pandemic","#2020","#bookstagram","#bookstagrammer","#booklover","#bookaddict","#booknerd","#bookreview","#booksofinstagram","#bookworm","#bookgram","#booklovers","#selfhelp","#rules","#life","#work","#think","#mind","#instamood","#insta","#newnormal","#pandemic2020","#instagood"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Nona Walia on August 20, 2020 tagging @penguinrandomhouse.

Avoid using mobile phones and computers apart from work hours. Take regular breaks between long hours spend on digital device.\n\n🔹Indugle in Offline activites: Grab a book, play a sport or take a walk \n\n🔹Use a eye protection such as blue cut lenses\n\n🔹Be mindful of blue light at night: The blue light emitted from our screens can trick our brains into thinking its still daylight. Try to limit screen time at night.\n\n🔹Follow 20-20-20 rule: For every 20 minutes spent using a screen, you should try to look away at something that is 20 feet away from you for a total of 20 seconds.\n\n🔹Nourish them with right nutrition: All the above tips will work only if you eat foods that help in better vision which includes: \n\n🌽🥕🥬Green leafy, yellow, red and orange color fruits and vegetables which are rich in beta carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin\n\n🍓🍊Berries and Citrus fruits which are packed with vit C\n\n🥜Nuts like almonds which will provide zinc and vit E\n\n🍣Salmon and other fatty fishes for Omega -3 fatty acids \n\nMost of the mentioned nutrients like vit A, vit C,  vit E act as antioxidants.

I try to avoid it, just like arguing. So much so that there\u2019s many of times even if a person deserves for me to yell at them I won\u2019t. There was a point in time I enjoyed yelling, it\u2019s also when I had no problem lying. I don\u2019t like yelling at cops because no matter what something\u2019s wrong when someone is doing that. However I also don\u2019t  like to be accused of lying like that and yelling at that cop felt really good. A day later I am shocked at how ready to die I often am but also extremely proud of myself. That cop was bullying me, causing me harm and while I have handled other situations different and would likely, that\u2019s exactly what I should of done. Maybe it was the being born premature, maybe that\u2019s I\u2019ve always generally felt at peace with \u201Cgod\u201D or death, with both it could be said I dint seek it but  generally not afraid of it.

И высыпаться - это очень важно. И сериалы тоже сами себя не посмотрят.⠀\n⠀\nНо пару месяцев назад абсолютно случайно я увидела в Инстаграме аккаунт @amapola_esp и решила, что это знак: когда как не сейчас - лучшее время мне занять себя чем-то полезным? ⠀\n⠀\nУже с первых же занятий на курсе для начинающих я поняла, что моя проблема в изучении испанского (и я, собственно, предполагала, что так и будет) заключается во...владении английским 🤦\u200D♀️⠀\n⠀\nЯ говорю и переписываюсь на английском несколько часов в день каждый день и уже много лет смотрю фильмы и сериалы только с оригинальной озвучкой.
