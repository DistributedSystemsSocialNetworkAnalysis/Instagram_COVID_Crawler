Most people infected will experience a mild to moderate respiratory illness, whilst others will show no symptoms at all. However for some the effects are severe and longer lasting.\n\nOur aim in this yoga programme is to play some role in aiding the process of recovery. By only requiring the use of mostly basic props and furniture, we have tried to make the poses as accessible as possible for everyone.\n\nThe programme was compiled thanks to advice and guidance from Abhijata Iyengar, Lois Steinberg, Gulnaaz Dashti, Stephanie Quirk, the IY(UK) Therapy Committee, IY(UK) teachers who have experienced the virus themselves, and decades of work by BKS Iyengar and Dr Geeta S. Iyengar in medical classes at RIMYI in Pune.\n\nSee the link in our bio to access the video and booklet, which are both freely available.

If you watch my stories than you know that I am in a terrible situation when it comes to housing right now. Due to the pandemic we have to move like immediately, we didn\u2019t get approved for the loan to buy the house since the landlord wants to sell, and the rental market is terrible. I had a mini breakdown yesterday. I started thinking about how I ALWAYS do everything by the book and things just don\u2019t work out for me.

I\u2019ve spent my entire life working as hard as I can, getting all straight a\u2019s, working multiple jobs, and still I always fall short because of something from my past. Both of my parents have passed away, so I don\u2019t have anyone to help me co-sign for loans, or lend me a few dollars if I need it, or teach me how to build credit or apply for a mortgage. My mom let her addiction get the best of her and she started me off with terrible credit when I turned 18 by using my SSN to sign up for cards, gas and electric.. the list goes on. I\u2019ve been trying to work off the disadvantages growing up in extreme poverty with addict parents my entire life.. and it\u2019s fucking hard. My life has been full of struggles, unbelievable stories, things you only see in the movies.. and I could have let it ruin me. But I just let it fuel my fire. Some days I just want to throw in the towel, but then I think about what I\u2019ve already been able to survive. You can get through ANYTHING with hope. It\u2019s not as easy as \u201Cworking hard\u201D, and it won\u2019t always be a straight path, but if you never give up on yourself, I promise you it will just make you more and more unbreakable every single time.

It isn\u2019t a house or a building....it\u2019s a simple set of municipal steps called \u201CThe Music Box Steps\u201D - named after the classic 1932 Laurel and Hardy comedy short called \u201CThe Music Box\u201D!\n\nThe steps, which are the focal point of this hilarious film, still exist in the Silver Lake district of Los Angeles, near the Laurel and Hardy Park!! The steps are a public staircase that connects Vendome Street (at the base of the hill) with Descanso Drive (at the top of the hill), and are located at \u202A923-925 North Vendome Street\u202C near the intersection of Del Monte Drive. A plaque commemorating the film was set into one of the lower steps! \n\nIf you\u2019ve never seen this laugh-out-loud film it\u2019s arguably the famous comedy duo\u2019s most iconic work! The slapstick short\u2019s most memorable scene is a string of gags involving the duo attempting to move a massive piano up a long flight of stairs. In short, they\u2019re absolutely terrible at it. Lol \n\nFYI - Without a piano, these steps aren\u2019t such a tough climb \u2014 it\u2019s comprised of 133 steps with multiple landings.\n\nThis legendary short film comedy won the first Academy Award for Best Live Action Short (Comedy) in 1932. In 1997, the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress!\n\nFun facts - The crate that Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy wrestle with was empty, but the one shown sliding down the staircase really did have an upright piano in it. As it careens down the steps muffled, discordant tones can be heard.\n\nThe idea for the film came to a Hal Roach comedy writer in 1927 when he passed a long flight of stairs in the Silverlake area of L.A. and thought it would be a good idea to have Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy trying to move something heavy up them. \n\nThis was Laurel and Hardy\u2019s only Oscar-winning film together. \u201CThe Music Box\u201D was one of Stan's' personal favorites. Stan kept this Oscar in his apartment in Santa Monica, and he called it \u2018Mr. Clean\u2019. üòÇüòÇüòÇ #filminglocation #themusicboxsteps #silverlake #laurelandhardy #hollywoodtour #pandemic2020 #socialdistancing #wearamask #tonymiros","NumberOfLikes":45,"Hashtags":["#filminglocation","#themusicboxsteps","#silverlake","#laurelandhardy","#hollywoodtour","#pandemic2020","#socialdistancing","#wearamask","#tonymiros"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1597860285,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 19 20:04:45 CEST 2020","Location":"Laurel And Hardy steps In \"The Music Box\""},{"Owner":"groundreportbyaman","CaptionText":"People are going back to their normal  lives as nothing is getting normal\n.\n.\n#yourshotphotographer #biharfloods #pandemic2020 #natgeointhefield #worldpressphoto #reuters \n #wpp #wpp2020 #bihar #pandemic #snapwithpankaj  #gun_eat  #anotherelement  #nvedi #rudqp \n#whatkarlloves #_coi #gangariver #blackandwhitephotography #latak #lallantop","NumberOfLikes":40,"Hashtags":["#yourshotphotographer","#biharfloods","#pandemic2020","#natgeointhefield","#worldpressphoto","#reuters","#wpp","#wpp2020","#bihar","#pandemic","#snapwithpankaj","#gun_eat","#anotherelement","#nvedi","#rudqp","#whatkarlloves","#_coi","#gangariver","#blackandwhitephotography","#latak","#lallantop"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Aman in Digha, BihƒÅr, India.

Time for a pandemic check in. For many of us, we've spent 5 months mostly stuck in our homes. For me, sometimes it just feels normal. Other times I feel trapped or claustrophobic or angry or sad. (On rough days, all of those at once.)\n\nIt's hard. There's no way for it to be easy.\n\nBut in case you haven't gotten outside much lately, I want to remind you: nature is so healing. \n\nI took this picture on a hike with my family a couple of weeks ago. It was SO HOT and I was red-faced and sweaty and tired, so I'm not hitting you with some kind of magical perfection here. But despite the heat, I was restored by the sky, the trees, the river I swam in later that day, the hawks that flew right over my head.\n\nOn days when it feels like too much, take a walk. If you can go to some green space, even better. Or just go outside, watch the sky for 10 minutes, and put your bare feet on the earth. I think you'll feel better.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#nature #naturetherapy #naturemedicine #getoutside #stressrelief #stressmanagement #pandemic #pandemic2020 #covid19 #grounding","NumberOfLikes":17,"Hashtags":["#nature","#naturetherapy","#naturemedicine","#getoutside","#stressrelief","#stressmanagement","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#covid19","#grounding"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Arden Yingling, MAcOM, LAc on August 19, 2020.

It gives us time to pause, re-evaluate where we are and where we want to be going and refocus on what\u2019s really important.\n\u2063\nLife can get crazy and it\u2019s so easy to get caught up in the day to day. The silver lining of a world pandemic is that it forces us to take a look at the bigger picture.\n\u2063\nWhile there\u2019s no doubt we still have hard days ahead, my hope is that we can all come out stronger, wiser, and more giving then we\u2019ve ever been before.\n\u2063\nStay safe and sane out there ‚ù§Ô∏è","NumberOfLikes":35,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Samantha Carvalho Design on August 18, 2020.

Even during \u201Cnormal\u201D times it can be hard to manage. So the idea of jumping back into it under these crazy new circumstances was totally overwhelming! \n\nIn order to curb my anxiety, I came up with a few coping strategies:\n\n1Ô∏è\u20E3 One route at a time \n\nIt was much less stressful for me to imagine starting back out on the road with a short trip to a set destination, rather than simply jumping back into an ongoing way of life. \n\nIn other words, in order to relaunch I needed to know I was heading toward another safe harbor. I wanted a specific vision to look forward to if things got tough in between. \n\nOnce we got to our first destination, we could plan another route, and another one after that, and so on and so on . . . but I needed to approach it in increments. \n\n2Ô∏è\u20E3 Be ready to be flexible \n\nI reminded myself to let go of all expectations and try to take things as they come. To set plans in jello, and have plenty of back-up ideas. \n\nIf a location didn\u2019t feel right or wasn\u2019t comfortable for us for any reason - we could always just move right along, or even re-route entirely! \n\nThat\u2019s the beauty of traveling WITH your home. \n\n3Ô∏è\u20E3 Go easy on ourselves \n\nThis wasn\u2019t the time to push ourselves; it was the time to err on the side of caution. \n\nAlso my mantra: keep everything as SIMPLE as possible. \n\nThings are going to be challenging enough just trying to keep three kids under five socially distanced from other people while traveling (and keep them from sticking random things in their mouths, among other non-virus-friendly habits). \n\nAnother pep-talk I gave us: Just do what we can, and don\u2019t stress about what we can\u2019t! \n\nüíô‚ù§Ô∏èüíö\n\nDid any of you all get off the road in order to lock down for a bit, and if so are you back on now? \n\nWhat were\/are some of YOUR on-the-road-during-a-pandemic strategies?","NumberOfLikes":239,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Three Little Trees in Home Sweet Home.

We will be releasing it via YouTube on September 1st and it will be in a recorded webinar format. \n.\nOther webinars will discuss the link between animal agriculture and our health as well as a video discussing the role the animal agriculture industry has played in environmental destruction and climate change.\n.\nStay tuned!!\n.\n.\n.\n#socialjustice #socialjusticewarrior #pandemic2020 #pandemic #health #wellness #animalagriculture #environment #disease #cardiovascularhealth #immunehealth #plantbasednutrition #plantbasedfitness #plantbasedlife #nutrition #nutritionist #healthyliving #healthnotdiets #ecofriendly #smallbusiness","NumberOfLikes":9,"Hashtags":["#socialjustice","#socialjusticewarrior","#pandemic2020","#pandemic","#health","#wellness","#animalagriculture","#environment","#disease","#cardiovascularhealth","#immunehealth","#plantbasednutrition","#plantbasedfitness","#plantbasedlife","#nutrition","#nutritionist","#healthyliving","#healthnotdiets","#ecofriendly","#smallbusiness"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597790386,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 19 00:39:46 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"mask_incompetence","CaptionText":"Not only is this horrible mask etiquette, he scanned every single CD!

There's a famous story from, perhaps apocryphal, where a Spanish fascist was asked to speak at an international fascism conference in the early '30s. And he said, \"I'm not a fascist \u2014 I'm Spanish.\" Fascism, because it's based on nationalism, is always going to take the most sort of crude and tense form of the nation's traditional tropes. So German fascism, you know, you would have, you know, people with the most Baroque, traditional German name. They'd be dressed in very traditional, kitschy German outfits \u2014 traditional Bavarian outfit. So fascism in the United States would look like that: It would be wrapped in a Confederate flag; it would be wrapped in the vestiges of American ultranationalism, which is white nationalism.\n\nClick Like\nFollow\nI LOVE ‚ù§Ô∏è YOU\nMy Tribe!\n#THEBOX\n#covid19\n#pandemic2020 #comediansofinstagram #detroit #wakeup #truth #mytruths #K2.0 #THENEXTBIGIDEA #STORYTELLING #DETROIT #THEWORLD #HUMANITY #EVERYONESBEAUTIFUL\u2063\n\u2063#KirkNoland #videoproducer #instagram #follow #interviews #detroitartist #detroitdirector #creativedirector #THEBOX #comedian #The Box #mentalhealthawareness #suicideprevention #pandemic2020 #quarantinelife #coronavirus #quarantinelife #THETRUTHSTANDSALONE","NumberOfLikes":1,"Hashtags":["#THEBOX","#covid19","#pandemic2020","#comediansofinstagram","#detroit","#wakeup","#truth","#mytruths","#K2.0","#THENEXTBIGIDEA","#STORYTELLING","#DETROIT","#THEWORLD","#HUMANITY","#EVERYONESBEAUTIFUL\u2063","#KirkNoland","#videoproducer","#instagram","#follow","#interviews","#detroitartist","#detroitdirector","#creativedirector","#THEBOX","#comedian","#The","#mentalhealthawareness","#suicideprevention","#pandemic2020","#quarantinelife","#coronavirus","#quarantinelife","#THETRUTHSTANDSALONE"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by kirknolandthebox.com on August 18, 2020.

Let me explain the picture on this post. For the moment I live in South Korea (no Im not Korean) , this picture was taken at my local gym on August 19th. On the left side of the pic we have a column that depicts a person that is infected with Covid-19. On the right side we have a peson that is not infected with Covid-19. Now according to this propaganda piece of laminated paper, if you and the infected person are wearing a mask the possibility of infection is 1.5%. If the infected and the none infected are not wearing a mask then the possibility of infection is 100%. Now I dont know if any of you remember this but around 5 months ago the WHO was against wearing a mask and even said that wearing a mask doesn't protect you from the virus. They were right but as soon as Trump dropped financial aid support for the WHO , they sided with communist China and changed their mindset regarding the mask. The mask doesn't protect you from shit, that is the point of this posting. It only slowly poisons your lungs by breathing your own C02. The mask is only a symbol of communist compliance to the government, that is the only purpose for it. \n\nNow for my fellow Koreans, please wake up! Stop believing the mainstream news, stop watching your apps about infected people, those numbers are fake most of the time. Even if you die from a heart attack some hospitals are labeling the cause of death as Covid-19 in order to get funding. Stop trusting your government, they are best friends with communist China and have no interest in fixing this situation at all other than continuing on inposing this stupid rules. Yeah Korea is safe from the chaos in the West, but nothing last forever and soon Korea will fall into civil unrest...people can only take so much before they explode and decide that enough is fucking enough!! The mask is a symbol of communism plain and simple.

But recently I\u2019ve heard more and more stories about the detrimental effect the pandemic has had on small, local businesses, specifically those that thrive off tourism. I\u2019ve watched as my own country gets torn apart, and people lose hope in leadership and one another. I\u2019ve felt disconnected from my country, my planet, at times even myself. \n\nI\u2019m tired of sitting at home, feeling helpless.

There are plenty of hurdles before any new invention can hit the market, but the team seems quite gung-ho about their prospects.\n\n#masks #facemasks #covid #covid19awareness #nanomaterial #sarscov2 #sars #covid19 #N95masks #microorganisms #virus #pandemic2020 #epidemic #pharmacist #pharmafacts #factspharma #factsonly #didyouknowfact #pharmfacts","NumberOfLikes":13,"Hashtags":["#masks","#facemasks","#covid","#covid19awareness","#nanomaterial","#sarscov2","#sars","#covid19","#N95masks","#microorganisms","#virus","#pandemic2020","#epidemic","#pharmacist","#pharmafacts","#factspharma","#factsonly","#didyouknowfact","#pharmfacts"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by PharmaClass on August 18, 2020.

Just a minute\u2019s scroll through your Instagram will be enough to give you ideas on what to do as you\u2019re locked inside your home. Cooking, fitness, online courses and what not! \nBut is it really as fun as it sounds? How many times did that minute scroll through Instagram become a painful reminder of you feeling like you haven\u2019t achieved anything? Worry not, you\u2019re not alone. We\u2019ve all been there \u2013 munching on a bag of chips while watching Chloe Ting\u2019s Ab workout. It almost seems like there is an added obligation to make it through the pandemic with superhuman powers. And sometimes, that can hit too close to home. \nLet this post be a reminder to you that what you\u2019re going through only happens once in every hundred years. Don\u2019t ever feel like you\u2019re not doing enough. You\u2019ve been placed in unprecedented conditions and just because your friend, an Instagram influencer or a stranger might be handling it better than you, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re weak for having a tougher time. Going through it is enough. You\u2019re entitled to your time to get used to it, loathe it and make peace with it.

We were able to walk around and play with a lot of canes, climb up the rocks to become the pirates and see the enemies in the distance.
