This is evident within the United States as COVID-19 and structural racism coinfect our communities. In a short period of time, the novel coronavirus has mutated in its pursuits to circulate and infect human life. U.S. racial domination has also mutated, albeit over a much longer span of time, adapting from earlier forms of chattel slavery, Jim Crow segregation and 'colorblind' multiculturalism. In this moment, we witness racism\u2019s altered expressions in the heightened disdain for Black humanity, the systematic detention of immigrant children, revamped expressions of anti-Asian xenophobia and shameless enunciations of white supremacy. While communities continue in their struggle against structural racism \u2014 including a rising Black-led youth movement calling to defund the police \u2014 there is optimism that the development of a coronavirus vaccine can free us from this global pandemic. Yet, even if a vaccine were to be safely manufactured in a timeline unprecedented in human history, it cannot save us from COVID apartheid.\"\u2060\n\u2060\nClick the link in our bio for the full article.\u2060\n(Photo: Mario Tama \/ Getty Images)","NumberOfLikes":117,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Truthout on August 17, 2020.

How are you and your children feeling about going back?\u2060\n.\u2060\nWhen I sent Little Man back to nursery in July I was so worried. Was it safe? Would the changes they'd made freak him out? Would he be happy? How would he adapt after so long at home? Would he get upset going back? Was I being selfish sending him back so I could work? Should I just keep him at home with me? So many questions running through my mind, and so much time spent weighing up the pros and cons. So I understand how it must feel (for both you and your children) now you're preparing to send your children back to school after 5 months at home under such weird circumstances. \u2060\n.\u2060\nThat's why I'm offering 10% off my entire hug range from now until the end of the month, including these squishy hug buttons. Hug Buttons were invented by a mum as a way of comforting her child who was anxious about starting school. She drew a heart on her hand, and a heart on the hand of her son and if he felt lonely or sad whilst at school he could 'press' the button which would then send a hug! These squishy hugs offer a physical form of comfort for children who may be missing a loved one whilst at school, nursery or while their loved one is at work. To take advantage of the offer simply head to my Etsy shop (the link is in my bio). You don't need any codes, the discount is applied automatically. \u2060\n. \u2060\nOh and Little Man absolutely loved being back at nursery. He's completely flourished since he's been back and comes home every day he's there full of everything he's done and who he's played with. I think the transition back was harder for me than him! \u2060\n.\u2060\n#backtoschool #backtoschool2020 #schoolsreopening #endoflockdown #lockdown2020 #socialdistancing #transitionphase #backtonormality #thenewnormal #pandemic2020 #hugbuttons #handmadehugs #backtoschooloffer #handmadecomforts #snugglehugs #hugbuddy #cuddlytoy #pockethug #parentingthroughapandemic #thisisparenthood #shopsmall #shoplocal #summerholidays #schoolprep #etsyuk #etsyseller #etsyshop #discount #salenowon #shopnow\u2060","NumberOfLikes":18,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Handmade Unique Toys in Newcastle upon Tyne.

This year has taken the world by storm, fire and water quite literally. Some things aren\u2019t within our control and that\u2019s really mostly all of 2020.\n.\nHowever, there is so much that we still are capable of and that is where I believe we underestimate ourselves. To be part of the world that struggles and yet revives, to stand up a little stronger, cling on to hope a little tighter and hold on to faith a little deeper. To go all out and donate generously, empathise passionately and help fervently. To believe there is one overlooking all of this despair and absolutely nothing happens without his knowledge. That no matter how bad it gets, you will get through this , for no soul shall be burdened more than he can bear.\n.\nLook at the glorious skies and enwrap yourself with the beauty of this world. Soak yourself in the warmth of the horizon for it does leave you with a sense of gratitude, hope and faith.\nWhile we wake up each day to something that breaks our heart yet again, know that there are also stories of joy and happiness witnessing that very moment. And for every heartbreak, we have a little something we can offer to the world. And that, we must.\nWith time, the broken too shall heal.\nThe world shall heal.\nYou shall heal.\nIn sha Allah♥️\n..\n#musingsofahijabi #holdontohope #roadtorecovery #ayeartoremember #prayforbeirut #prayfortheworld #gratefulthankfulblessed #pandemic2020 #uaebloggers #writersofinstagram #dubaiblogger #hijabibloggers #momsofinstagram #momsofdubai #dubaimoms #dubaimums #kitebeachdubai #horizonviews #2020pleasebekind #momsofdubai #writersofdubai #fortheloveofwriting","NumberOfLikes":210,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by 𝓐𝓶𝓻𝓮𝓮𝓷 in Kite Beach Dubai.

I know this may seem like its getting old when I say this but it\u2019s so freakin essential people. Exercise is THE BEST COPING MECHANISM PERIOD. Without it I guarantee I and many others around me would be depressed and anxious. Exercise helps me deal with life\u2019s shortcomings and improves the one and only vessel I will ever own. Exercise makes me want to put better foods into my body. \n\nExercise stimulates the release of endogenous opioid peptides responsible for changes in our mood, anxiety, and performance.\n\nExercise also triggers Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor(BDNF) that is like fertilizer for our brains. BDNF helps maintain the life and growth of our brain cells. Low levels of BDNF have been associated with depression, anxiety, poor memory and brain degeneration as seen in conditions such as Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia.\n\nExercise in moderate amounts also helps support your microbiome due to its stress reducing effects. Moderate Exercise increases the number of beneficial microbial species and enriches microbial diversity as well as enhanced short-chain fatty acid synthesis and carbohydrate metabolism that promotes the function of your intestinal lining thus improving the regulation of your immune system.\n\nI could go on and on and would put exercise as just as important as eating the right foods. It will help you become your best self. Little by little day by day add in just another minute of exercise. Many people exercise like they do diets. Being extreme for a bit then falling off the wagon. Exercise and eating what\u2019s right for your body are life-style changes you should slowly adapt to. Life is a marathon, not a sprint.","NumberOfLikes":47,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Lucas McCabe on August 17, 2020.

There were many positives like double-pained windows, air conditioning in the bedroom, and the fabulous rooftop garden terrace. However it was very small, which was not an issue when I rented it in February and was out most of the time, but became a big issue when CV19 caused a lockdown.  Plus, it was a very new modern apartment and I tend to prefer something older with charm, character and heart.\n💝\nMy apartment in Patzcuaro is amazing! I am across the street from a Buddhist retreat center. I have a large private courtyard; my puppy and I spend a lot of time out there. There is a second bedroom, a laundry room, and a very sweet atrium\/meditation room off the kitchen. When I got rid of most of my possessions before moving to Mexico, letting go of my art collection was difficult. My current landlord is an art collector so my apartment is full of art and handmade furniture. My upstairs neighbor is very friendly and kind. When I had a root canal the 2nd week I was here, she made me homemade carrot ginger soup. She has taken me to her favorite places and introduced me to her friends. She is in love with my puppy and frequently comes down to the courtyard to play with Zooey. \n💝\nSpirit found me the perfect place to live \u2014 it checked all my boxes \u2014 nurturing, inspiring, relaxing, great central location, and recharges me.  Even more amazing ........ my apartment, all utilities, drinking water and wifi is less than $250 USD per month!\n🤗\nI would love to hear about your ideal living space or changes you have made to cope more effectively with living through the pandemic. 🌻\n#expatlife #traveltheworld #womenwhotravel #expatlifestyle #wanderlust #solotravel #solotraveler #mexico #patzuaro #inspirational #followyourdreams #followyourbliss #livingthroughlockdown #authentic #authenticliving #nurturing #healthylifestyle #artcollections #midlife #agingredefined #pandemic2020 #artinaging #travels #ideal #quarantinelife #embraceyourlife #copingwithcovid19 #healthyliving","NumberOfLikes":45,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":30,"Timestamp":1597679252,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 17:47:32 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"👉👉FOLLOW @an.art.insider @an.art.insider @an.art.insider☑️☑️\n.\nTag us or use #anartinsider  to get featured.☑️☑️\n.\n#artmemes #artmeme #art #meme #artistmemes #artistoninstagram #drawingmeme#helpingmeme #artworkmeme #memestagram #memestudio #studentiincrisi #universitymemes #memeillustration #memes😂 #memeworld #likeforlike #likeforlikes #followartist #artpage #artistfeature #pandemic2020 #memepages #freesketch #freeart #lockdown","NumberOfLikes":60,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by 𝘼𝙉.𝘼𝙍𝙏.𝙄𝙉𝙎𝙄𝘿𝙀𝙍 \u2022 𝘼𝙍𝙏 𝙈𝙀𝙈𝙀𝙎 in Art Memes.

Especially for those of us that have mental health issues anyway. I get that self-care is important, and you have to be careful, but we can't let that make us ignore things that need to be acknowledged and fixed in our society, our governments, & ourselves.

Discussing this can help you learn how to cope, what you truly do need to avoid, and may even uncover the underlying issues for your anxiety and stress, all of which you can then work on.

I feel like I have a part of him with that name tag. It sits on my dresser. \n\nHe was funny. He loved to crack jokes, he loved to write. He liked to philosophize all the time. His coworkers recorded him on Facebook when they were at lunch one day and he was philosophizing about something stupid. I really love the things his coworkers put on Facebook because I can go back and look at them. \n\nHis coworkers have been great. They started calling and texting me. They bought t-shirts with his face on it and had \"T-shirt Friday\u201D at work because he and another gentleman passed away. So they either had on the other guy's t-shirt or they had on my brother's t-shirt. And they sent me a picture and it just meant so much to me because my brother was private so I didn't know he had so many friends. \n\nHe passed away on March 29th. He was a diabetic. He had had amputations. So something might have been wrong with his diabetes, and then he got coronavirus on top of that. \n\nPeople put their lives at risk all the time as essential workers. These are the little people who don't make a bunch of money, but they do a service for you. So don't ever forget them because a lot of the people at Walmart work at the back of Walmart, so you'll never see them.

Generational conditioning (probably not the correct term, but my brain fogged brain is saying we're using it) is a large part of how old ways of thinking are able to survive the years. Which can be okay when you're talking about things that help us keep a civilized society, but can be really bad when bias and hate are also thrown in there under the guise of \"it's how things are,\" or other \"lessons\" that teach good things but then have that undercurrent of bad. I mean, at one point, and maybe it's even still being taught somewhere, white people taught their children that enslaving black people was okay. We know it's not, now- but it does show how something so wrong can be accepted because \"It's how things are,\" or \"it's tradition.\" The same can happen with politics. Some families are very political and teach their children that the only correct side is whichever party they are in. Then they grow up not really knowing anything else, and their perspective is so limited, they are incapable of seeing when things aren't right in their own party. They are conditioned to believe the government works perfectly and grow up to not question it, as long as the right party is in power. We have to break this conditioning if we don't want this country to crumble. This same thing can happen with relationships and all kinds of other things. People often repeat the behaviors of their parents unless they can break the cycle. Search for these things within yourself and work on them.

We did drive by birthday, drive way happy hours, canceled vacations, had toilet papers shortages and passed around hand sanitizer like never before. But we also learned to enjoy the slower pace and connect more with each other, had lots of outside play time and spent many evenings outside until the sun want down! \n\nThis school year will not look like anything we have seen before, as parents we have had to make the hardest decisions EVER about how are kids would return to school (assuming you were given a choice) But in the end we made the choice that was best for our individual families. \n\nI have seen the hard work the teaches and faculty have put into to make sure everyone is safe and that kids who are learning virtually can have as normal of a year as possible\u2014- for that THANK YOU! 🖤\n\nSo tonight as I go to bed I\u2019ll keep the teachers, the staff, the kids and parents in my prayers. \n\nI hope all students and teachers retuning today school tomorrow have a great day!

Long term effects so far have been majorly lung fibrosis, heart diseases, liver & brain damage.\n2. Patients who have a long ICU stay, who are critical and who have multiple co-morbidities are at a higher risk for developing C19 effects.\n3. Tocilizumab is known to cause lung damage like fibrosis that is seen in major complications\/long term effects. In a study in 2018, it caused heart & lung damage within one month of treatment, even leading to death.\n4. Remdesvir has been unproven for safety and it causes liver and kidney damage, causing acute kidney injury, even in otherwise healthy patients.\n5. Brain changes include paralysis or nervous changes are observed in only a handful of cases which are also not studied to know if they last long or go away.\n6. Vitamin D has been low in severe C19 patients. A daily\/weekly dose under a doctor's guidance should be supplied who do not have dietary or sun exposure.\n7. If patients are diagnosed and treated early, with appropriate conventional or traditional medicine, the side effects are almost nil and with lesser hospital stays.\n8. Most symptoms appear to eventually go away, it's just a matter of when, it may take longer for some patients: Dr Thomas who was involved in one of the largest C19 studies from the US.\n9. Fear only leads to a lowered immune system, making it incapable of fighting the disease.\nStay safe!\n~\nReference links in bio\n#covid #pandemic2020 #coronavirus #health #treatment #immunity #care #natural #prevention #heal #drugs #sideeffects #riskvsbenefit #earlydetection #cure","NumberOfLikes":59,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597575140,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 16 12:52:20 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Going out and shooting when I can. \n.\n.\n.\n#photograohy #blackandwhitephotography  #streetphotography #35mm #sony #sonyalpha #sonya7iii #kodaktrix400 #bostonglobe #bostonglobelife #bostondotcom #igboston #spi_collective #myspc #magnumphotos #lifeframer #streetsofboston #photooftheday #photojournalism #pandemic #covid_19 #pandemic2020 #wearamask #documentaryphotography #thespc","NumberOfLikes":40,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Nick Kairit on August 16, 2020 tagging @vicephoto, @igboston, @life_framer, @photographmag, @worldpressphoto, @streetleaks, @streetphotographyinternational, @bostonglobelife, @bostonstreetscollective, @streetphotographersfdn, and @streetphotographerscommunity_.

Scientists suspect that they contracted the virus by eating or touching an animal who was infected.\n_\nThis is yet another reason why we should all be #vegan.\n_\nIt's bad enough that the consumption of #meat and other animal-based foods contributes to #heartdisease, #diabetes and #cancer, and that harmful bacteria found in the intestines and faeces of #animals, including salmonella and E coli, often cause outbreaks of food poisoning. Do we really want to add more deadly animal-borne diseases into the mix?\n_\nMany devastating disease outbreaks come about because humans house animals in filthy, severely crowded farms and markets \u2013 breeding grounds for pathogens \u2013 in order to satisfy their meat habits.\n_\nIt's not at all unusual for viruses and other pathogens to jump from animals into the human population. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 75% of emerging infectious diseases originate in animals. Kevin Olival, a disease ecologist and conservationist at EcoHealth Alliance, says, \"When you bring animals together in \u2026 unnatural situations, you have the risk of human diseases emerging.\" In other words, many devastating disease outbreaks come about because humans house animals in filthy, severely crowded farms and markets \u2013 breeding grounds for pathogens \u2013 in order to satisfy their meat habit.\n_\n#rethink #govegan #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife #pandemic #covid19 #govegan #veganism #tryit #animallover #dogs #cats #puppy #kitten #veganfortheanimals\n#vegan #veganactivism #truth #backtoschool","NumberOfLikes":30,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":21,"Timestamp":1597537817,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 16 02:30:17 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#SocialDistancing Level 153: Negan.","NumberOfLikes":19,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Eric \"Buzz\" Kovac in The Compound with @thewalkingdead, @hardwick, @amcthewalkingdead, @amctalkingdead, @amc_tv, and @jeffreydeanmorgan.

In 2002, Florida set a clear limit on students per class: 22 students for elementary schools and 25 for high schools. \n\nImagine how much easier it has been introducing Social Distancing into their classrooms. Maybe this will be one of the positive movements that will be made coming out of the Pandemic but for now, all eyes are on the Learning From Home (LFH) Model for safety reasons but don\u2019t be fooled into thinking that this is good a long-term fix.\n \nWhen making this decision one must factor in the challenges of eLearning for both instructors and students that have been highlighted since 2015. While instructors need to put in intensive work and time to design the instruction, students face 5 common problems which need to be solved through proper initiatives for the students\u2019 to see the benefits:\n\n1. Adaptability Struggle\n2. Technical Issues\n3. Computer Literacy\n4. Time Management\n5. Self-Motivation\n \nWhile the LFH model is good news, it poses certain threats to students and simply cannot be the final answer. The District needs to work at thinking OUTSIDE THE BOX for something viable now. Then, work to accomodate small changes in the plan for the future.\n\n#coronavirus #business #businessgoals #grovetownga #covid19 #learningfromhome  #pandemic #pandemic2020 #strategies #pandemicstrategies #strategicrecovery #veteran #womanowned #covidrecovery #consultant #consulting #businessconsultant #business #georgia #continuity #elearning #businessconsulting #emergency #teachers #schooldistrict #educators #boardofeducation #elementary #highschool #middleschool #elementaryschool #boardofeducation","NumberOfLikes":4,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by CONSULTING | on August 15, 2020.
