Begitulah kira-kira kata orang-orang. Sejak kecil pun, mama sudah mewanti-wanti untuk selalu merawat rambut. Berbagai produk shampoo pun sudah pernah aku cobain, terlebih beberapa bulan ke belakang ini. Karena shampoo yang biasa aku pakai sejak zaman SMA, sudah nggak ampuh lagi untuk mengurangi kerontokan dan mengatasi rambut lepek. Sejak pandemic datang rambut aku yang biasanya tahan terhadap coloring berganti-ganti warna dan bleaching sampai kini ia pun rontok jua. Sampai akhirnya aku mencoba rangkaian produk shampoo dan treatment dari Moist Diane. \n@moistdianeid ⬅️\n\nAnyway, apakah ada yang sudah pernah mencoba Moist Diane Shampoo  dan Treatment? @moistdianeid . Produk asal Jepang yang diproduksi oleh NatureLab ini akhirnya resmi masuk ke Indonesia dan sudah mengantongi izin BPOM. Sehingga nggak perlu ragu lagi untuk beli produk ini.⬅️\n\nSementara brand ini sebenarnya sudah lebih dulu terkenal di luar negeri, seperti di Singapore, Hongkong, Malaysia, Thailand, Amerika, Korea Selatan, Vietnam, dan Amerika Serikat. Di negara asalnya, Jepang, Moist Diane Perfect Beauty Shampoo & Treatment sudah menjadi best seller. Dalam sepuluh hari saja, ada satu juta botol Moist Diane yang berhasil terjual. Nggak heran ya kenapa rambut cewek-cewek Jepang pada bagus-bagus.⬅️\n\nKlaim produk ini adalah tidak mengandung silikon, sulfat, dan paraben. Moist Diane hanya menggunakan bahan-bahan alami yang aman untuk rambut. Beauty keratin yang digunakan untuk memperbaiki struktur rambut pada produk Moist Diane juga termasuk shampoo aman untuk teman-teman muslim.⬅️\n\nKalian bisa kirim pesan ke admin instagramnya di @moistdianeid untuk tanya-tanya mengenai ketersediaan stock produk atau sekedar konsultasi mengenai permasalahan rambut kalian. Biar nggak salah pilih varian juga.⬅️\n\n#moist #diane #moistdiane #shampoo #shampo #premium #shampoopremium #shampooandconditioner #shampooantirontok #viralshampoo #hairshampoo #dailyshampoo #dailyshampooandconditioner #shampoomoistdiane #shampoomoisturizing #shampoomoistdianeantilepek #covid19 #pandemic #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife #coronavirus #corona #newnormal #newnormal2020","NumberOfLikes":85,"Hashtags":["#moist","#diane","#moistdiane","#shampoo","#shampo","#premium","#shampoopremium","#shampooandconditioner","#shampooantirontok","#viralshampoo","#hairshampoo","#dailyshampoo","#dailyshampooandconditioner","#shampoomoistdiane","#shampoomoisturizing","#shampoomoistdianeantilepek","#covid19","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#pandemiclife","#coronavirus","#corona","#newnormal","#newnormal2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1597503336,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 16:55:36 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"aakankshakri9","CaptionText":"ℍ𝕒𝕡𝕡𝕪😊 𝕚𝕟𝕕𝕖𝕡𝕖𝕟𝕕𝕖𝕟𝕔𝕖 𝕕𝕒𝕪 𝕥𝕠 𝕒𝕝𝕝 𝕠𝕗 𝕪𝕠𝕦 𝙡𝙤𝙘𝙠𝙙𝙤𝙬𝙣 𝙬𝙖𝙡𝙖 😅\n#happyindependenceday #pandemic2020 #lockdown \n#lockdowninindia #indianvlogger #instagram #indianyoutubers #Aakanksha #15august","NumberOfLikes":8,"Hashtags":["#happyindependenceday","#pandemic2020","#lockdown","#lockdowninindia","#indianvlogger","#instagram","#indianyoutubers","#Aakanksha","#15august"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Princess Aakanksha on August 15, 2020 tagging @aakankshakri9.

Never in a million years did I think getting a mask 😷, and checking daily temp would be part of the back to school list. This year has left me scratching my head on many occasions. The school Bailey goes to handled it very well. There was so much excitement on property! The teachers were genuinely excited to see all the kids. They made it a very special time for kids and parents. They helped lighten the load of the \u201Cshock factor\u201D of showing up to school with everyone in masks and all the different precautions in place. I am grateful that they chose to open her school. \n\nI also continue to be amazed watching my friends who are homeschooling their children. Talk about rising to the occasion and making the best of it. I have seen makeshift home classrooms(super cool by the way), activity centers, daily schedules, and most of all I\u2019ve seen parents connecting with other parents. I know these parents are being hard on themselves and going a little crazy, but please know you are doing AMAZING!! I have so much respect and admiration for you. \n\nOn a side note my heart is full seeing just how capable each of us are. It amazes me to see how we can adapt in hopes of making a better future for our children. While we may not agree with everything, for me personally I don\u2019t agree with a lot, but it\u2019s important that we continue to do and be our best for our kids and our future. Even if there are things that seem out of our control, what we choose to do within our own home could be what makes a lasting difference. There are so many of you that I\u2019ve connected with during this crazy time. I am so grateful for the connection and friendships that have come from this. I hope y\u2019all have a great weekend! \n\n#blogger #nashvilleblogger #vlogger #nashvillevlogger #backtoschool #backtoschool2020 #homeschool #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife #riseuptogether #riseabove #future #school #saturdaymood #family #friends #familyofinstagram #2020","NumberOfLikes":310,"Hashtags":["#blogger","#nashvilleblogger","#vlogger","#nashvillevlogger","#backtoschool","#backtoschool2020","#homeschool","#pandemic2020","#pandemiclife","#riseuptogether","#riseabove","#future","#school","#saturdaymood","#family","#friends","#familyofinstagram","#2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":13,"Timestamp":1597501463,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 16:24:23 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"eztransportsservices","CaptionText":"Different sizes dispensers available..\n\n1 246 831 1061 or 1 246 546 4707 \n\n#pandemic2020 #covid19 #sanitizer #clean","NumberOfLikes":1,"Hashtags":["#pandemic2020","#covid19","#sanitizer","#clean"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597501440,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 16:24:00 CEST 2020","Location":"Christ Church, Barbados"},{"Owner":"wildwoodlanding","CaptionText":"They did NOT stay 6 feet apart!\n.\n.\n.\n#wildwoodlanding\n#jg2hi \n#americasmartatl \n#atlantamarket \n#pandemic2020 \n#onesie \n#socialdistancing","NumberOfLikes":24,"Hashtags":["#wildwoodlanding","#jg2hi","#americasmartatl","#atlantamarket","#pandemic2020","#onesie","#socialdistancing"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":8,"Timestamp":1597500888,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 16:14:48 CEST 2020","Location":"AmericasMart Atlanta"},{"Owner":"kya_aadmi_hai","CaptionText":"Throwback to Ananya Birla Live India Tour in Ahmedabad. \nMiss these gigs\nHope we get back soon.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#ananayabirla#india#ahemdabad#ananyabirlalive#concert#concertphotography#concertphotographer #shotoncanon#eos #canonphotography #canonedge #dogreatwithcanon #music #clublife #livemusic #pandemic2020 #instagramdaily #artistphotography #artistphotographer #gujurat #isntaartist","NumberOfLikes":60,"Hashtags":["#ananayabirl","#indi","#ahemdaba","#ananyabirlaliv","#concer","#concertphotograph","#concertphotographer","#shotoncano","#eos","#canonphotography","#canonedge","#dogreatwithcanon","#music","#clublife","#livemusic","#pandemic2020","#instagramdaily","#artistphotography","#artistphotographer","#gujurat","#isntaartist"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597500850,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 16:14:10 CEST 2020","Location":"Ahmedabad, India"},{"Owner":"lisa80ig","CaptionText":"Can someone please help me make sense of this?

Previously I read an anthology of poetry and loved it. This is an anthology of letters and I knew I had to make it mine as soon as I lay eyes on it. It's beautiful to say the least.\n\n#bookreview👇\n\n\"You never came to stay; you never left to return. I never loved to un-love you, and that is the tragedy of my ordinary life.\"\n\n'With Love' is a collection of letters, each very deep and special in its own way. There's a longing for lost love and friendship. There are letters that talk of estranged relationships, and others which speak of people who you felt the closest to not having enough time for you. And then, there are letters which are ambiguous and reading through them you can't figure out who's written them to whom unless you reach the very end. These letters make you raise some very important questions, questions which you try answering but can't. \n\nThere were letters which made me smile, others which made me cry, a few which reminded me of people who have been a part of my life in the past and others that I have loved. There were a few that made me keep the book down and made me sympathise with people who have lived through tragedies. There are letters that talk about ends and others about beginnings. Some about heartbreaks, others about hope. Some about love and others about fear. \n\nA letter made me raise a very important question which was- How do you decide it's time to leave a friendship, a relationship, even a marriage?\nThere was one letter in particular which made me realise how we often contemplate things and don't do them and regret it later. And one made me think how we feel stupid for our actions when in reality all they are is cute. \n\nAll in all this anthology of letters was full of realisations for me. It evoked feelings that I didn't know existed within me. It brought about a flurry of emotions and I was forced to sit back and reflect and give myself closure on things that lie there hanging. It was a book which proved helpful to me in a way no one ever has.\n\nRead it to feel things. Read it to reminisce a beautiful past and be assured that a great future lies ahead.","NumberOfLikes":341,"Hashtags":["#qotd-","#bookreview👇"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by JAPNEET\u2022BOOKSTAGRAM\u2022IN 🇮🇳 in Delhi, India with @booknerdparadise, @booksparks, @penguinindia, @ttt_official, @penguinbooks, @flatlay_gallery, @flatlay, @theb00kstagram, @flatlayindia, @ig.reads, @igreadsindia, @mybookfeatures, @midlandbooksofficial, @bookishladiesclub, @flatlaysquad, @bookishfeatures_, @perksofbookstagram, @bookreviewfeatures, and @flatlayphotographers.","NumberOfComments":57,"Timestamp":1597491616,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 13:40:16 CEST 2020","Location":"Delhi, India"},{"Owner":"mark_lovedamn","CaptionText":"Border closure, magazine collage #collage #magazinecollage #coffin #coffinmaker #kolajmagazine #landscapecollage #modernart #modernartist #isolationism #socialdistanceart #stayhome #socialdistancing #seanscully #johnnixon #hotspots #covidcluster #townhallgallery#secondwave #stagefour #nswborder #pandemic #pandemic2020 #dumptrump","NumberOfLikes":58,"Hashtags":["#collage","#magazinecollage","#coffin","#coffinmaker","#kolajmagazine","#landscapecollage","#modernart","#modernartist","#isolationism","#socialdistanceart","#stayhome","#socialdistancing","#seanscully","#johnnixon","#hotspots","#covidcluster","#townhallgaller","#secondwave","#stagefour","#nswborder","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#dumptrump"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Mark Loveday on August 15, 2020.","NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597491472,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 13:37:52 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"pradanabayu90","CaptionText":"event peduli covid-19 robert pantau, event amal yg donasinya terkumpul ratusan jt untuk membantu saudara\" kita, luar biasa & salut untuk semua panitia penyelenggara.\n#robertpantau #bnr #indonesia #merahputih #covid_19 #pandemic2020 #magelanghits","NumberOfLikes":29,"Hashtags":["#robertpantau","#bnr","#indonesia","#merahputih","#covid_19","#pandemic2020","#magelanghits"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Bayu Pradana in Stadion Moch Soebroto Kota Magelang.

They won't take much time, unless you want them to. \n.\nYou're welcome to participate as often as you like, or just encourage the day's participants and have a laugh and respite from the stresses of 2020. The only rules will be:\n.\n1. No nasty, degrading or otherwise negative comments\n2.

Desperté más temprano de lo normal para hacer unos pendientes antes de mi rutina de ejercicio. Baje hacerla para después tomar mi café y subir a bañarme, Zoe despertó cuando me estaba peinando, la deje tomando su leche en lo que terminaba de peinar, regrese para alistarla y bajar hacer el desayuno. Después de desayunar, el papi terminó una junta de trabajo y nos fuimos a una playita a la que no habíamos ido a desconectarnos un poco de todo. Nos gusto mucho, cuando llegamos no había mucha gente y el lugar está bastante amplio, así que no teníamos a nadie al rededor, más tarde comenzó a llegar más gente pero por la siesta de Zoe nos teníamos que ir. Zoe disfruto mucho jugando en el agua con su papi, y yo disfruté verlos felices y jugando. Cuando regresamos a casa llegamos muy cansado, así que todos nos subimos a dormir, al despertar bajamos a comer\/cenar, y Zoe comenzó a preguntar por Kuko, así que le pregunte a su mamá si iban a salir, no le dije dos veces a Zoe que Kuko ya estaba en camino cuando fue a ponerse sus sandalias para salir. Hoy jugó solo un ratito con el, ya que tenía que regresar a casa temprano y ella tenía que bañarse. Después de un buen baño se tomó su leche para después dormir.\n\n#zoedemicorazon🐥 #recolectandomomentos #staysafeathome #fighting👑🦠 #motherhoodincovid19 #SocialDistancing #FlattentheCurve #stayhomechallenge #stayhomesafelifes #pandemic2020 #quaranteam","NumberOfLikes":9,"Hashtags":["#zoedemicorazon🐥","#recolectandomomentos","#staysafeathome","#fighting👑🦠","#motherhoodincovid19","#SocialDistancing","#FlattentheCurve","#stayhomechallenge","#stayhomesafelifes","#pandemic2020","#quaranteam"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1597463060,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 05:44:20 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"mumtazsabila_tour","CaptionText":"Semoga pandemi segera berlalu dan bisa kembali ke tanah suci \n. . . . . . . \nMonggo daftar sebelum kuota full\n____________________________________\n#umrah2020 #umrahhemat #umrahkelaurga #pandemic2020 #pandemic #umrahbarokah #umrahpromo","NumberOfLikes":7,"Hashtags":["#umrah2020","#umrahhemat","#umrahkelaurga","#pandemic2020","#pandemic","#umrahbarokah","#umrahpromo"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by PT.

As such, this year marks the 74th Independence Day of the country. While it is a celebratory annual occasion and a national holiday, wherein people hoist the national flag, wear colours signifying the tricolour, take part in many games and cultural programmes, it also coincides with the Partition of the country that brings back painful memories, given that India was severed on communal grounds, much to the dismay of many national leaders and ordinary citizens.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n#indepedanceday \n#india #15august #proud #prosperity #patriotic #maatujhesalaam #vandematram #proudindian #iloveindia🇮🇳 #indianarmy #realheroes #doctors #coronafighters #servecountry #greetingcards #videocreator #videoediting #videoedits #graphicdesign #motivationoftheday #instadaily #instavideo #pmodigital #digitalindia #internetwishes #stayhome #staysafe #covid_19 #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":17,"Hashtags":["#indepedanceday","#india","#15august","#proud","#prosperity","#patriotic","#maatujhesalaam","#vandematram","#proudindian","#iloveindia🇮🇳","#indianarmy","#realheroes","#doctors","#coronafighters","#servecountry","#greetingcards","#videocreator","#videoediting","#videoedits","#graphicdesign","#motivationoftheday","#instadaily","#instavideo","#pmodigital","#digitalindia","#internetwishes","#stayhome","#staysafe","#covid_19","#pandemic2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597450793,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 02:19:53 CEST 2020","Location":"India"},{"Owner":"thatcabinfamily","CaptionText":"For someone who was crying last night and this morning because she didn't feel good she definitely has some energy now.

Those suggestions include making coronavirus tests broadly accessible, and free. He has said there should be no out-of-pocket cost for patients to receive an eventual vaccine, either. And he has been sharply critical of President Trump\u2019s response to the virus, accusing him of reacting too slowly.\n\nMr. Biden served as vice president in the Obama administration during the passage of the Affordable Care Act, and health care remains a top priority for him. It\u2019s an issue he often discusses in the context of his family\u2019s personal tragedies: He lost his first wife and an infant daughter in a car accident in 1972, and in 2015, his son Beau Biden died of brain cancer. Health care, he said in an early television ad, is \u201Cpersonal\u201D to him. He supports adding a public option to the Affordable Care Act, but opposes \u201CMedicare for all,\u201D the sweeping single-payer measure advocated by some progressives in his party, including Senator Bernie Sanders.\n\nMr. Biden, who served for decades in the Senate, firmly believes in the value of bipartisanship and insists on extending overtures to Republicans even in a moment when many in his own party don\u2019t see negotiating partners on the other side. As a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he also speaks passionately about asserting and defending America\u2019s role as a leader on the global stage.\n\nSource: @nytimes #NYtimes\n#Connecticut #CT #PrimaryElection #August2020 #GeneralElection #November2020 #Democrat #Democrats #DemocraticParty #CTdems #JoeBiden #KamalaHarris #WhiteHouse #Politics #UnitedStates #Election2020 #ElectionDay #Vote #Vote2020 #CTvote2020 #RegisterToVote #VoteByMail #2020 #AbsenteeBallot #BLM #BlackLivesMatter #COVID19 #Coronavirus #Pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":15,"Hashtags":["#NYtimes","#Connecticut","#CT","#PrimaryElection","#August2020","#GeneralElection","#November2020","#Democrat","#Democrats","#DemocraticParty","#CTdems","#JoeBiden","#KamalaHarris","#WhiteHouse","#Politics","#UnitedStates","#Election2020","#ElectionDay","#Vote","#Vote2020","#CTvote2020","#RegisterToVote","#VoteByMail","#2020","#AbsenteeBallot","#BLM","#BlackLivesMatter","#COVID19","#Coronavirus","#Pandemic2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by CT Vote 2020 in East Hartford, Connecticut.

As schools get ready to re-open in September after a long quarantine break, this has been a very difficult time and a confusing decision to make for parents. \n\nI met my neighbor yesterday and she asked me what I was planning to do. When I told her, she felt so re-assured that she had someone who had decided the same as her. \n\nI think in these confusing times, every parent wants that support and re-assurance about the decision that they have made. But everyone cannot have the same decision. Everyone has different age kids, different work circumstances and different set of issues leading upto that decision. While, it\u2019s an ongoing decision about what\u2019s the right thing to do, I don\u2019t think there is one right answer for anyone and I want to tell all parents that whatever decision you have taken today, it\u2019s the right one for you and your family and you have done the right thing for your kids and they will be okay as long as you support them throughout this phase whether they are at home or at school 😊\n\nAs for me, my kids will be going back to school in September and the most important part in this decision was taking the kids opinions in consideration and they both are very comfortable with the idea of going back to school 💖\n\nIf anyone is having a hard time thinking about this confusion situation you can always dm me.

Happy Seller! .\n.\n.\nA little late in posting this, but please pause for a sec to help me congratulate the Stolarski family. [See previous post too].\n. \n. \nThis couple deserve a parents of the year award for making a move during a pandemic! .\n. \n. \nHere\u2019s the brief synopsis: 9 years ago we helped Josh and Victoria when they were newlyweds buy their first home. In the meantime, their family grew. They had 3 kids and decided to make a move to a larger more spacious home in 2020. Their careers were expanding and all was looking bright. .\n. \n. \nWe were delighted at the beginning of this year to hear from them asking for our help again! We were happy to give them staging advice and set them on the path to sell and buy. We had gotten partial photos of the house as the house preparations were underway. We were getting them ready to list and to home shop. Then, BAM! A pandemic hit... A quarantine happened. .\n. \n. \nWhat a roller coaster ride to get from point A to point B. Listing virtually. Showing virtually. Home shopping virtually. What a stressful experience for the kids. .\n. \n. \nEven once everything was under contract, then getting it closed safely and smoothly was not easy. We are grateful everything came together. And this beautiful family is now happily settled into their new home! .\n. \n. \nPlease take a moment to help me congratulate them! They deserve a medal! ☺️🙌🏼🏡 .\n. \n. \n\n#youarehome #statecollege #bellefonte #realestate #nyssasmithandco #kellerwilliams #advantage #realty #realtorlife #quarantinelife #pandemic2020 #SOLD","NumberOfLikes":30,"Hashtags":["#youarehome","#statecollege","#bellefonte","#realestate","#nyssasmithandco","#kellerwilliams","#advantage","#realty","#realtorlife","#quarantinelife","#pandemic2020","#SOLD"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Nyssa Smith 🙋🏼\u200D♀️🌸👜 on August 14, 2020.

Link da Vaquinha na Bio\n.\nA solidariedade em meio a uma pandemia é a melhor forma de ajudar as famílias das comunidades carentes de Palmito e Bico da Pedra, situadas cerca de 15 km do centro do município de Montes Claros, MG. O acesso se dá, majoritariamente, por uma estrada municipal de terra em condições precárias. As comunidades enfrentam sérios problemas de abastecimento de água, atrelado a isso, temos também casos de famílias que precisam viver sem energia elétrica, uma vez que a rede elétrica não contempla aquelas que moram mais distantes do \u201Ccentro das comunidades\u201D.\nAtualmente os moradores também passam por sérias dificuldades econômicas. A renda da maioria das famílias, devido à proximidade da comunidade com a cidade de Montes Claros, se dá por empregos formais e informais. Porém, devido a pandemia do novo corona vírus muitos empregados foram demitidos e as famílias ficaram à mercê do auxílio emergencial ou da ajuda de associações de voluntários.\n.\nNesse sentido, nosso objetivo é arrecadar um montante total de 2.000,00 (dois mil reais) que serão convertidos na compra e distribuição de cestas básicas para os moradores de Palmito e Bico da Pedra. A sua doação é muito importante para estas famílias carentes e que, além de todos os problemas ambientas e sociais, agora ainda enfrentam grandes dificuldades econômicas.\n.\nAgradecemos a todos pelo apoio e a sua colaboração!!\n\n#solidariedadesempre #montesclaros #montesclarosmg #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":26,"Hashtags":["#solidariedadesempre","#montesclaros","#montesclarosmg","#pandemic2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ESF Núcleo Montes Claros 🌎 on August 14, 2020.

The idea is to NOTICE, to OBSERVE, to CONNECT to yourself. \n\nTHAT is the gift of slowing down. It gives us space to know what\u2019s going inside so we can become more aware. In turn, our increased awareness can help us make choices that align with how we want to feel and live. It\u2019s how we take responsibility for our lives. It\u2019s how we can create a life that feels good inside and out. \n\nSo, although many challenges have risen, which we are still are facing, I hope we, as an entire nation, continue to see the value in slowing down! May we continue to be creative and find ways to do so even after this crisis is over. Like any experience, feel what needs to be felt, release what no longer serves you and bring with you the lessons to move forward mindfully. \n\nHow does that sound?

Rates of suicide, domestic violence and all forms of abuse have risen astronomically. If you\u2019re blessed to have a job, security and happiness at this time - remember that the majority, are not as fortunate as you. \n\nI count my blessings, I practise gratitude - but I\u2019m prone to triggers. Lockdown makes me feel trapped and isolated, which evokes sadness & anxieties. Outdoor walks are helping me get through the days and I need only reach out - to realise, I am not alone.\n\nWe are truly in this together, I frequently FaceTime my family in the UK, my sis-in-law my girlfriends and my Uni mates, and we\u2019re all over it & feeling the same... There are common emotions & triggers we are all experiencing.\n\nI\u2019ve been so happy to notice alot of people creating music, painting & channeling their inner child whilst all this is going on. I think it\u2019s really beautiful & therapeutic - in a way, we are healing. This is a time of self-reflection and as I say often, healing often means falling first to learn later.\n\nBe kind, to yourself & those around you, try not to do things that harm you. Be accountable, open up to those you trust, splurge on things that are good for you. Before you fire up, attempt to understand where your fear is coming from. Communicate honestly, choose vulnerability instead... you\u2019d be surprised how many people can relate.\n\nRegardless of your view on the situation. Don\u2019t cut yourself off, If you\u2019re feeling depression, anxiety, fear or anger; know that you\u2019re not alone. Reach out to your tribe, it\u2019s more important than ever, that we\u2019re here to support one another. ♥️\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#lockdown  #covid19 #saveourchildren  #corona #pandemic2020  #viclockdown  #domesticviolence  #abuse #healing  #therapy  #heal  #pandemic  #covid  #bloggers  #photography  #typography  #wordsmith  #middleeasternmusic  #shortpoetry #thelatestquote  #goodvibes  #lifequotes  #love  #poetrycommunity  #poem  #poet  #poems  #quotes  #writer","NumberOfLikes":41,"Hashtags":["#lockdown","#covid19","#saveourchildren","#corona","#pandemic2020","#viclockdown","#domesticviolence","#abuse","#healing","#therapy","#heal","#pandemic","#covid","#bloggers","#photography","#typography","#wordsmith","#middleeasternmusic","#shortpoetry","#thelatestquote","#goodvibes","#lifequotes","#love","#poetrycommunity","#poem","#poet","#poems","#quotes","#writer"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ልꪑ\u200Bꫀ\u200Bꫀ\u200B𝘳\u200Bꪖ 🇦🇺🇬🇧🇮🇪🇦🇪 in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

I was excited to see the clouds and light return as it\u2019s been a few weeks since we\u2019ve had good clouds and light. Today is day #150 since we\u2019ve started sheltering in place. I\u2019ve been missing a lot of sunsets because every night at 8, our neighborhood puts on a concert. We started on Easter Sunday and have now played 117 concerts with only a few missed days here and there. We started off howling to thank frontline workers and it\u2019s evolved to multi-instrument concerts. There are some days where I\u2019m so busy with work and keeping the kids busy (or from killing each other) that it\u2019s the only time I get to step outside. I play the flute, my son plays the trumpet\/piano, my other son the piano\/ukulele, and my husband occasionally plays the piano as well.  We have neighbors who play the trombone, guitar, ukulele and mandolin.  In those 117 days, we\u2019ve celebrated a graduation, numerous birthdays and even bid farewell to a neighbor who moved after living in the neighborhood for 28 years. Despite being in the neighborhood for 14 years, we\u2019ve gotten to really bond with everyone and get to know them better. As much as I love a good sunset, the tradeoff has definitely been worth it. After 117 days, we\u2019re always looking for new songs to play. If you have any suggestions, please write it in the comments.  How have you all been and what have you been doing during this unique time?

Hoy desperté pensando que ya era viernes, pero mi realidad volvió cuando vi la fecha en la pantalla del celular, pero no fue motivo para que me quedara en la cama, si sino la alarma fue por que es día de levantarse temprano hacer ejercicio. Así que me levante para bajar hacer mi rutina, al terminar me estaba tomando mi café cuando Zoe despertó y desde la noche me dijo que iba hacer ejercicio conmigo, así que le puse su \u201Cropa deportiva\u201D para hacer 3 minutos de ejercicio y después meternos a bañar. El papi me ayudó a cambiarla para que yo terminara de alistarme y no tardar más en cajas hacer el desayuno, bajamos y Zoe quiso hacer su huevo verde, así que desayuno huevo verde. Después salimos un rato a jugar en el jardín para regresar a que durmiera la siesta. En cuánto quedó dormida me fui al súper a compra fruta y verdura para la semana, cuando regrese Zoe ya había despertado e iba bajando con el papi, bajo con el a su cueva en lo que yo sacaba más cosas de la comida. Luego subieron a que comiéramos para ir por Kuko y sus papis en la camioneta e ir al parque a jugar. En casi 5 meses fue la primera vez que Zoe regresó a un parque, a pesar de ver el área de juegos, sabía que no podía ir y que solo habíamos ido a correr con Kuko en el pasto. Como todo niño, obvio pidió ir al área de juegos, pero le volví a contar la historia del bichito y entendió, y cuando comenzó a correr con Kuko se le olvidó que había juegos y otros niños en ellos. Estuvimos hasta que comenzó a obscurecer y regresamos al carro para retornar a casa haciendo primero parada en casa de Kuko.

Everyone\u2019s worlds have been turned upside down. Some are able to handle that better than others. Some are dealing with heightened anxiety, stress, and\/or depression for various reasons and each of these things look different for everyone.\n\nAs someone who has anxiety and mild depression, this pandemic pushed me over the edge due to everything going on in the world combined with other stressful moments in my life that I\u2019d like to keep private out of respect for who those moments involve. I never had extreme physical anxiety symptoms until this year. I truly had no idea what was happening at first. I sought medical care multiple times and each time was told I was fine (thank God!). But the symptoms persisted. I was also losing more sleep than usual and having more mental breakdowns than usual. I noticed myself withdrawing from certain friends\/family and doing the complete opposite to other friends\/family. Basically, it got to the point where I finally decided to see a counselor specialized in anxiety. I put off seeing one for years but after my first meeting, I felt silly as to why I waited so long.\n\nNone of this might seem major to you. Or you may resonate with me. Either way, I hope you understand the importance of making mental health a priority and making YOURSELF a priority. I know it\u2019s easier said than done but don\u2019t be afraid to seek the help you need.\n\nI\u2019m sharing this with you all because I like to be fully transparent. As a blogger who chooses to share many moments of joy and lots of light hearted content like makeup, food, lifestyle, etc, I choose to share the raw and real moments as well. We\u2019re all human.

At the same time, many are falling ill with #COVID_19 while also enduring the largest wage losses amid the pandemic-triggered recession. In San Joaquin and other rural counties, these workers often live in spaces not meant for human habitation. They are scared that their immigration status will be used against them if they don\u2019t comply with landlords, and they have little access to either legal advice or government aid. Federal relief funds that sent $1,200 #stimulus payments to Americans excluded most of these families. The state\u2019s Judicial Council is expected Thursday to extend its eviction ban until the end of the month, preventing court-sanctioned ousters, but such safeguards are not honored in this shadow market.

And grateful for the people who have been able to step up when I needed them. \n\n#vulnerability #reallife #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife #pandemicliving #covid19 #pandemicsucks #pandemicschooling #pandemicsuccess #pandemicschangeeverything","NumberOfLikes":16,"Hashtags":["#vulnerability","#reallife","#pandemic2020","#pandemiclife","#pandemicliving","#covid19","#pandemicsucks","#pandemicschooling","#pandemicsuccess","#pandemicschangeeverything"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Quinn on August 13, 2020.

Both are true at the same time.\u2063\n\u2063\nFor those that are parents, the difficult job of parenting is further complicated this year due to the pandemic, no matter what your individual situation.\u2063\n\u2063\nDr. Kristin Neff writes about Self-Compassion, and it is one of the most grounding things I believe we can apply to parenting.\u2063\n\u2063\nShe describes self-compassion like this:\u2063\n\"Instead of mercilessly judging and criticizing yourself for various inadequacies or shortcomings, self-compassion means you are kind and understanding when confronted with personal failings \u2013 after all, who ever said you were supposed to be perfect?\"\u2063\n\u2063\nThe 3 ingredients necessary (according to Neff, summarized by me) for self-compassion are:\u2063\n\u2063\n1. Self-kindness vs. Self-judgment:\u2063\nWe are warm and understanding to ourselves when we suffer, fail or feel inadequate, instead of beating ourselves up internally.\u2063\n\u2063\n2. Common humanity vs. Isolation:\u2063\nKnowing you are not the only one...recognizing that suffering and personal inadequacy are a part of all of our human experience.\u2063\n\u2063\n3. Mindfulness vs. Over-identification:\u2063\nThe balance of naming how you feel with compassion, without stuffing it, or without being swept away by it. \u2063\n\u2063\nThese 3 ingredients applied to parenting could look like:\u2063\nI am not parenting my child today in the way that I want to. I am having a hard time being as present or as patient as I want to be today. I notice that I am so tired. And I know I am not the only parent struggling with this right now. Even though I want to do better, beating myself up about it will not help. I need some tenderness, some rest, and the understanding that I can start over at any moment, even now.\u2063\n\u2063\nCheering on all parents today❤️.","NumberOfLikes":110,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Monica DiCristina, LPC on August 13, 2020.

Secluded from the Eid I am used to, I suppose this isn't new as we have barely participated in any since her departure. Her death. Eight years worth. For anything familial I'm usually the glue in between the cracks that remain this was the year that I couldn't physically do it, be the Amma (Mother) 'gap filler' as it were. I couldn't be there attempting to create the aromas in the kitchen in homage to her. Calling everyone to the table a gazillion times before resorting to \"I'm eating without you all!\" Loading up everybody's plates, until no actual plate remains. You know, \"mum stuff\" - but I also know that some of you may not know. That is a grief that I do not bear. The guilt was a lot for the first Eid in isolation, by the second it simmered. What I could do was wear her shari (her clothing) without the feel of shame in doing so, for the fear of causing upset. Albeit it was secretly away done from the family. The first Eid I didn't get changed until gone 8pm as I spent the day \"should I, shouldn't I?\" I'm glad I did! it made all the difference. The feel of her shari. Even though they are washed, her scent remains - or it may just be a psychological hold that I have created. Whichever it is, I'll welcome it. The Eid that followed a few months later, getting changed was the first thing I did. Still in isolation, but there was an Eid treasure hunt with the duo and a mouthwatering version of juicy yet crunchy fried chicken. And so, a tradition was born \nEFC - Eid Fried Chicken \ncourtesy of 🧔🏻 this was our new kind of Eid.
