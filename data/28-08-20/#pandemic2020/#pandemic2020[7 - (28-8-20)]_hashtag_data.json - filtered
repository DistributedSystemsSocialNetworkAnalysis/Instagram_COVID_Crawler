If you haven\u2019t been keeping up with my situation here in New York City, then let me briefly tell you. So, back in march I lost my job because of the pandemic. That was really tough because I was self-employed. I spent two months trying to get my PUA (pandemic unemployment benefits) while temporarily on SNAP (welfare) because I lost my job. That was a pain, but I finally got my PUA, thank God. After that I researched and applied to a bunch of companies online. Many declined me and only two accepted my application. I chose to go with the company that I liked better. So then I got my first interview. The first interview was by phone. After that, I was asked to get interviewed again but face-to-face in a virtual setting. I did that and was told that I\u2019ll get feedback in a day or two. When I didn\u2019t hear back from my recruiter after two days, I sent her a follow up email asking about the postion. Later the next day she got back to me, said sorry for the delay and was waiting for more information from the hiring team. She then said that she\u2019d call me later on today. So, I waited and waited while praying to God that I get the job, because I really like it and need it! Then around 3:30PM my recruiter called me and said I\u2019ve got the job!!! SubhanAllah! Glory be to God! Alhamdulillah! I thanked God and then told my recruiter how happy I was to have been hired!!! So, after many months of worrying about how I was going to provide for my family and I, and after a lot of prayers and trust in the Creator, He has made a way for me. Alhamdulillah, praise be to God. \nFor those of you who have been with me through this crazy time, thank you. I really appreciate your kind words, encouragement and support. If you haven\u2019t followed me on my account @lionbeardkhannyc then I invite you to do so. I\u2019m still doing NYC walking videos, showing you around New York City. I still plan on writing\/journaling what\u2019s going on here and with my situation. The only addition is that I post videos and goofy things here and there, and share with you more about myself. Again, thank you and thank you for reading!... A new chapter awaits and the journey continues. üï∂ - Khan","NumberOfLikes":5,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Lion Beard Khan | NYC in New York City, N.Y..

Its sidekicks are doubt, fear, numbness, avoidance, and anger. They bust through the front door of your mental, physical, and spiritual home armed to strip you from the world you once believed was safe, predictable, and manageable. Trauma can be a ruthless thief, entering quickly and violently, taking whatever it desires. Or, it can be a robber that surveils; takes one thing at a time when you are not looking, and it is not until later that you finally notice that your most prized possessions; your relationships, sleep, emotional control, energy, appetite, thoughts, concentration, and joy have all been stolen. Where there is trauma, there is always loss \u201C\n\nIs there something you would like me to write about in my next article or blog?  I\u2019d love to hear your ideas!

We have shared a good number of happy as well as sad moments together. As we started growing up, we got closer and closer. We both felt incomplete if we couldn't share anything which was going on in our lives back then. If any of us forgot to tell each other something which some other friend already knew, we used to get angry and wouldn't talk with each other for days. In the midst of everything, we didn't realize that we had actually \"fallen for each other. \"\nAnd it was on 12.08.2010, (we were in 10th grade) we officially got into a relationship. Back then it was a hush-hush affair and we tried our best to hide it from everyone. Except for a few close friends (who actually used to save us during troubles), we didn't tell anyone. It was mostly the teenage kind of love and we were drooling in a fairy-tale land. \nWe used to fight a lot, decided to end our relationship forever and then again, came back to each other. We became inevitable for each other. \nGradually we entered adulthood, our maturity level changed, our aims in life changed but amidst all the changes, our feelings for each other remained the same. Day by day we realized that love is not just about holding hands and clicking pictures, it's all about commitments and being there for each other under all tough situations. We do have our period of ups and down, be it personal or professional. There are times we feel claustrophobic dealing with day to day life. But then, one of us will always be there for the other person to motivate and cheer up. Now our love has turned us into each other's support system. Many people ask that how we are staying in the same relationship for so many years. Honestly speaking, we don't know the answer. It's just that we can't think of a life without each other. We fight even now yet we  never feel like giving up. We don't know what's there for us in the future. We don't claim to be the perfect couple too. With blessings from both of our families, we are trying to build a simple yet happy life. \n#love #truelove #beingthereforeachother #decade #gharbandi #pandemic2020 #gocorona #positivevibes #lovestory  #relationshipgoals","NumberOfLikes":22,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597239270,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 12 15:34:30 CEST 2020","Location":"Kolkata"},{"CaptionText":"Went to my dressing room yesterday.

And I saw two billboards on the NJ Turnpike for @wecomefromaway \nstill up and beaming so that made my heart soar. \n\nI miss working.

When they are about to cross the Red Sea and the Israelites can see Pharaoh\u2019s army coming for them and they are filled with fear. \u201CBut Moses told the people, \u201CDon\u2019t be afraid. Just stand still and watch the Lord rescue you today...The Lord himself will fight for you. Just stay calm.\u201D\u2014Exodus 14:13-14\n‚ú®\nAs we go through the rollercoaster that is 2020 these words feel as relevant today as they were thousands of years ago when Moses spoke them. The Lord WILL fight for you. He IS fighting for you already. All we have to do is ask.\n‚ú®\nI read an article this week about a survey recently conducted by the Pew Research Center that shows that 89% of Americans have turned to TV or movies to cope during the pandemic but only 3 out of every 10 US adults are reading the Bible at least weekly. More people are zoning out in front of the TV rather than turning to the Lord for help. So, I would like to encourage you to read your Bibles and spend time getting to know the Lord!

Kitchen, where all the magic was supposed to happen with all kinds of colorful raw stuff going in and delicious mouthwatering dishes and boiled stuff(for some) coming out, wasn\u2019t such a magical place after all. Learning that it takes hours to make something that was taken for granted has tremendously increased my appreciation for my mother.\nPS: I know how to cook Rajma chawal now.\n.\n.\n2.  Another thing I was taking and we all were taking granted for was Health. Yeah, that important thing everyone is taking care of nowadays, was on backseat when everyone was running around doing jobs, struggling with traffic jams, missing meals, eating junk food, has now come to the front seat of our attention. Reassessment of priorities has made us myself included more inclined towards staying fit.\n.\n.\n3. Somewhere, someplace we all read that Books are a person\u2019s best friend. But, when you have human besties around it was hard to care about books. Now that, when even Video Calls lost their charm after the first month, I turned towards the dusty collection of books that have been silently biding their time. All those sunsets and nights spent reading books have made me believe that indeed books are a person\u2019s best friend.\nUntil, the human ones come wearing the whole mask, gloves, and everything.\n.\n.\n4. Creation, amidst the chaos, is the only thing that\u2019s a silent and loud reply at the same time to all the uncertainty. Writing a poem, creating a bookmark out of paper, trying (and spectacularly failing) to make a paper rose, planting a little sapling of mint, folding tiny paper planes and boats, are the things that helped maintain sanity and a measure of peace throughout all the chaos going around.\nSometimes, you have to do things a bit more tenderness to realize that there is joy in simple things.\n\n( continued in comments )","NumberOfLikes":125,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":16,"Timestamp":1597150046,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 11 14:47:26 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"hi,  buat kamu yang mampir drop&pick sepatu silahkan gunakan maskermu dan selalu ikuti protokol Covid 19 ya frens. \nMari kita putus mata rantai covid ini dengan selalu waspada dan jaga jarak aman üòá\n.\n#sepatubersih #sepatu #sepatukamukotorshoesainaja #masker #covid19 #shoeswash #shoesüëü #washshoes #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":10,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Cuci sepatu di sumbar on August 11, 2020.

At least for me.\nFor the first time in the nearly 13 years we've been living in Ohio, last year we bought season passes while they were having the $99 deal good for this year.\nFast forward to now... Life definitely is a lot different than we thought (of course our luck ü§∑\u200D‚ôÄÔ∏è.)\nI'm grateful the passes will still be good for next year but on this day two weeks ago, my son & I went. We primarily wanted to go find our brick (spoiler alert: we didn't ü§£) but I also wanted to see for myself how it would be.\nI will give CP credit. They seemed to be doing the best they could with line spacing, hand sanitizer, & limiting rides.\nIt was the people not adhering to said precautions that made me feel uneasy. \nMaybe it was the day we went or just maybe I'm more observant than most but lots of folks had their masks pulled down & huddling up right next to others in line. It was honestly disappointing.\nIf everyone would be following protocol, it wouldn't be that bad to try to keep the summer activity of CP in the loop but unfortunately for this to work, we all need to work together.\nI also pay homage to it being exactly 2 weeks because just in case we had symptoms, we'd know it was from this day.. it's kind of sad to mentally keep track of what you did, where you were but that's just our new normal. \nAt least for now.\nI can now breathe easy knowing that we came out of 2 hours at @cedarpoint unscathed. üí™\n\n‚ú≥Ô∏è Can you relate?

One of the deadliest and most dangerous virus to be spread across the world. All of us have been locked up in our homes for more than a quarter now, with so many changes in our lifestyle, masks and sanitizers are now a necessity more than a choice and social distancing is for sure to be practiced under every circumstances. And here we stand trying to make the most of our lives amidst this chaos, learning new skills, making up for the forgotten relations, staying fit is up for a check and every household now breeds brand a new chef. Much lost and yet so much we gained. Turning round the corner, life is back on wheels with new precautions indeed.

And selfish was bad. And I didn\u2019t want to be bad, so I did my best to put others\u2019 preferences first.\n.\nConversely, I\u2019ve spent the last 48 hours quietly asking myself the question \u201CJen, what do YOU want right now?\u201D It\u2019s caught me off guard as a surprisingly adventurous and exciting question! ü§ó\n.\n\u201CWhat snack do YOU want at the gas station? What time do YOU want to get up in the morning? Rest day or lift day, what is YOUR body telling you, YOU need? What appetizer are YOU going to jump for joy over? Nap or pool? Hike or read?\u201D\n.\nIt feels remarkably odd, and it\u2019s ok... the  fact that I\u2019ve spent the majority of my life gladly (in these very small ways) asking others what they want first. Because if they\u2019re happy, THEN I can be happy. And there\u2019s some truth to that. Service and sacrifice are remarkable acts of love, which is why this practice of self-centerdness can be challenging to sift through. How do I balance self-love and love for others?! \n.\nNow, don\u2019t get me wrong. I am not a cheerleader for narcissists, or a fan of egomaniacs. Selfish, in this context can be bad. Very bad. Yet I know that these times have shown us one thing; we must take care of ourselves. And sometimes we must take care of ourselves FIRST.\n.\nHaving a newborn three times over taught me that. I literally couldn\u2019t feed my babes if I didn\u2019t rest, drink water and eat enough. I had to be first, to also put my daughters first.\n.\nHear this. When we are honest with what we want and need... and align with the brightest truth of who we are, we are personally most fulfilled. I also happen to believe we become a piece to this societal puzzle, that\u2019s necessary to progress us forward. And last but not least, the truth is, we are also a blessing to others. That is not selfish. It\u2019s beautiful and brave. Quietly (or loudly) ask yourself what YOU want (even if it\u2019s just occasionally). Show yo self some self love!

Kids, parents, teenagers, grandparents. Whether it be an economic impact or a social\/emotional impact. It\u2019s. Been. Tough. \n\nAnd we are ALL walking through this season of change and unknowns together. But I think we tend to forget that. \n\nSince the lockdown started I began cleaning my 94 year old grandmothers home because we didn\u2019t want someone else coming into her home that could potentially expose her to the virus. She also hasn\u2019t left the house much in order to protect herself. She\u2019s just been home except for a couple appointments that were essential. But this past weekend as I saw her light up and enjoy spending time with my oldest while I cleaned, it reminded me how hard this is for EVERYONE. She has been ALONE with not a lot of in-person human interaction. I can\u2019t imagine how lonely the last 6 months have been! I forgot how hard this has been on her. Just because she is \u201Cstaying safe\u201D from threats of the virus doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t struggling. \n\nSometimes we get so caught up in our own issues or busyness of life that we forget to stop and put ourselves in someone else\u2019s shoes. \n\nSo today dear friend, I challenge you to think about your neighbor or coworker or friend who may be really struggling and could use some love today.

ZÃåizÃåek menggunakan berbagai paradoks untuk mengungkap realita yang seringkali tidak terpikirkan di benak banyak orang. Realita ketidakmampuan kekuasaan dalam menangani pandemik, ditelanjangi oleh ZÃåizÃåek dalam buku ini.\n\nBaginya, kepanikan dalam menghadapi Covid-19 menunjukan bahwa wabah ini tidak dianggap sebagai ancaman serius. Panik! adalah ancaman bagi pasar, karena kepanikan akan membunyikan lonceng kematian bagi imperium bisnis. Kepanikan akan membuat semua orang ketakutan melakukan aktivitas ekonomi, industri berhenti berproduksi karena tidak ada konsumsi, sedangkan para pebisnis berebut untuk menyelamatkan kekayaan karena takut akan dilenyapkan krisis. Sistem pasar benar-benar tidak siap menghadapi pandemik. Sehingga menurut ZÃåizÃåek, masyarakat tanpa kelas adalah satu-satunya jalan untuk mencegah kehancuran dunia karena barbarisme sistem pasar ini.\n\nInfo Buku dan Pemesanan :\n\u2022Whatsapp 08117561677\n\u2022Gratis Ongkir Xtra via Shopee\/bukubodat\n\u2022Discon Khusus via WA\/DM\n\u2022OriginalüíØ\n*\n*\n*\n#bukubodat #pandemic #pandemic2020 #pandemicorona #bukucovid19 #covid19indonesia #slavojzÃåizÃåek #bukuslavojzizek #bukuterjemahan #bukuoriginal @penerbitindependen #covid19indonesia #covid19","NumberOfLikes":10,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Buku Bodat. on August 10, 2020 tagging @penerbitindependen.

It was brought to my attention by one of my consumers that we need to have more conversations over how PWD\u2019s access to healthcare has been affected by COVID-19 pandemic. \nI would like to invite you to participate in a conversation about the ways COVID19 is affecting PWD\u2019s access healthcare services. In this meeting I would like to discuss about the healthcare issues and concerns consumers and health care workers might have about discrimination against PWDs and other issues during the COVID19 pandemic.\nBelow is a list of questions I would like for us to focus and have a dialog on: \n-\tWhat forms of discrimination and neglect are PWDs experiencing when trying to access\/obtain medical services? \n-\tWhat are other barriers PWDs face regarding accessibility to medical services, and which of those barriers have been exacerbated by this pandemic? \n-\tWhat fears and concerns do PWDs have when seeking medical treatment during this pandemic? \n-\tWhat are possible solutions to solve these issues? What can be done, how can it be done, and how long could be expected to have this issues resolved \/fixed? \nAs well as other possible questions that other participants may have.

Pluto = death and rebirth, wealth, shadow, the underworld, power, control, compulsion. If you\u2019ve been paying attention you\u2019ll remember that squares are areas of tension in astrology.  We have reached a face off between Mars and Pluto. The moon in Taurus today also adds stubbornness and resistance to change.

However, if tested too early or late, the test will not be able to pick up the virus in your body.\n\nWhen a virus enters your body, it takes time for it to replicate or produce enough of themselves to make you sick. Hence, a 2 weeks quarantine is often required. At this early stage when you are not sick yet, the viral test will be negative.\n\nIn another scenario when you visit the doctor too late, after showing symptoms for a few days and is probably feeling better. At this point, your immune system has started producing antibodies to clear the virus from attacking your body. A viral test will show a negative result.
