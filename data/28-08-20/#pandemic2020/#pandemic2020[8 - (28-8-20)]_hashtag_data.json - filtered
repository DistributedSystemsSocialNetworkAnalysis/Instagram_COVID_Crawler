I\u2019m beyond honoured to have him as a guest.\n*\nParker Johnson is a group facilitator, mediator, intercultural educator, and organizational change specialist committed to building just, equitable, diverse and inclusive organizations. With his diverse array of interests, skills and experiences, he possesses a deep-level understanding of intersectionality.\n*\nParker studied administration, planning and social policy at the Harvard University Graduate School of Education, and rounds out his education with practical application in mediation, coaching, intercultural communication and anti-oppression work.\n*\nHis graduate work in diversity and inclusion focused on research, teaching, policy, curriculum development and organizational change. While Parker enjoys the rich, creative and transformative nature of theory and research, it\u2019s their application which interests him most.\n*\nIn his employment equity role with the City of Vancouver, he delivered inclusive and respectful workplace workshops, conflict mediation and investigations, and employment outreach to diverse communities.\n *\nHis specialty is post-secondary institutions where he counsels on both staff and leadership development as well as curriculum revisions. As a workshop facilitator, he\u2019s a master at bringing concepts alive through the power of storytelling.\n*\n\nUnlearn racism. Learn antiracism. Support our arts, our talents and our businesses.

That\u2019s what happened to me when I saw the hilarious, coming-of-age, indie comedy \u201CBooksmart\u201D last year. So, for today\u2019s stop on my pandemic Hollywood tour I thought it would be fun to check out Molly\u2019s retro apartment complex from this laugh out loud film. \n\nDesigned in 1953 by architect Lionel V. Mayell, the Villa San Pasqual complex where Molly lives in the film is located at \u202A1000 San Pasqual Street in Pasadena\u202C. This super cool retro complex with its pink and turquoise color combo is a designated Pasadena landmark. Molly\u2019s apartment unit is located in the complex\u2019s southeastern-most building, on South Catalina Avenue. Please note that this is a private residence so if you visit please do not trespass or disturb the people that live there.\n\nDirected by Olivia Wilde (in her feature directorial debut), \u201CBooksmart,\u201D stars Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever as high school seniors Amy and Molly -  best friends since childhood and academic overachievers - who have only cared about their grade point average their entire time in high school. But on the eve of graduation, they suddenly realize that they may have missed out on the special moments of their teenage years. Determined to make up for lost time, the girls decide to cram four years of not-to-be missed fun into one night \u2014 thus a chaotic adventure that no amount of book smarts could prepare them for ensues.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t seen this fun film yet\u2026\u201CBooksmart\u201D is currently streaming on Hulu.\n\nFun facts - Director, Olivia Wilde encouraged Kaitlyn Dever and Beanie Feldstein to spend time living together to really build up a rapport between the two girls. The two ended up being roommates for 10 weeks.\n\nIn the film, Amy is a lesbian and Molly is straight. In real life, the opposite is true: Beanie Feldstein is a lesbian and Kaitlyn Dever is straight. \n\nScreenwriter Katie Silberman said that Billie Lourd (who plays the drug-crazies Gigi) did such an impressive performance that extra scenes were written specifically for her. #filminglocation #booksmart #beaniefeldstein #pasadena #hollywoodtour #pandemic2020 #wearamask😷 #tonymiros @booksmart","NumberOfLikes":59,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":6,"Timestamp":1596996377,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 09 20:06:17 CEST 2020","Location":"Pasadena, California"},{"CaptionText":"#bikhre_ehsaas #ehsaas #collegelove #lovequotes #shayarilove #hindipoetry #poetrycommunity #memories💕 #mehfileshayari #ektarfapyaar #pandemic2020 #lockdown #corona #instagram","NumberOfLikes":3,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by बिखरे~एहसास on August 09, 2020 tagging @prachisultania.ps.

This river is constantly gathering garbage and collecting it on its banks. What's even more sad and heart wrenching is there is a constant traffic of people to enjoy it's scenery. My question is how does everyone just over look it, see past our own tragedy? Have we just become so numb and used to it that now it's a lost cause? \n.\nI ask you do you love mother earth? Do you deep down believe in your heart that she loves you back just as much if not more? Whatever your answer is, I want you to know no matter how much you think she doesn't love you, she does. She can see through every mistake and shadow you have, she just wants you to see it too. \n.\nI find it so important to show her in many ways then one that I love her, seeing her anguish calls to my heart. Can you hear her call, do you see her call? If you do, take part. Show our younger earth warriors what this earth needs. CHANGE, ACTION, GUIDANCE and KNOWLEDGE. Carry your tools to make it right, whatever they are. It can be a bucket and a spear but just lead with your full and open heart. Feel her pain so we can feel her love.\n.\nThis pandemic has shown us all how we are connected.

Trust me, I am aware HOWEVER 165,070 American deaths in just 6 months makes it to where I can not shut up without it going against everything I have tried to stand for. I will respect your \"choices\" on anything I possibly can, but when it comes to a PANDEMIC that is taking so many lives (or other serious issues like racism) I have no choice but to let you know the reality of what your \"choice\" means. If people like me don't keep standing up for the right side of these moral\/ethical issues, we aren't going to have a country. Things are getting much too volatile. There WILL eventually be a real breaking point, and we need enough people seeing the right side in order to prevent that breaking point from being pure destruction of everything we know. America CAN be a strong, good country. It really could be great, if we could get it right instead of making everything all about money. So I have to keep fighting for the right thing even though the majority of those around me think I'm unladylike, a troublemaker, \"too much,\" unkind, and many other negative things. And I have to put up with that, and continue on, even though it hurts, because it's not about pleasing people. It's about keeping them alive.

The initial planned date was May 30th to big fan fair, but the pandemic shut that down. We didn\u2019t see it happening like this, but the most important thing... is finding the right person. I love @catkeithleylawson with all of my heart and I am proud to be her husband. \n\nWe didn\u2019t know we were getting married on this day. We were supposed to get our marriage license but in the car ride down to Laguna Hills Governor Newsom announced the second shut down of all non-essential businesses. \n\nAfter an hour of driving, we arrived and they said they\u2019ll be closing their offices and won\u2019t know when they\u2019ll open again. So... in our t-shirts we tied the knot. \n\nWith plexi glass between the county clerk and us, we were pronounced husband and wife and kissed with masks on. We used sanitizer before and after. \n\nHer wedding dress will be stored away until the pandemic is over and we can have a ceremony and celebration. \n\nSo... here\u2019s a piece of our story. Hopefully this sheds some light on anyone planning or thinking about a wedding during a pandemic. \n\nIn many ways, stripping everything away from what is \u201Csupposed\u201D to be a wedding made it even more special, raw.... and human.

If this mansion - built in 1929 - looks familiar to you that\u2019s because it\u2019s been featured on several movies and TV shows over the years. The most famous.... it was the Tate mansion on the ABC comedy series \u201CSoap\u201D in the 1970\u2019s! Please note that this is a private residence so if you visit please do not trespass or disturb the people that live there.\n\nThis hit series has been nominated for 3 Primetime Emmy Awards this year - Outstanding Limited Series, Kerry Washington for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie and Lynn Shelton for Outstanding Directing for a Limited Series, Movie or Dramatic Special. \n\nLittle Fires Everywhere is currently streaming on Hulu\n\nFun facts - the Richardson home was also featured the 1982 horror movie \u201COne Dark Night\u201D, and episodes of the series \u201CShameless\u201D (2012), \u201CGrace and Frankie\u201D (2015), \u201CThe Last Tycoon\u201D (2017) and \u201CThe Unicorn\u201D (2020).\n\nWhile at the hair salon, Elena (Witherspoon) suggests that her daughter Izzy gets her hair cut similar to Rachel's from Friends (1994).

Those days when you wake up feeling inadequate, like nothing is enough and everything is too much. Those days when you are carrying the weight of the world and don't to anymore. You want to be more like other people. People who don't have a care in the world. Who can act like nothing is happening, like the world isn't literally changing around us in monumental ways. You want to just wake up and stop caring anymore because it doesn't make a damn bit of difference. Yes, it was apparently supposed to be a pity party kind of day around here! And I could have chosen to sit in it and let it turn me bitter and angry. \n\nInstead I chose to get up. I did laundry, I cleaned the kitchen, I watched a movie with my kids and then, I went on a walk. At one point I looked down and I was being encircled by these butterflies. There were 3 of them just dancing around me and literally stopped me in my tracks. Down the path a little bit further there was another flock of butterflies that came over and flew around me. I've always believed when I see a butterfly that it represents the soul of someone that I have loved who has gone on to the next journey of their life. It was like they were there this afternoon letting me know that they're still here. I'm not going to lie it made me cry! I've been feeling so alone lately, it was a beautiful reminder that we never are really alone. \n\n#butterflies #butterflyvisitor #mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #anxiety #anxietyisajoythief #endthestigma #pandemic2020 #inthetimeofcorona","NumberOfLikes":16,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1596907654,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 08 19:27:34 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Adult pattern mask!

Why do I sell skincare and makeup? 😬😄\nMy one year anniversary as a @beautycounter consultant is coming up next month and this topic has been on my mind lately as I reflect on my past year with the company. \n\n✨ First, I have and always will LOVE the products and the results it\u2019s proven for me and my skin.  I know all the products were safe during my pregnancy and for breastfeeding and now it\u2019s safe and clean for my boys and even my husband (he doesn\u2019t really have a choice 😆). \n\n✨ This next point has taken precedence over all reasons the last few months since the pandemic hit our nation.  With shaky and uncertain times ahead, it\u2019s been so nice to help SUPPORT MY FAMILY with this small business.  That\u2019s why I\u2019ve grown my team and that\u2019s why I continue to reach out to you again and again. It\u2019s the perfect side gig to do in the luxury of my home while taking care of my two boys as a stay-at-home mom. \n\n✨ And I really believe in the company\u2019s MISSION to get safer products into the hands of everyone. Beauty should be good for you. Therefore, I\u2019m not ashamed to share my passion for the products and to sell skincare and makeup to you 😊. It\u2019s been amazing being a part of this wonderful supportive group of women. \n\nTHANK YOU to all my family and friends who have been supportive thus far.  When I say I appreciate your support, I mean it truly from the bottom of my heart ❤️ Keep me in mind as you need gifts for your moms, mother-in-laws, sisters, teachers, girlfriends and even all the men in your life.  Referrals are always much appreciated in this business 🥰. And if you ever want to join the cause or my team, I would love to do this together with you 🙌🏻. \n\n#beautycounter #beautycounterconsultant #betterbeauty #cleanbeauty #cleanandsafeproducts #smallbusiness #skincare #makeup #sahm #sahmomlife #thankyouforyoursupport #wfh #supportsmallbusiness #pandemic2020 #supportingmyfamily #coronavirus #joinme #beautyshouldbegoodforyou #beautycountercosmetics #beautycountermission #sidehustle #hustle #sidegig #gottapaythebills #gottadowhatigottado #hustling #novamom #novamoms #novafamily #arlingtonva","NumberOfLikes":78,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Tina Yoon Kyung Flippo in Arlington, Virginia with @beautycounter, @tinaflippo, @sass_photo, and @sjasonflippo.

It's a bit different from the Russian one. The rest is in comments\n\n********\n\nMy pandemic notes. 2020\n\n\"The Personal is Political.\"\n\nCarol Hanisch, 1969\n\n\"From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an Iron Curtain has descended across the Continent.\"\n\nWinston Churchill, 1946\n\n\"I could walk barefoot to Belgrade,\nAnd the snow would smoke under my soles\nAnd swallows would fly towards me,\nBut the border is closed as your heart.\"\n\nElena Shirman, 1941\n\n****\nHistory does not repeat itself\nit only seems that everything goes in a spiral\nIt rather ironically \noverturns the former scenario according to the rules of postmodernity.\n\nMay 2020. I am on the street in Warsaw. People in sanitary masks are walking towards me. I wonder, when did we get into a post-apocalyptic movie?\n\nFebruary 2020. We are sitting alone, two world travelers, in the empty concert hall in some city in the middle of Poland, drinking Jägermeister, sharing memories of past adventures. My conversation partner mentions his fear of coronavirus. I laugh at him, what do you know about China? I lived there, I was wearing a mask, so as not to suffocate from the toxic fog in Beijing. The Chinese know how to scare the West. Everything will be all right, trust me. I survived there. Moreover, I grew up in Vladivostok, right on the border with North Korea. Kim Jong-un's rockets are another regular joke for me. You can't scare me so easily. And I seem to have luck.\n\nEarly March 2020. I am in Moscow on a research trip. It's a very strange feeling to visit your homeland after 8 years of living abroad.  Everyone perceives me as Polish, that gives me some relief, explanation for being a foreigner. \n\nSlovakia closes the borders - I am writing to my friend in Kosice, what is going on, you have only 2.5 registered cases in your country, how can I come visit you now?\n\nMarch 15 - Poland closes the borders after Germany. Almost the entire EU is locked down. Can't believe. What's happening? I cannot get caught up in Russia.","NumberOfLikes":18,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Anna's (not)ordinary blog in Warszawa.

I just wanted to give you all an update. I am still creating a batch of new face shield designs for Fall\/Autumn. I have to admit that a week alone was not enough time to get this done as well as to catch up with myself. \u2063\n\u2063\nHalf of my week goes to my part time job and the rest of the days go to me designing and thinking up color combos for the new designs. I also have not been feeling that great this week. I had a monstrous migraine from Sunday night to Wednesday night. I started feeling better on Thursday and Friday, but I still had the headache on and off as well as some back pain. \u2063\n\u2063\nI have started taking care of myself again since I worked too much lately. I am having a good start doing that as I have begun to feel better as well. I just wanted to give you all an update as to where I am at.\u2063\n\u2063\nI will have the new designs, but they will be trickling down bit by bit all throughout next week and the weeks following that. Come each week to check out all the new awesome stuff I will launch each week. I am still very very excited about the new releases. 💗🙂😊\u2063\n\u2063\nI will for sure be posting them on here as well. Shipping times will be back to normal, (or 1-2 weeks), starting Monday, August 10th. \u2063\n\u2063\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014🌸\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2063\n\u2063\nFor anyone curious about my photo-any guesses as to what this is? This item which is also in my shop, is an ear saver or face mask elastic holder for those fatigued ears, holding up those face masks all day. I don\u2019t know about you, but after a long day at work, the face mask elastics can really do a number on your ears. These pretty combs have been handy for me to bring to my part time job to help give my ears relief by holding the straps. They are not only subtle, but also stylish to boot. What do you know? I love cute gear and accessories that are functional as well.\u2063\n\u2063\nI am looking forward to welcoming all of you back to my shop on Monday. I plan on posting on this IG account on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays. Keep an eye out for new product launches and other fun, pretty illustrated, hand painted  stuff! See you all then!

The government would use the extra spending, worth 25 billion euros (23 billion pounds), to soften the blow to an economy ravaged by lockdown measures imposed to stem the COVID-19 pandemic, which has killed almost 35,200 people. Italy hopes to front-load this year part of 209 billion euros in grants and cheap loans it should receive from the Recovery Fund starting in 2021. The Italian economy has been among the worst hit by the crisis, facing an 11.2% contraction this year, according to European Union estimates, the sharpest fall in the 27-nation bloc. \u201CWe have set aside 12 billion euros to support employment,\u201D Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told reporters after a three-hour Cabinet meeting. Part of the borrowing will be used to conditionally extend temporary layoff schemes for up to 18 weeks, with firms required not to cut jobs to qualify for state aid. Companies less affected by the crisis will have to pay a contribution to apply for aid covering a period which exceeds the first nine weeks, a draft decree seen by Reuters showed.\n.\n.\nDo follow and share @the_recent.column for latest updates.\n.\n.\n#italy_stop #italianfood #italygram #instaitaly #italy #italytrip #recentcolumn #therecentcolumn #worldgram #romania #romantic #rome #romeitaly #rome🇮🇹 #europeanunion #europeanstyle #europe #european #pandemic2020 #stimuluspackage #businessinvestment #businessleadership #travelling #tourism #businessupdates #instanewsdaily #infographic #infogram #infographic #youtube #youtubevideos","NumberOfLikes":15,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The_Recent.Column on August 08, 2020.

Первая неделя онлайн школы пятиклассника.\n\nworksheets➡️\n\nSo, yeah, that's it. The school year of 20-21 has started. And, here in Arizona, we have finished the first week of online school already! My son, Sasha who is 10, is a 5th grader. He attends a small (only two 5th grades) school in Yuma, AZ. The school started on Monday, August 3rd. The state decided that all schools are gonna be 💯 online until September 8th and then... oh well, who knows what... \n\nAnyways. What did he do this week? We had a meeting with his teacher for 30 min, picked up his iPad, and did some worksheets. \n\nThe worksheets (see➡️) were very interesting. We had a lot of fun talking about emotions and behavior. The sad thing is though that not all the parents are like me... There are a lot of parents who do not talk about the school work with their kids at all (sad statistics 😭). So, I wish the teacher would have recorded a video about each worksheet talking more about each topic. \n\nHow long do you think a discussion of each worksheet with a 10 year old can be? What would you do\/say in each situation?\n\nНу вот и все. Начался учебный год 20-21. A здесь, в Аризоне, мы уже закончили первую неделю школы! Моему сыну, Саше, 10 лет и он ходит в 5й класс. Он посещает маленькую школу (только два 5ых класса) в Юме, штат Аризона. Школа началась 3 августа. Пока школа 💯 онлайн до 8 сентября ну а дальше хз...\n\nНу да ладно. Что же он делал эту неделю? У него была встреча с учительницей на 30 минут, мы забрали его Айпад, и работали над заданиями.\n\nЗадания (смотри ➡️) были очень интересными. Нам было весело разговаривать о чувствах и эмоциях. Проблема правда в том что не все родители как я... Многие родители не обсуждают школьные задания с ребенком (грустная статистика😭).

А что бы вы сделали\/сказали в каждой ситуации?\n\n#covid_19 #covid19 #covid #covid\n#onlineschool #school #5thgrade #elementaryteacher #pandemic #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife #onlineschooling","NumberOfLikes":4,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1596873634,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 08 10:00:34 CEST 2020","Location":"Alice Byrne Elementary School"},{"CaptionText":"Asics Amplica Black \n\n100% Original Authentic \n(Garansi uang kembali apabila tidak Original)\n\n100% Trusted (Est. 2019)\n(Bukan Sepatu KW, PREMIUM, dan Sejenisnya) \n\n-Brand New In Box-\nMade In Vietnam\nSepatu Lengkap Beserta BOX (Free Sticker EL&CAS)\n\nArtikel : T825N-003\n(Tulis Artikel di Mesin Pencarian, Google dll.)\n\nTersedia Size :\n\n44 (28 Cm) = 1\n\nPrice : Rp. 400.000\n\n*Produk baru seperti di gambar.\n*Stok di deskripsi sudah pasti tersedia.\n*Stock kami terbatas dan tidak stock kembali (Checkout sebelum kehabisan).\n*(Fast Response).\n\nNOTE : Garansi tidak berlaku apabila tidak disertai Video Unboxing\n\n#sneakersmania #casual #sport #sneakersindo #sneakersmurah #jakarta #jualanonline #sneakersjakarta #asicsoriginal #asicsnimbus #asicsgelnimbus #asicsphoenix #asics #asicsrunning #asicsbadminton #asicsgellyte #asicsgelpatriot8 #asicstigerquestion #asicstigersale #asicsindonesia\n#asicscasualmurah #murah #futsal #pandemic2020 #underarmour #pandemic #covid19 #liputan6 #jakartasneakersday","NumberOfLikes":1,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1596873623,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 08 10:00:23 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Our new normal. 😷 #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":20,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by LaChelle Palmer Smith in Georgia Aquarium.

I had fun playing with some filters taking pictures, the first photo has no filter.\n\nThis mural represents so much that has happened in my life this year and I have re-written this caption 10 times over struggling to find the words.\n\nI think Garth Brooks really said it best in his Netflix documentary, \u201CEvery blessing is also a curse, but every curse is also a blessing.\u201D\n\nFor myself and my wife the curse of the pandemic has forced us into more self-isolation than most due to the unknowns of what COVID-19 could do to a fetus or long term health effects of the child.  The blessing is that I have been working from home since March and have not had to fly to site every week, so I have been able to assist and help my wife everyday and been able to attend all the virtual baby classes and most doctor appointments I would have likely missed otherwise.  I have also had more free time without the commutes and being home every night and decided I wanted to do something special for our child in the nursery.\n\nAfter some Pinterest scrolling I had seen some interesting ombré mountain murals others had done and realized I had the perfect picture I could paint on the wall myself.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t recognize the location, this is Waterton National Park, standing on the bluff near the Prince of Wales hotel.  This is one of Megan and I favourite locations and most memorable places to visit so it holds a special place in our hearts.\n\nAfter days of planning and days of prepping the wall for paint and sketching the enlarged mural on the wall.  Painting took over a few months during my days off to complete and has been difficult during hot summer days in a small room.\n\nThis has been a huge process and I could not be more happy with the way it looks and surprising myself with my amateur painting ability to accomplish the design and vision I had when I started.  This will forever be a memory, a reminder of 2020 and a story for the rest of my life.\n\nI can\u2019t wait to share this with my child for years to come.\n#pandemic2020 #prouddad","NumberOfLikes":21,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":14,"Timestamp":1596856190,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 08 05:09:50 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"2020 mask making to help keep loved 💕 ones safe!! \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#kathieslovinglife #2020\n#2020summer #pandemic #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife #pandemicfashion #pandemicprojects #pandemictimes #besafe #besafebekind #frontlineworkerappreciation","NumberOfLikes":7,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1596855506,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 08 04:58:26 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"2020 fashion statement.

Ground yourself in science- Resist viewing or reading sensational news or social media, where facts are often blurred or exaggerated. Instead, reach out to your local health or state department of health for up-to-date information on COVID-19. Science-based facts will help ground you in a reality where truth, hope, and interventions exist. \u2063\n\u2063\n2. Isolate but stay connected to others- Protect yourself with social distance and homebound activities. But make sure to keep your attachments to friends, family, and loved ones by calling, texting, using FaceTime, Skype, or Zoom. \u2063\n\u2063\n3. Think locally, not globally- Focus on what is happening in your local community and what you can do to keep yourself and neighbors healthy and safe. \u2063\n\u2063\n4. Practice self-care- Be mindful of eating well, keeping a healthy sleep cycle, exercising, and other soothing self-care behaviors. Make sure to avoid using alcohol or drugs to cope with stress. And limit caffeine, as it heightens anxiety and irritability.\u2063\n\u2063\n5.Fight helplessness by finding a purpose- The uncertainty that COVID-19 brings can leave many of us feeling unspeakably helpless. Finding purpose can alleviate restlessness and anxiety. Choose things you can control, be it shifting negative thoughts into positive ones, deciding what to cook for lunch, reading a good book, picking what movie you and the kids will watch, or other activities you have power over. \u2063\n\u2063\n#youmatter\u2063","NumberOfLikes":23,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Leigha Kosakowski | Coach 🧠 in Charlotte, North Carolina with @youmatter.mh.
