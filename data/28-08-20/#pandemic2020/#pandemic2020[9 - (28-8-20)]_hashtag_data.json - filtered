A moment to breathe and decide what you want your life to look like moving forward. An opportunity to invest in yourself. A time to focus on social injustices and educate yourself.\n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong- I have my moments of anger and loneliness- lots of them. I miss my parents and my brother like crazy and I\u2019m incredibly frustrated about distance learning and what it will mean for working parents.  BUT- this gives me an opportunity to slow down. Breathe. Re-evaluate. It gives me a chance to reflect on the intention of starting my own practice- to have flexibility and spend more time with my children.\n\nAnd just like that a flip in perspective- my private practice goals are being fulfilled in this pandemic. I GET to spend more time with my kids and I GET to exercise that flexibility in my small business. Maybe this year I won\u2019t crush it at work, but I can aim to crush it at home because of the life I\u2019ve designed.\n\nTry it. Try changing your perspective. Maybe you didn\u2019t have time to work on your branding and website before. Maybe working out was difficult to fit into your schedule. Or cooking. Maybe you have been wanting to read more or catch up on a great tv show. Maybe you\u2019ve been needing a reason to become more politically active. Maybe you needed to reignite the passion in your career. Maybe you\u2019ve needed some extra time and patience with your child who has been acting out. Maybe you need more time carved out for self care.\n\nIntroducing \u201CThe WINS are bigger\u201D underscrub as part of the new icons collection.

Approximately 80% of those with COVID-19 end up having a mild response and most of those cases resolve in about two weeks. For people who have a severe response to the virus, it can take between three and six weeks to recover.\n\nBUT NOW, there is growing concern over a separate group who don\u2019t seem to fall into either of those categories. A number of people are now reporting lingering #symptoms of the illness for one, two or even three months. This new group is mixed with those who experienced both mild and severe cases. As health experts step in to try to manage these patients and learn more, many are referring to this group as coronavirus \u201Clong-haulers\u201D or \u201Clong-termers.\u201D\n\n\u201CWe\u2019re now seeing a percentage of patients whose symptoms seem to be lasting a while,\u201D explains family medicine provider Christopher Babiuch, MD. \u201CThis is challenging because everyone\u2019s needs are so unique. We\u2019re finding that collaborating as a team between different specialists helps to manage and support these patients, but there\u2019s a lot that we just don\u2019t know yet.\u201D - health.clevelandclinic.org #iahsay \n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n#selflessness #Millennial\u2019s #CommunityOriented #Selfless #Humankind #HumanKindness #Thoughtful #Community #WearAMask #Mask #AMaskIsNotAPoliticalStatement #HealthcareWorkers #HealthcareHeroes #Pandemic2020 #Quarantine2020 #SocialDistancing #Longterm #Longhaul #NeurologicalIssues #Braindamaged #LungDamage #CognitiveFunction #fridayforfuture","NumberOfLikes":97,"Hashtags":["#sideeffects","#aftereffects","#COVID19","#Coronavirus","#symptoms","#iahsay","#selflessness","#Millennial\u2019s","#CommunityOriented","#Selfless","#Humankind","#HumanKindness","#Thoughtful","#Community","#WearAMask","#Mask","#AMaskIsNotAPoliticalStatement","#HealthcareWorkers","#HealthcareHeroes","#Pandemic2020","#Quarantine2020","#SocialDistancing","#Longterm","#Longhaul","#NeurologicalIssues","#Braindamaged","#LungDamage","#CognitiveFunction","#fridayforfuture"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by i am human | so are you in Planet Earth.

But for how long?\n\nIt\u2019s been learnt that the Central government is trying to work out a phase-wise plan to reopen schools and educational institutes between September 1 and November 14. The government is likely to unveil its final Unlock guidelines later this month.\n\nAll educational institutes have been closed in India since March 24, when the Union government announced lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus pandemic. Schools, colleges and universities have been relying on online mode since then to teach students and conduct examinations\n\nThe specifics about reopening educational institutes are being formulated by the secretaries and Group of Ministers (GoM) on COVID-19 management, according to a report in The Economic Times.\n\nSources said that the government will issue broad Standard Operation Procedures (SOPs), and leave the decision on when and how to restart classroom teaching to the respective state governments.\n\nThe suggestion is that Class 10 and Class 12 students be asked to attend school for the first 15 days after reopening of schools. Class 6 to 9 students will then be asked to go to schools with restricted hours.\n\nThe entire batch of one class will, however, not attend school the same day initially. Different sections of a class will have specific days assigned for attending school.\n\nSanitisation of classrooms will be a major highlight of the Centre\u2019s SOP. Schools will be asked to operate in shifts \u2013 for instance, from 8 to 11 am and 12 noon to 3 pm, with an hour\u2019s gap for the process of thorough sanitisation.\n\n#school #reopening #pandemic2020 #covidnorms #guidelines #sop #sanitization #socialdistancing #backtoschool #students #education #educationalert #newnormal #odishabytesnews #odishabytes","NumberOfLikes":9,"Hashtags":["#school","#reopening","#pandemic2020","#covidnorms","#guidelines","#sop","#sanitization","#socialdistancing","#backtoschool","#students","#education","#educationalert","#newnormal","#odishabytesnews","#odishabytes"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Odisha Bytes in Bhubaneswar, India.

What they got far exceeded that, reports FAMSF executive director and CEO Thomas Campbell.\n\nSome 6,190 artists from the nine Bay Area counties applied to be part of the exhibition and sent images of 11,518 artworks\n\nThe exhibition had previously been scheduled for next spring, but was moved up when the coronavirus pandemic upended the museum\u2019s schedule.\n\nAlthough the museum is unsure when it will be able to install the show or allow visitors back into galleries because of delays with California\u2019s reopening, news of artists\u2019 acceptance in the exhibition comes at a time when many are struggling. The work, which will be exhibited online in addition to the de Young\u2019s large Herbst galleries on the lower level, will also be available for sale with 100% of proceeds going directly to the artists.\"\n\n\"We have a lot of interesting artists emerging from Bay Area all the time.

But several others have used the time as an opportunity to excel. For instance, take the case of Ved Vikash Sahoo.\n\nThe city-based Ved Vikash, who used to sell tea, has unleashed the creative instinct in him to turn into an amazing craftsman.\n\nHe has been using old newspaper to depict Odisha\u2019s art and culture. Among his creations are the iconic Eiffel tower and many home decor items. He has been doing paintings also.\n\n\u201CI started working on all these from the early days of lockdown,\u201D said the chaiwala.\n\n\u201CI have a cafe in a van in the Infocity area here. When lockdown started, I was very stressed with my business. To divert my mind, I started doing these crafts,\u201D he revealed.\n\n\u201CI was passionate about painting and doing crafts since my childhood. But I had not been getting time to pursue it. During lockdown, I got ample time to work on my passion,\u201D he remarked.\n\n\u201CI am making these crafts with paper only, using glue and water colour if necessary. I observed that people waste old newspapers, so I thought of reusing them in my work. I roll the papers neatly and stick them in various shapes with the help of glue,\u201D said Ved Vikash.\n\n\u201CI have made more than 30 crafts during lockdown period so far, including Lord Jagannath, Konark temple, Shri Khetra, Chariots of Lord Jagannath, Balabhadra and Devi Subhadra, Eiffel tower and many more,\u201D he informed.\n\nHis latest \u2018project\u2019 is Ram Mandir. \u201CI started making Ram Mandir from its Bhoomi Pujan day,\u201D he added.\n\nVed Vikash\u2019s dream is to train teach school children his craft. \u201CI want to promote art and culture of Odisha through this,\u201D Ved Vikash said.\n\nVed Vikash, who is from Patnagarh in Balangir district, came to Bhubaneswar three years ago. He did a course on Hotel Management and worked in the hotel industry for five years outside Odisha.\n\n#craft #artisans #pandemic2020 #COVID19 #art #craft #odisha #bhubaneswar #odishabytesnews #odishabytes #news #breakingnews #followus #moreupdates #papercraft #craftfromscratch","NumberOfLikes":27,"Hashtags":["#craft","#artisans","#pandemic2020","#COVID19","#art","#craft","#odisha","#bhubaneswar","#odishabytesnews","#odishabytes","#news","#breakingnews","#followus","#moreupdates","#papercraft","#craftfromscratch"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1596731088,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 06 18:24:48 CEST 2020","Location":"Bhubaneswar, India"},{"Owner":"wendypoczatek","CaptionText":"Our family lost 2 beautiful souls last week.

I was 3 when I had to be put in a room by myself, for scarlet fever, in a communist hospital, for 10 days. I learned that health has no price and so to me, to us staying at home right now is the right choice. \n\nI understand that not everyone has the same situation and it is harder to make this choice. Going to work and risking your health is the only choice and you have to be there to support your family. I am thinking of all of you that have to do that. \n\nOn the other hand I cannot stand seeing the other side of things, where people do things that aren\u2019t safe or right and they seem proud of it. Activities that aren\u2019t essential and don\u2019t seem in tandem with the health officials\u2019s advice.\nI understand your arrogance about \u201Cthis is America, this is my right, I am free to do whatever\u201D. Well not in a pandemic, where your activities could affect me and the other way around. I find it pretty powerful that we can affect each other\u2019s lives so easily right now. \nI am trying really hard to understand the independence and individualism that this society is so proud of but it doesn\u2019t work right now. Uncomfortable or not we have to become less selfish and do the right thing. \nIt is not just about the virus either. The longer we don\u2019t act right, the harsher the consequences will be.

Here are some tips to help you keep stress at bay.\n\nKeep a positive attitude.\n\nAccept that there are events that you cannot control.\n\nBe assertive instead of aggressive. Assert your feelings, opinions, or beliefs instead of becoming angry, defensive, or passive.\n\nLearn and practice relaxation techniques; try meditation, yoga, or tai-chi for stress management.\n\nExercise regularly. Your body can fight stress better when it is fit.\n\nEat healthy, well-balanced meals.\n\nLearn to manage your time more effectively.\n\nSet limits appropriately and learn to say no to requests that would create excessive stress in your life.\n\nMake time for hobbies, interests, and relaxation.\n\nGet enough rest and sleep. Your body needs time to recover from stressful events.\n\nDon't rely on alcohol, drugs, or compulsive behaviors to reduce stress.\n\nSeek out social support. Spend enough time with those you enjoy.\n\nSeek treatment with a psychologist or other mental health professional trained in stress management or biofeedback techniques to learn healthy ways of dealing with the stress in your life\n\nSource:https:\/\/www.webmd.com\/balance\/stress-management\/stress-management","NumberOfLikes":29,"Hashtags":["#latepost📷","#oldsketch","#digitalillustration","#stress","#life","#anxiety","#mentalhealthawareness","#bottledu","#emotionalhealth","#emotionalsupportanimal","#family","#newag","#loan","#socialpressur","#pandemic2020","#covi","#psycholog","#psychosomatic"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Amruta Thakur on August 06, 2020 tagging @advocating.mentalhealth, and @letstalk.mentalhealth.

So many lost count of their loses. life is being different yet hard. So many are exhausted in a way or other. So why not be gentle with each other? why not spread love but not hatred? because just try to imagine a world full of good people around and how that makes our problems looks small. so let's create it that way. Nobody is perfect, there is good, there is bad and even worse. But what you give to others is what you will eventually get in return and if not, you will still not regret when you are the one who is the \"good guy\". what if one day you wake up and see this world dissolved just in a moment like salt in a broth? so, pick your phone and call to the one whom you thought you would never call or meet your childhood teacher and thank him\/her or gift a box of crayons to the poor little kid out there and let him draw his dreams or donate and help the needy if you can or any \"act\" of kindness. You dont have to be rich for being kind, but enough courage is. because when you die, You won't be remembered by your religion or social status, you will be remembered by your good deeds so just give them more than they can ever count. Lets try to make this world better for the people around.

I tried wearing dress with the encouragement of my friends but was always very shy. I have body issues like most of the women.\nUpon coming here, not only that I have been exploring different clothes but looking for occasions to wear dresses. You see, in Nepal people always said that once you leave your country, people copy the westerner pretty fast and change the dressing sense(meaning wearing short dresses or where skin is exposed) but I think coming here has given me confidence to experiment. It also has to do with not being judged and criticized about what I wear. At home, first your parents should allow to wear certain dress. Even if they give permission, you will be stared and judged by neighbors and street side aunties and even relatives which is a nightmare. So, I guess I never dared to try because I feared of being judged on what I wear plus my own insecurities. \n\nI never thought deciding what to wear for myself without thinking once about what would other say is the most liberating feeling.","NumberOfLikes":94,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Anisha in California with @visitcalifornia, @visittheusa, @dametraveler, @nepalitravellers, @joshuatreenps, and @letsgowonder.

Five men and three women - admitted to the ICU ward - died. \n\nAbout 45 patients were admitted to the 50-bed hospital at the time of accident; rest of them have been rescued and shifted to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, a civic hospital in the city, an official said. \n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi condoled the deaths in his home state. \"Saddened by the tragic hospital fire in Ahmedabad. Condolences to the bereaved families. May the injured recover soon. Spoke to CM  @vijayrupanibjp Ji and Mayor @ibijalpatel Ji regarding the situation. Administration is providing all possible assistance to the affected (sic),\" he tweeted this morning.\n\nVisuals from the site showed the fire officials carrying out rescue operations as family members of the patients outside the hospital - disturbed as the news of fire broke - tried to get more information about them.  \n\n\"Ex-gratia of Rs. 2 lakh each from PMNRF would be given to the next of kin of those who have lost their lives due to the hospital fire in Ahmedabad. Rs. 50,000 each would be given to those injured due to the hospital fire,\" a tweet by the Prime Minister's office read. \n\nSources said the blaze broke out due to a short circuit. The bodies of the eight patients have been taken for postmortem. \n\nWith over 65,000 coronavirus cases so far, Gujarat is among the 10 worst-hit states in India by the outbreak. Around 48,000 patients have recovered so far.  \n\nAcross India, over 19 lakh patients have been affected by the pandemic so far; over 39,000 have died due to highly infectious disease.\n#ahemedabad \n#gujrat \n#gujratgovernment \n#ahemdabadhospital\n#coronavirus \n#covid19\n#covidinindia \n#pandemic2020 \n#primeministerofindia \n#narendramodi \n#therealitycheckup","NumberOfLikes":3,"Hashtags":["#ahemedabad","#gujrat","#gujratgovernment","#ahemdabadhospital","#coronavirus","#covid19","#covidinindia","#pandemic2020","#primeministerofindia","#narendramodi","#therealitycheckup"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The Reality Check Up on August 05, 2020.

In the span of 3 weeks my friend @pete_todd2 of the U.K. has lost both his parents to COVID-19. His loving parents had been married for over 60 years.\n\nI met Pete through direct message on Instagram where I respond privately to individuals living with chronic health conditions. Pete had sustained life-threatening injuries from a motorcycle accident. We 1st corresponded on the eve of his reconstructive surgery. The U.K. National Health Services had approved what was to be the world\u2019s first titanium reconstruction of his chest. \nPete\u2019s recovery from this innovative surgery has been fraught with unexpected post surgical side effects. Prior to the appearance of the COVID-19 pandemic he had been scheduled for further reconstructive surgery. Much to his dismay hospitals in the U.K. canceled all elective surgeries as hospitals filled with Covid cases. Now as this courageous man awaits to be scheduled for further surgery he is living with a broken heart.\n\nPlease join me in sending condolences to the Todd family as well as 🙏🙏🏾🙏🏿 for Pete\u2019s health.\n\nThank you. 🙏🙏🏿🙏🏾😷🌏🌎🌍#covid19deaths #covid19 #bereavement #bereavedfamilies #bereaved #mourning #tragedy #sorrowful #sorrow #supportingoneanother #prayers #prayersneeded #prayersfortheworld #prayers🙏 #prayinghands #compassionforall #friendshelpingfriends #death #shockandhorror #pandemic2020 #lifechallenges #changedforever #dearlydeparted #mother #father #grieving \n🙏🌍🙏\n#covid19narratives \n🙏🌍🙏","NumberOfLikes":8,"Hashtags":["#covid19deaths","#covid19","#bereavement","#bereavedfamilies","#bereaved","#mourning","#tragedy","#sorrowful","#sorrow","#supportingoneanother","#prayers","#prayersneeded","#prayersfortheworld","#prayers🙏","#prayinghands","#compassionforall","#friendshelpingfriends","#death","#shockandhorror","#pandemic2020","#lifechallenges","#changedforever","#dearlydeparted","#mother","#father","#grieving","#covid19narratives"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by #1 🌍 COVID Memorial 🇺🇸🇭🇺🇪🇸🇬🇧🇹🇷 in United Kingdom with @bonbonlester.

After the restaurant failed, it was open only for private parties and filming. Eventually, it was torn down in 2005, replaced by a 4-story apartment building. Luckily, the legendary restaurant\u2019s famous porte-cochere, front door and its main entrance, were all incorporated into the design of the apartment building. So it\u2019s famous façade can still be seen just around the corner at the Perino\u2019s Luxury Apartments at \u202A635 South Norton Avenue\u202C in the Wilshire Park area! \n\nOwned by Alexander Perino and designed by renown architect Paul R. Williams in 1950, Perino\u2019s was one of Hollywood's favorite destinations. It was an LA landmark which, like the Brown Derby, Chasen\u2019s, and Romanoff's, was famed for its celebrity clientele during the Hollywood Golden Age. Frank Sinatra played the piano in the bar, Bette Davis permanently reserved her booth, mobster \u201CBugsy\u201D Siegel was a regular patron in the '40s, and Cole Porter supposedly wrote a song on the back of a Perino\u2019s menu.\n\nFun facts - Perino\u2019s shows up a second time in the 1981 film \u201CMommie Dearest\u201D as the eatery where Joan takes her daughter Christina (Diana Scarwid) and gets viciously mad at her over the fact that she has not yet completed her \u201CChristmas card list\u201D.\n\nIn the 2017 FX series \u201CFeud: Bette & Joan\u201D the famous dining room of Perino's was recreated on a soundstage to feature numerous dining scenes for the fictional counterparts of real-life regulars Joan Crawford, Bette Davis and Hedda Hopper on the drama-filled series. #filminglocation #perinosrestaurant #joancrawford #mommiedearest #hollywoodtour #pandemic2020 #socialdistancing #wearamask #tonymiros","NumberOfLikes":48,"Hashtags":["#filminglocation","#perinosrestaurant","#joancrawford","#mommiedearest","#hollywoodtour","#pandemic2020","#socialdistancing","#wearamask","#tonymiros"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1596648109,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 05 19:21:49 CEST 2020","Location":"Perino's Properties"},{"Owner":"nonextquestion","CaptionText":"Government has decided to implement odd\/even system in all kind of vehicles except the essential ones in Kathmandu valley from 6 August 2020 to prevent the increasing number of positive coronavirus cases.

School is now in session. Today's story is about an unrecognized black hero named Henrietta Lacks. Her immortal life would save countless lives and change scientific research forever. \u2063\n\u2063\nHenrietta, 31, married mother of 5 was born in the 1920's. She suffered from cervical cancer.\u2063 \u2063\nDuring a visit to the John Hopkins Center for treatment, her body was looted. Her cervical cells stolen and used for research without her consent. Later these mind blowing cells called HeLa cells would become the first human biological material to be bought and sold world wide. This discovery  launched a multi-billion-dollar industry all of which Henrietta and her family would never be compensated for.\u2063\n\u2063\nPrior to her cells being harvested, cells studied outside of the human body would die after only a few cellular divisions. This made it nearly impossible for any substantial research to be conducted. However, Henrietta's miraculous cells divided endlessly therefore becoming immortal. \u2063\n\u2063\nBefore HeLa cells a woman would receive a hysterectomy for something as simple as a bacterial infection. Now let that sink in. \u2063\n\u2063\nSome 70,000 studies have been published involving the use of HeLa cells and they are in widespread use throughout the field of immunology. At least two Nobel Prizes have been awarded recently for research involving HeLa cells, one on the link between human papilloma virus and cervical cancer (2008 by Harald zur Hausen), which was shared with the discoverers of HIV (Luc Montagnier and Francoise Barre-Sinoussi), and the other into the part played by the telomerase enzyme in preventing chromosome degradation (2009 by Elizabeth Blackburn, Carol Greider and Jack Szostak).\u2063\n\u2063\nSource: British Science for Immunology. \u2063\n\u2063\nA few notable scientific breakthroughs as a result of the HeLa cell:\u2063\n\u2063\n1.) Cancer research.\u2063\n2.) Polio cure.\u2063\n3.) Gene mapping.\u2063\n4.) Chromosome counting.\u2063\n5.) Created the field of virology. \u2063\n6.) HPV vaccines....and the list goes on.\n\n#henreittalacks #science #Immunology #genemapping #blackhistory #HeLa #cancerresearch #blacklivesmatter #BLM #knowyourhistory","NumberOfLikes":7,"Hashtags":["#henreittalacks","#science","#Immunology","#genemapping","#blackhistory","#HeLa","#cancerresearch","#blacklivesmatter","#BLM","#knowyourhistory"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1591795839,"LocalDate":"Wed Jun 10 15:30:39 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"phenomenalkeesh","CaptionText":"Many of us do not know our history so we are destined to repeat it.
