And who wouldn\u2019t!? It\u2019s amazing. Here\u2019s a video of its creation so you can watch the magician in action. \n\n\"Once the pandemic hit, Sara was quickly thrown into a team lead position. She's good at that. I think one story that illustrates her fortitude, pragmatism, humbleness, kindness, dedication, and leadership was after one of the first individuals in Richmond died... who also had COVID-19. The question was \u2013 what caused the death? Was it COVID-19 or something else? Late on a Friday afternoon, one of the physicians with whom she works asked her to find a teammate to go the morgue and \"swab\" a deceased individual to test for COVID-19. Since they didn't know much about the disease, all data was useful. She told her colleague that no one else on her team should have to do that and that she would take on that unsavory task herself.\u2060⠀\n\u2060⠀\n... this conveys how far Sara will go for others \u2013 both her team, patients, and community. That is only one minuscule aspect of the sacrifices she's made but illustrates perfectly who she is. Sara is a human, a leader, a nurse, and a member of our community. I wouldn't have anyone else as a LEADER during COVID-19. If you know a healthcare professional, you should thank them. They are doing more than you know.\"\u2060⠀\n.\u2060⠀\n- Wafa, Sara's wife","NumberOfLikes":38,"Hashtags":["#ArtCards4HealthCarers."],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1596596199,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 05 04:56:39 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"inancho","CaptionText":".\n.\n【2020 Summer Ginza_portrait】\nphotographer @nakaa7riii\nlocation #yurakucho\n.\n【coordinate】\ntops❥︎ @uniqlo_ginza #uniqloginza2020fw\n#エアリズムコットンリブブラタンクトップ\nbottom❥︎ @royalparty_official #royalparty\nshirt❥︎ @grshimamura #しまむら購入品\nonlyone mask❥︎make by @flamboyantly.co \n.\n.\nマナーとオシャレの共存。それは、あなたと会うために。\n.\n.\n#model#撮影#被写体#作品撮り#ポートレートモデル#ポートレート#カジュアルコーデ#アラフォー#ハンドメイド#ハンドメイドマスク#ootd#coordinate#socialdistance\n#portrait_shot#portrait_ig\n#撮られたいわたしも#月刊8月のクリスマス#ポトレ撮影隊#東京カメラ部#ポトレのセカイ#dress_portrait#art_of_japan#portrait_club_jp#good_portraits_world#lovers_nippon_portrait","NumberOfLikes":208,"Hashtags":["#yurakucho","#uniqloginza2020fw","#エアリズムコットンリブブラタンクトップ","#royalparty","#しまむら購入品","#mode","#撮","#被写","#作品撮","#ポートレートモデ","#ポートレー","#カジュアルコーテ","#アラフォ","#ハンドメイト","#ハンドメイドマス","#oot","#coordinat","#socialdistance","#portrait_sho","#portrait_ig","#撮られたいわたし","#月刊8月のクリスマ","#ポトレ撮影","#東京カメラ","#ポトレのセカ","#dress_portrai","#art_of_japa","#portrait_club_j","#good_portraits_worl","#lovers_nippon_portrait"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1596595438,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 05 04:43:58 CEST 2020","Location":"有楽町ガード下"},{"Owner":"mynameiz_luca","CaptionText":"Working on a command (that I may already have known 😂) for walking position directly in front because many people in #downtown #winnipeg are not giving #servicedog teams the #socialdistance they need 2 bodies here people Woof!","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#downtown","#winnipeg","#servicedog","#socialdistance"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Luca Flyswatter on August 04, 2020.

Why? Because I wore my PPE (mask), they wore theirs, and we practiced social distancing.\n\nThere are ways to protect yourself and others and it starts by following simple guidelines in place to protect those around us. So, from now on if you see me out of the confines of my home, and we are within 6 feet of each other I will wear my mask for your safety.

To hear that as a nurse, struck a nerve because nurses, as part of the healthcare community, are expected to have answers and\/or know what to do if we don't. BUT it doesn't change the fact I still can't do, fix, or solve it all.\n\nNo matter how good my intentions, level of intelligence, amount of compassion, or desire to help change things in healthcare, there will always be something that is outside my realm of control. I need to remember that no matter how chaotic, frustrating, discouraging, or hopeless life seems, God is in control all things and to lean on Him at all times for strength, peace, and wisdom instead of trying to figure out or do things on my own.\n\nAlso, real change in healthcare cannot be done by myself. To think otherwise, is prideful and completely disregards the other members in the healthcare community. EVERY department is IMPORTANT and ESSENTIAL - RNs, NPs, PAs, MDs, RT, PT\/OT\/ST, phlebotomy\/lab, EVS, RD, research, public health, and etc. \n\nWe are each unique to what we bring to the world of healthcare and we need to make sure that our voices are heard, individually and collectively. Not only on social media, but at the workplace, our communities, professional organizations, and at all elections. \n\n#publichealthsaveslives #publichealthmatters #coronavirus #covid19 #wearamask #washyourhands #socialdistance  #registerednurse #thatnurselife #nursing #travelnurse #travelnursing #publichealth #proudtobeanurse #nurselife #healthcareworkers #essentialworkers #peopleoverprofit #coronavirusisstilloutthere #healthcareprofessional #doyourpart #thisispublichealth #publichealthisessential #godisincontrol #godisfaithful #godgivemestrength #theserenityprayer #godisgoodallthetime #allthetimegodisgood #thoughtoftheday","NumberOfLikes":77,"Hashtags":["#publichealthsaveslives","#publichealthmatters","#coronavirus","#covid19","#wearamask","#washyourhands","#socialdistance","#registerednurse","#thatnurselife","#nursing","#travelnurse","#travelnursing","#publichealth","#proudtobeanurse","#nurselife","#healthcareworkers","#essentialworkers","#peopleoverprofit","#coronavirusisstilloutthere","#healthcareprofessional","#doyourpart","#thisispublichealth","#publichealthisessential","#godisincontrol","#godisfaithful","#godgivemestrength","#theserenityprayer","#godisgoodallthetime","#allthetimegodisgood","#thoughtoftheday"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by S a m m i e on August 04, 2020.

Automatic doors so you don\u2019t need to touch the handle, people operating lifts so you don\u2019t have to press buttons, and probably even ditching away with the communal coffee machine for some other contact-less alternative. Workspaces will become more safety conscious, and more impersonal, with employees having dedicated agile and versatile cubicles to suit all their needs. @keith_melbourne envisioned how design intervention can create a new sort of stylish-yet-safe workplace with the Avion.\u2060⠀\n\u2060⠀\nThe Avion is a modular workspace setup that comes with a contemporary design with soft curves, chic furniture, and a modern color palette to help make the workspace look friendly and appealing. Designed to create visual comfort so you\u2019re more focused and relaxed at work, the cubicle systems isolate you and provide enough space to work out of, while still giving you enough of a window to step out and socialize from time to time\u2026 from a distance of course!\u2060⠀\n\u2060⠀\nDesigner: Keith Melbourne Studio\u2060⠀\n\u2060⠀\nVisit: www.mesmerized.it\u2060⠀\n\u2060⠀\nTag your friends who might like this😊\u2060⠀\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2060⠀\n✉ Email for business requests\u2060⠀\n🔔 Turn Posts Notifications ON, don't miss our content!\u2060⠀\n© Photo owners| DM for credits or remove\u2060⠀\n✔ Follow us on Facebook & Pinterest\u2060⠀\n📣 #MesmerizeD\u2060⠀\n\u2060⠀\n#product #productdesign #industrialdesign #innovation #moderndesign #designinspiration #designspiration #designporn #designideas #designlife #productdesigner #industrialdesigner #innovative #YankoDesign #designlovers #socialdistancing #socialdistancing2020 #socialdistance #workspace #workspacedesign #workspaces #modular","NumberOfLikes":1775,"Hashtags":["#MesmerizeD\u2060⠀","#product","#productdesign","#industrialdesign","#innovation","#moderndesign","#designinspiration","#designspiration","#designporn","#designideas","#designlife","#productdesigner","#industrialdesigner","#innovative","#YankoDesign","#designlovers","#socialdistancing","#socialdistancing2020","#socialdistance","#workspace","#workspacedesign","#workspaces","#modular"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1596465590,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 03 16:39:50 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"rclwow_teepublic","CaptionText":"The Social Distancing World Championship Belt\n.\n.\n.\n#socialdistancing #socialdistance #staysafe #staypositive #wewillgetthroughthis #rclwow #teepublic #tpartists #facemaskdesign","NumberOfLikes":1,"Hashtags":["#socialdistancing","#socialdistance","#staysafe","#staypositive","#wewillgetthroughthis","#rclwow","#teepublic","#tpartists","#facemaskdesign"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by RCLWOW design on Teepublic on August 03, 2020 tagging @teepublic, and @tpartists.

So we decided to resume our high peaks adventures. We hiked up Big Slide Mountain. This time we were prepared and brought microspikes and used them for the first time during icy patches.

During the week we had 4 work stations set up throughout the house and that\u2019s what we did.  The only time we left the house together during the visit was when we left to pick up groceries.  Like most things these days, parts of the visit felt very normal. Other parts felt really weird.  Last night at 1:00 am, 4 hours before they were due to depart, I realized we hadn\u2019t taken a picture together to document the visit in any way.  While we had played games, made meals, watched movies, drank wine - the feeling of documenting our visit wasn\u2019t present.  So I whipped out my phone and took this charmer (FYI, she is standing in a pair of platform shoes - I am not shrinking). Earlier in the week we had noted that depending on how things go in the world, this could be the last time we see each other this year - nothing is a given, anything is possible.  The reality of that hit hard this morning when I got up and they were gone.  Today the uncertainty weighs particularly hard.  I am so ready to effortlessly see people and plan trips.  To look to the future with more confidence of what it holds.  To not grieve a goodbye because who knows what else 2020 has in store.  Grateful for the time we had.
