You know what though? You aren\u2019t wearing them for you. You are wearing them out of respect for the health and safety of every single person around you. This isn\u2019t a political post. It\u2019s a human post because COVID doesn\u2019t care what side of politics you are on. Look...I get it, they are hot in general, especially in the summer, and they are a pain, uncomfortable, etc, but they are necessary if we ever want to have the world a normal and safe place again. I especially understand how uncomfortable they are because they actually cause me physical pain. When I had my accident last year, I had to have two plates and 12 screws put in above my mouth and I still suffer from extreme nerve damage. The plates among other things in my face cause pain 24\/7, but the level varies because of several different factors. Weather and extreme heat are big factors, and when I wear a mask, it intensifies any heat and humidity. It flat out sucks, but I do it because it\u2019s what I need to do for my friends, family, strangers...everyone. I know people who have lost the battle to COVID and I know too many people who have lost loved ones to this horrific pandemic. The heartbreak so many people have experienced this year breaks my heart, so if I have to deal with extra pain to help prevent further heartbreak, it\u2019s worth it to me.

Prima di tutto impostate la vostra voce per l\u2019assistente Google se non l\u2019avete ancora fatto, successivamente pronunciate la fatidica frase \u201COk Google\u201D e dopo qualche secondo l\u2019assistente si attiverà: a quel punto vi basterà dire \u201CChiama con Whatsapp\u201D ed il nome del contatto di cui avete bisogno. Se volete fare una videochiamata, invece, basterà dire \u201CFai una videochiamata Whatsapp\u201D ed in aggiunta sempre il nome del contatto che desiderate. Un consiglio dal sottoscritto, visto che tra svago e lavoro effettuo chiamate più frequentemente, potete anche associare i vostri contatti con dei nickname rendendo la procedura ancora più rapida.

Apparently we weren\u2019t the only ones who knew that because the queue to the rooftop was around the corner. \n\nWe were only in the country for a few days, so time was precious, but we took a chance. We stood in line, and luckily is moved quickly. We got a drink in hand and just made it in time to capture this shot! \n\nWhen given the option, always go for the sunset 🌅.

See you.\n\n続きはまた今度。でわまた。\n\nPS 追伸\n\nPlease be continuously careful not to catch the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, you all.\n\n引き続き新型コロナウィルス（COVID-19）感染に気をつけよう。\n\n🇯🇵Don't give up, Japan. 🇯🇵頑張れ日本！\n\n#Chiba-Pref. \n#Isumi-City \n#Chosei-District \n#Ichinomiya-Town \n#TaitoBeach \n#KujukuriBeach \n#PacificOcean \n#Sotobo \n#SocialDistance \n#Tanysurf \n#Surfing \n#SurfingTraining \n#Onshore \n#MiddleTide \n#千葉県いすみ市 \n#長生郡一宮町 \n#太東海岸 \n#九十九里浜 \n#太平洋 \n#外房 \n#ソーシャルディスタンス \n#タニーサーフ \n#サーフィン \n#サーフィン強化 \n#オンショア \n#中潮","NumberOfLikes":65,"Hashtags":["#Chiba-Pref.","#Isumi-City","#Chosei-District","#Ichinomiya-Town","#TaitoBeach","#KujukuriBeach","#PacificOcean","#Sotobo","#SocialDistance","#Tanysurf","#Surfing","#SurfingTraining","#Onshore","#MiddleTide","#千葉県いすみ市","#長生郡一宮町","#太東海岸","#九十九里浜","#太平洋","#外房","#ソーシャルディスタンス","#タニーサーフ","#サーフィン","#サーフィン強化","#オンショア","#中潮"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1596266049,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 01 09:14:09 CEST 2020","Location":"太東海岸"},{"CaptionText":"It's a new month!\n\nI don't believe how fast this year is going all things considered. 2020 - what an odd one!\n\nSo far it seems like it's going to carry on been weird too.

What makes London lashes stand out from the crowd, here\u2019s a few reasons: \n\n* \tLashes are oil-proof and instantly waterproof\n* \tThis unique technique allows lashes to look thick and full even as they shed\n* \tInfills are needed every 4-5 weeks (depending on growth cycle, age, medication and activity, infills might be needed every 3 weeks)\n* \tLondon Volume extensions are safe to wear even though the look is more full, dense, and dramatic than American Volume. This is due to the use of thinner diameter extensions, which create lighter fans.\n\nWith less weight than standard volume lashes, you get all of the drama without sacrificing that natural feel.

This is my first post, a #ghibiliredraw that I initially shared on my personal insta. \u201CPrincess MononoGwen\u201D was my first time using @autodesksketchbook on my iPad Mini 4 with the @53pencil . I wasn\u2019t completely confident in the app at the time, so I stuck to the basic pen and airbrush option set in the app. That said, despite not using the most up to date tech, I think its pretty good. Autodesk Sketchbook is a great FREE app. Maybe not as robust as Photoshop or Procreate, but I think its perfect for someone just kind of getting a feel for drawing digitally. Its a simple, friendly UI experience. Using the texture shapes on both the suit and the background really works bring it all together. I really like how vibrant it is despite there being so much black. All and all, now a bad way to go for my first go in a few years. Next week\u2019s illustration will certainly be a bit more topical, but You\u2019ll see a particular theme in most if these initial pieces very quickly. \n\nCheers!!\n\n#digitalart #appleipad #ipadmini4 #53pencil #autodesksketchbook #comicart #artstudy #kaiju #mecha #nsfw #greyscale #funtimes #covid19 #quarantine #wearamask #staysafe #socialdistance #everyfriday #hopefully #redraw #spiderman #spidergwen #hayaomiyazaki #princessmononoke #studioghibli #intothespiderversefanart #intothespiderverse #wassupdanger #procreate","NumberOfLikes":4,"Hashtags":["#ghibiliredraw","#digitalart","#appleipad","#ipadmini4","#53pencil","#autodesksketchbook","#comicart","#artstudy","#kaiju","#mecha","#nsfw","#greyscale","#funtimes","#covid19","#quarantine","#wearamask","#staysafe","#socialdistance","#everyfriday","#hopefully","#redraw","#spiderman","#spidergwen","#hayaomiyazaki","#princessmononoke","#studioghibli","#intothespiderversefanart","#intothespiderverse","#wassupdanger","#procreate"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1596218989,"LocalDate":"Fri Jul 31 20:09:49 CEST 2020","Location":"Quarantine Zone"},{"CaptionText":"🤍\n.\n.\n.\n#saublebeach #sunset #sunsetswim #sunsetphotography #silhouette #splash #soakingitin #grateful #getoutside #socialdistance #summer #swim #lake #lakehuron #lakelife #saublebeach #sunsetswim","NumberOfLikes":15,"Hashtags":["#saublebeach","#sunset","#sunsetswim","#sunsetphotography","#silhouette","#splash","#soakingitin","#grateful","#getoutside","#socialdistance","#summer","#swim","#lake","#lakehuron","#lakelife","#saublebeach","#sunsetswim"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Laura Good in Sauble Beach.

The conclusion is there is no evidence that the drug works plus it has significant side effects (heart damage)- link to study in bio\n\n.\n.\nShe claims that she and her fellow doctors have been using HCQ as prophylaxis with success and that masks are unnecessary. \n.\nThe fact:\nAgain there has been well conducted studies (above) disproving this. \n\n.\n.\nShe says an NIH study in 2005 prooved the effectiveness of HCQ (link to article on bio) and also claims the NIH knows that HCQ works, quoting a Covid-19-hiccups study. \n.\nThe Fact:\nThe 2005 study looked at HCQ effectiveness on viruses but not Covid-19 as it did not exist at that time. \nThe hiccup study was based on one patient in China with Covid-19 who presented with hiccups and HCQ cured the hiccups - link in bio\n.\n.\nShe is a pediatrician who claims to be treating adults and says that masks don\u2019t work.

Bake the cake according to the instructions on the package. Let cool for 30 minutes or more. ⠀\n2. Here\u2019s the fun part, SMASH that cake! Break it up until it\u2019s mostly crumbs.⠀\n3. Add in some icing, a little at a time until everything starts sticking together. You don\u2019t want to overload it with icing or your cake balls will be way too sweet and these things are already sure to give your little one a sugar rush. 🤪 ⠀\n4. Roll the dough into small balls and put on a baking sheet.⠀\n5. Put them in the freezer for about 30 mins so they are more durable.⠀\n6. Melt your chocolate over very low heat being careful not to burn it. I stir continuously and then take it off of the burner for a few seconds continue stirring and keep repeating until it\u2019s all melted. Also be sure not to get any water in your chocolate as it will ruin the consistency and will become unusable. You can add a little gel food coloring at this stage if you wish. ⠀\n7. Dip your cake balls into the melted chocolate and coat evenly. ⠀\n8. Place onto foil or parchment paper then top with sprinkles if you wish!⠀\n9. Put them all back in the refrigerator - they will harden quickly.⠀\n10.
