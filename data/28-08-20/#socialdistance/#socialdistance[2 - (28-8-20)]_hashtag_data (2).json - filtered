It is not inherited. And oftentimes, greatness isn't appreciated or recognised until you see greatness anywhere no more\u2063.\n\u2063\n🤫The secret of greatness lies within you. There is no discrimination from God. Anybody can be great. You have the formula of greatness inside you. It depends on you if you want to be great. If you want to be great, you can be great.\u2063\n\u2063\nThat secret recipe of greatness is inside you. There are so many souls inside you. Nothing is out of your reach. When you reach God, you will be at the pinnacle of your journey. That is the culmination.\u2063\n\u2063\nGreatness is not inherited.\u2063\n\u2063\n👨\u200D✈️ If your father is a pilot, do you assume you will be a pilot all by yourself, without any training or education? If your father is a great batsman, do you think you'll be a great batsman without making any effort? Why then do people think that if the father is a saint of God, then the son or daughter will be a saint of God too?\u2063\n\u2063\n❤️You will be a saint of God if God wants you to be his friend. It depends on God and you. Your family is not involved; the decision is taken by God. If God is willing, he will accept you as a friend. \u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n#ALRATV #GoharShahi #YounusAlGohar #sufi #sufism #agapelove #saint #fate #divinelove #lovequotes #divine #purification #compassion #greatness #selfesteem #selfimprovement #creation #Nirvana #higherself #theself #happiness #motivation #UniversalSufi #hope #socialdistance #hope #strength #positiveenergy #enlightenment #evolve","NumberOfLikes":1,"Hashtags":["#Repost","#ALRATV","#GoharShahi","#YounusAlGohar","#sufi","#sufism","#agapelove","#saint","#fate","#divinelove","#lovequotes","#divine","#purification","#compassion","#greatness","#selfesteem","#selfimprovement","#creation","#Nirvana","#higherself","#theself","#happiness","#motivation","#UniversalSufi","#hope","#socialdistance","#hope","#strength","#positiveenergy","#enlightenment","#evolve"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Jon Snow on August 25, 2020.

People - PLEASE, PLEASE listen to experts and believe that the Corona Virus exists and wearing a mask can help save lives and prevent the after affects of its wrath on your body after being exposed. This here is my youngest son, who tested positive for the Virus back in June. He had fever, bad body aches, headaches, lost of smell and taste. He had symptoms close to 4 weeks before getting a negative test result. Although he thought he recovered, but the side effects are continuous - low energy, what seems to be nerve damage and now his lung has collapsed possibly due to damage by the Virus! 😭😭 He will be ok and was fortunate that he was able to get to the hospital on time to be treated immediately 🙏. So, before you get restless about our lives as it is happening now, the closures of stores, the having to wear masks, the constant washing of your hands, being told not to be in large groups, no large family gatherings etc, think about something like this and how it can permanently change your life or worse yet, someone you love can lose theirs out of YOUR irresponsibility! Because of this Virus, I am not allowed to be with him and he is alone having to experience this 😭😭😡. For those who think it can't happen to you, it can!

And this post is going to be very personal( kinda journal entry🙈) \n.\nWhy I took a break?\nSuddenly last week I noticed that I was getting too addicted to Instagram and I couldn\u2019t stop refreshing the page again and again to see what\u2019s new happening there. Stalking some random pages, getting excited when people uploaded something new. And after that I started worrying about my social performance. Self-criticism hit hard on me. That was really really not healthy for me(for you also) \nAlways remember that a part of social media is not real. \nThen I realised that I needed a break from all this. I went a step ahead to delete the app( now understand the level of addiction!😂)\nIn these five days, I did all the things to ease my mind and body. I challenge myself to do all the things without posting it as insta stories 😂🙈\nReading novels, listening to podcasts, \nReading about young entrepreneurs , Writing journals, listening to music, I even noticed my water intake 😂 \n.\n.\nWhy I\u2019m saying all these here is, you should manage your insta acc and don\u2019t let the insta acc to manage you...\nWhenever you feel like taking a break, plz do take!! (Don\u2019t worry about the followers count)\nBreak is necessary! Don\u2019t get overwhelmed by social media. \nThis is not real. \nRefreshing the computer(human body) is very very essential for a good run ♥️\n.\n.\n.\nMental health matters more than social media engagements. \n.\n.\n.\nStay safe♥️\n.\n.\n.\n#mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #mentalillness #socialmedia #socialdistance #socialmediadetox #socialmediadetoxing #creators #bloggerslife #chennaiinfluencer #chennaifashionblogger #chennaifashionbloggers #chennaiblogger #coimbatoreblogger #coimbatorefashionblogger #southindianblogger #southindian #staysafe","NumberOfLikes":175,"Hashtags":["#mentalhealth","#mentalhealthawareness","#mentalillness","#socialmedia","#socialdistance","#socialmediadetox","#socialmediadetoxing","#creators","#bloggerslife","#chennaiinfluencer","#chennaifashionblogger","#chennaifashionbloggers","#chennaiblogger","#coimbatoreblogger","#coimbatorefashionblogger","#southindianblogger","#southindian","#staysafe"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by 𝒀𝒖𝒗𝒂𝒔𝒓𝒊 𝑺𝒓𝒊𝒏𝒊𝒗𝒂𝒔𝒂𝒏 ✨ on August 24, 2020.

Saturday night, my sister rented out a movie theater so we could watch Harry Potter & the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone, alone. (It wasn\u2019t too pricey at all, by the way!) Seriously, it was just my husband, my sister, & myself. We watched a movie we\u2019ve seen a hundred times. We were by ourselves. We ate popcorn & drank soda that were unnecessarily expensive. It felt like I got some normalcy back, except for the mask-wearing, frequent washing of the hands, hand-sanitizing, remaining six-feet away from people I wasn\u2019t usually with, & legit flushing the public restroom toilet with my shoe (because I was not about to touch that nastiness with my hand). I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t have at least a few anxiety attacks as we pulled into the parking lot or while we made our way through the main lobby of the theater, but it felt good to get out a bit. Now, we\u2019re headed back to our home in New York, four hours away, where I\u2019ll remain until Rosh Hashana (the Jewish New Year) gets here.

Dat kan alleen als mensen zich laagdrempelig laten testen. Dan kunnen mensen die besmet zijn met het virus zo snel mogelijk in quarantaine en verspreiden zij het virus niet verder. Weet u nog de vergelijking met het verkeer? Een van de belangrijkste maatregelen om verspreiding en een nieuwe uitbraak te voorkomen is snelle signalering en aanpak, als uw remmen het niet doen dan gaat u ook naar de garage om het te laten testen. En\u2026 ik zeg het nog maar een keer: het coronavirus kan ook mild verlopen! \n \nEr zijn veel vragen over testen \u2013 hoe goed is de PCR test eigenlijk? Dit is de test die door de GGD wordt gebruikt door materiaal achter uit de keel en de neus af te nemen. Het korte antwoord is dat deze test, zoals gedaan in de officiële laboratoria goed, het nieuwe coronavirus kan aantonen. Het gaat dan dus om dit coronavirus en niet om de andere coronavirussen die er al waren. Overigens meet deze test je wel OF je het nieuwe coronavirus hebt, maar deze test zegt niets over HOE BESMETTELIJK je bent. Niet 1 test is waterdicht, soms is de test negatief (geen coronavirus) terwijl er wel duidelijk klachten zijn. Ook dan is het belangrijk om gezond verstand te blijven gebruiken, misschien heb je het toch.

Considering that my current plan started while recovering from a fractured toe, I can say that I\u2019ve seen results! Today I logged 13.1 miles and I enjoyed an easy pace that is helping me to build the aerobic base I need for a bigger goal that I set for 2021! In the meantime, the virtual @nycmarathon is still on schedule and I am on track to achieve my 1K miles this 2020... Running has not been canceled but please, practice social distance and stay healthy! What have you been up to? 🇻🇪 Que dicen los panas? 💪🏼 Han pasado 5 semanas desde que comencé un plan para recuperar la forma física y todo ha sido bien agradable! Tomando en cuenta que lo comencé mientras me recuperaba de un dedo fracturado en el pie, puedo decir que he visto resultados. Hoy corrí 21 Kms a paso suave y me está ayudando a preparar la base aeróbica que necesito para otra meta más grande que tengo para el 2021. Mientras tanto, el maratón virtual @nycmarathon sigue en la mira al igual que la meta de las 1000 millas recorridas en este 2020. Correr no está cancelado, pero practiquen el distanciamiento social y manténganse sanos!

Thank you for allowing us to be a part of your special day.\n\nSee more photos in our story highlights✨\n\n#Love #StillHere #Wedding #Reception #Small #IntimateWedding #SocialDistance #HandSanitizer #CovidCannotStopLove #EthiopianFoodTruck #ThankYou","NumberOfLikes":78,"Hashtags":["#Love","#StillHere","#Wedding","#Reception","#Small","#IntimateWedding","#SocialDistance","#HandSanitizer","#CovidCannotStopLove","#EthiopianFoodTruck","#ThankYou"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1598195335,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 17:08:55 CEST 2020","Location":"Whittier Cafe"},{"Owner":"catiahowell","CaptionText":"Time is not refundable, use it wisely 🙄, 2 days to go and I'm out of this quarantine 🤦\u200D♀️!\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#covid #covid_19 #coronavírus #coronavirus #covid19 #quarantine #quarentine2020 #quarantinelife #quarantineandchill #quarantinemood #quarantined #isolation #isolamentosocial #bored #positivemindset #positiveenergy #positivemind #positivethinking #positivevibes #herewegoagain #staysafe #socialdistance #time","NumberOfLikes":125,"Hashtags":["#covid","#covid_19","#coronavírus","#coronavirus","#covid19","#quarantine","#quarentine2020","#quarantinelife","#quarantineandchill","#quarantinemood","#quarantined","#isolation","#isolamentosocial","#bored","#positivemindset","#positiveenergy","#positivemind","#positivethinking","#positivevibes","#herewegoagain","#staysafe","#socialdistance","#time"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Cátia Guerreiro in Kingston upon Hull.

It has some very unique sourness and matched well with the umami of the caviar. A very balanced and nicely executed pasta👍🏼 The pâté en croûte is the extra dish I order on top of the set menu as I just miss this hearty and homey piece too much🥺The sourdough with signature spread, choux pastry and canelé are perfect as always that I consistantly want them to open a pastry🍞 stall so that I do not always have to look out for my breakfast ☀️\n\nLastly, I would like to thank MO for the most on-point service and the amazing valet for the delivery.

This 'walk' was only 6km but my goodness it was impressive. I'd noted some waterfalls marked on a map opposite a popular walking spot, so I looked for an appropriate track to see if I could get in and have a look. Well, I found the track and bashed my way in (it was petty overgrown) and got the chance to walk up alongside this amazing river. \n\nThis is Little River (one of 3 Little Rivers I know of in Victoria). The river has a funny sort of path. It travels in a shallow valley about 1,000m above sea level and then turn left. As it turns it progressively drops around 500m over a distance of maybe 5km. In the middle of winter the tall hills and mountains east of Melbourne capture storms and showers and then funnels them into fast moving rivers. During the wetter months the racing white water puts on a dramatic show of force.\n\n#igaustralia #hikeon  #explorethemountains #hikerforlife #trailhiking #trailhikingaust #victoriawalks #bushwalkingvictoria #isolation #socialdistance #parksvictoria #cathedralranges #taungurungcountry #cathedralrangesstatepark #discoverdindi","NumberOfLikes":118,"Hashtags":["#igaustralia","#hikeon","#explorethemountains","#hikerforlife","#trailhiking","#trailhikingaust","#victoriawalks","#bushwalkingvictoria","#isolation","#socialdistance","#parksvictoria","#cathedralranges","#taungurungcountry","#cathedralrangesstatepark","#discoverdindi"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Deano the Weekend Wanderer in Cathedral Range State Park.
