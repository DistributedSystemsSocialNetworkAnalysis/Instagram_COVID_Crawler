It is not inherited. And oftentimes, greatness isn't appreciated or recognised until you see greatness anywhere no more\u2063.\n\u2063\n🤫The secret of greatness lies within you. There is no discrimination from God. Anybody can be great. You have the formula of greatness inside you. It depends on you if you want to be great. If you want to be great, you can be great.\u2063\n\u2063\nThat secret recipe of greatness is inside you. There are so many souls inside you. Nothing is out of your reach. When you reach God, you will be at the pinnacle of your journey. That is the culmination.\u2063\n\u2063\nGreatness is not inherited.\u2063\n\u2063\n👨\u200D✈️ If your father is a pilot, do you assume you will be a pilot all by yourself, without any training or education? If your father is a great batsman, do you think you'll be a great batsman without making any effort? Why then do people think that if the father is a saint of God, then the son or daughter will be a saint of God too?\u2063\n\u2063\n❤️You will be a saint of God if God wants you to be his friend. It depends on God and you. Your family is not involved; the decision is taken by God. If God is willing, he will accept you as a friend. \u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n#ALRATV #GoharShahi #YounusAlGohar #sufi #sufism #agapelove #saint #fate #divinelove #lovequotes #divine #purification #compassion #greatness #selfesteem #selfimprovement #creation #Nirvana #higherself #theself #happiness #motivation #UniversalSufi #hope #socialdistance #hope #strength #positiveenergy #enlightenment #evolve","NumberOfLikes":44,"Hashtags":["#ALRATV","#GoharShahi","#YounusAlGohar","#sufi","#sufism","#agapelove","#saint","#fate","#divinelove","#lovequotes","#divine","#purification","#compassion","#greatness","#selfesteem","#selfimprovement","#creation","#Nirvana","#higherself","#theself","#happiness","#motivation","#UniversalSufi","#hope","#socialdistance","#hope","#strength","#positiveenergy","#enlightenment","#evolve"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Bilal Qasim on August 24, 2020.

I'd like to say I've had worse houseguests, but that would be a stretch. There are some lessons to be shared:\n\nFirst, continue all the efforts you are already taking to maintain social distancing, practice thorough and frequent hand-washing, and get adequate rest. Wear a mask if out in shared public spaces.\n\nSecondly, if you or a family member develop symptoms that are suspicious (fever, cough, headache or extreme fatigue and muscle aches), or believe you have been exposed to the coronavirus, don't panic, call the Ministry of Health\n\nThirdly, if you or a family member is diagnosed, you are certainly allowed to feel frightened, and it is also necessary to do a reality check. This is a scary illness, and most people are able to get through it at home with support and guidance from health professionals. The symptoms are no picnic, but in most cases can be managed at home with simple measures and supportive care from the healthcare system.\nWe've all had the flu, or at least most of us have. What makes COVID-19 different is it lingers longer, and the symptoms come and go in unpredictable ways. A good day can be followed by a bad day, followed by something in between.

People - PLEASE, PLEASE listen to experts and believe that the Corona Virus exists and wearing a mask can help save lives and prevent the after affects of its wrath on your body after being exposed. This here is my youngest son, who tested positive for the Virus back in June. He had fever, bad body aches, headaches, lost of smell and taste. He had symptoms close to 4 weeks before getting a negative test result. Although he thought he recovered, but the side effects are continuous - low energy, what seems to be nerve damage and now his lung has collapsed possibly due to damage by the Virus! 😭😭 He will be ok and was fortunate that he was able to get to the hospital on time to be treated immediately 🙏. So, before you get restless about our lives as it is happening now, the closures of stores, the having to wear masks, the constant washing of your hands, being told not to be in large groups, no large family gatherings etc, think about something like this and how it can permanently change your life or worse yet, someone you love can lose theirs out of YOUR irresponsibility!

While this is not ALWAYS the best choice (👋sunk cost fallacy!) it is often a teaching\/learning tool that builds character.\n\nIn February, the kids got involved with the PCHS production of the Broadway musical: Matilda. Then #coronapocalypse struck and they started doing rehearsals through zoom. Then zoom got hacked and they moved rehearsals to google. Then there were the technical challenges associated with online music collaboration. Then after 5? months of rehearsals, the show got canceled and a social distancing drive in solo performance weekend got scheduled. Then Virginia was flooded and the event was moved indoors on the day of the show. Then there were technical issues because of the storm. To name a FEW hurdles! \n\nDespite a MOUNTAIN of setbacks, the audience came and sat 6-10\u2019 apart and the show went on! I cannot praise Jeff McCoy and his PCHS Players enough. They smiled. They laughed. They sang. They had great attitudes. They performed. They taught my kids (and me!) much about what it means to \u201Cfinish what you started.\u201D And while it\u2019s not what they set out to learn in the beginning, they learned SO MUCH.

As many of you are aware, I hadn\u2019t left my house (apart from the occasional car ride to nowhere & one road trip to see the same two people I\u2019ve been seeing since June \u2014 my mom & sister) in six months. Saturday night, my sister rented out a movie theater so we could watch Harry Potter & the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone, alone. (It wasn\u2019t too pricey at all, by the way!) Seriously, it was just my husband, my sister, & myself. We watched a movie we\u2019ve seen a hundred times. We were by ourselves. We ate popcorn & drank soda that were unnecessarily expensive. It felt like I got some normalcy back, except for the mask-wearing, frequent washing of the hands, hand-sanitizing, remaining six-feet away from people I wasn\u2019t usually with, & legit flushing the public restroom toilet with my shoe (because I was not about to touch that nastiness with my hand). I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t have at least a few anxiety attacks as we pulled into the parking lot or while we made our way through the main lobby of the theater, but it felt good to get out a bit. Now, we\u2019re headed back to our home in New York, four hours away, where I\u2019ll remain until Rosh Hashana (the Jewish New Year) gets here.

Those six weeks should also facilitate a better understanding of how #covid affects us in schools.\n\nI hope to offer aerial and #circus #workshops, #classes, and #training from November.

The past months acquired habits need to be forgotten and the new time-reality kicks back in. Commuting will involve time, the new work day will require close planning, true time management returns.\n It is incredible how much creatures of habits we are, but it is also incredible how adaptable we can be to circumstances.

The quality of food is definitely on par with dine-in. The roasted local yellow chicken 🐔is still my No. 1 in Hong Kong🥇(if you know what I refer to 🤫) The meat is tender and succulent that you can never resist to while the Niigata rice \u2018en cocotte\u2019 is perfect in every aspect: the chewiness texture with crispy chicken skin just bring me to heaven😇\n\nThe black truffle angel hair with Kristal caviar is cooked in kombu sauce. It has some very unique sourness and matched well with the umami of the caviar. A very balanced and nicely executed pasta👍🏼 The pâté en croûte is the extra dish I order on top of the set menu as I just miss this hearty and homey piece too much🥺The sourdough with signature spread, choux pastry and canelé are perfect as always that I consistantly want them to open a pastry🍞 stall so that I do not always have to look out for my breakfast ☀️\n\nLastly, I would like to thank MO for the most on-point service and the amazing valet for the delivery. It is truly a 5-star experience.

The one thing that I have enjoyed about our current reality is being able to drop into several different yoga studios via Zoom. My current rotation is @mettamovesme, @samudrastudioyoga and @presence_of_mind_maine. For the first time in years, I've gotten back into a solid practice routine. In some ways, our need to #socialdistance allows for greater accessibility. I hope that is something that remains, whenever we move beyond the #pandemic.\n\nAfter class, I did some deep cleaning while listening to music. Saturday morning cleaning with music is what I grew up with and it's grounding. Afterwards, I light incense and it takes me back to my childhood.\n\n While I don't like to cook, I actually don't mind cleaning. I hate clutter and it feels so good to shower up after cleaning and just sit in the stillness of a clean house. \n\nA few minutes ago, I went out to check the tomatoes and they are coming along. I suspect I'll roast them and turn them into a sauce. Though a few fried green tomatoes would be lovely. \n\nIt's a lazy, late summer day. It almost feels normal. I guess we can create moments of normal even in the chaos. These normal moments are what keep me grounded and rooted to my truth and my own humanity. \n\nMay your day be blessed with moments of normal. #coviving #pandemicmusings #coronavirusdiarys #anewnormal #survivingduringcorona #createthelifeyouwant #home #midlifetransition #dailyreflections #dailyrythm #maineislandlife #growfood #homegarden #bgimchronicles","NumberOfLikes":474,"Hashtags":["#lifeduringapandemic","#ashtangayoga","#socialdistance","#pandemic.","#coviving","#pandemicmusings","#coronavirusdiarys","#anewnormal","#survivingduringcorona","#createthelifeyouwant","#home","#midlifetransition","#dailyreflections","#dailyrythm","#maineislandlife","#growfood","#homegarden","#bgimchronicles"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":9,"Timestamp":1598133841,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 00:04:01 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"garysplayground","CaptionText":"INTRODUCING WILLIAM (Will) VIRIATO!!

The first Atlanta Food & Film Fridays with Ashlee. 😛🤩\n.\nLast night, I picked up from one of my faves Beetlecat ; however, my new self discipline was in full force and I did not get the coconut creme pie. It was hard. I did however get the tuna tartare that has made its way back on the menu. Honestly, very few things are as good take out as in the restaurant; but in general their tuna tartare is one of my faves, and I think it\u2019s the sesame crackers that make it. They did not disappoint. I also got the ginger salad, and I think it\u2019s my favorite ginger salad dressing. I had left overs from the salad that I will eat with dinner tonight. Easy to grab curbside, at their outdoor walk up bar around back by the Den entrance. I paid over the phone, so it was grab and go. \n\nBefore grabbing my curbside take out, I popped into Vinoteca and asked for a dry Sauvignon blanc for under $20 and within 30 seconds, I had one in my hand. It\u2019s by Yllera and is from the Rueda region of Spain. Pretty good. P.S. you aren\u2019t allowed past the entryway.  They go and pull what you ask for, which is honestly easier with a pup in tow. They also had live music on their patio out front, which was really nice. They have tables set up outside if you want to partake in their wine tasting, which I know from personal experience are generous pours. 😬\n\nAnd for the film, drumroll please... it was The Little Tin Man which I\u2019ve been meaning to watch for the longest time, because my friend Aaron Beelner is the lead!! It\u2019s an indie flick, not filmed here, but Aaron is a local Atlanta actor. It was very charming and sweet, as well funny. It tells the story of Herman, a man with dwarfism, who wants people to see past his little stature and take him seriously as a man and actor. Bonus, Michael McGlone from  Brothers McMullen, Jeff Hiller who is freaking hilarious and Kay Cannon who wrote all three of the Pitch Perfect movies .  It was a band of misfits led by Aaron and I loved it! You can rent it for a few dollars on Vimeo. \n\nIf you have suggestions for next Friday, where once again I will drink too much wine by myself on my sofa, hit me up!","NumberOfLikes":48,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":13,"Timestamp":1598123305,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 21:08:25 CEST 2020","Location":"Inman Park"},{"Owner":"coron_line","CaptionText":"#corona #socialdistancing #anderhalvemeterafstand #covid19 #Wageningen #lockdown2020 #socialdistance #anderhalvemetersamenleving #staysafe #stayhome #toilet #coron_line","NumberOfLikes":0,"Hashtags":["#corona","#socialdistancing","#anderhalvemeterafstand","#covid19","#Wageningen","#lockdown2020","#socialdistance","#anderhalvemetersamenleving","#staysafe","#stayhome","#toilet","#coron_line"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @coron_line on August 22, 2020.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598122991,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 21:03:11 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"colbyccollege","CaptionText":"You made it through the first week of classes! #WelcomeBack celebrate this victory by playing Rock\/Paper\/Scissors and eating some ice cream!

We value the time to be with our students, and views this summer as a meaningful one.

The measure of an individual, or organization, is how one responds to adversity. I believe we have all responded well and is a credit to each individual. 2020 has presented, and will continue to present, challenges but also opportunities. Greater opportunities for online courses. Greater opportunities for long distance learning. Greater opportunities to learn more computer skills. And, perhaps, greater opportunities to spend more time with family. \u2060\nAs long as each of us continues to respond to these ongoing challenges in a similar manner to what we have so far, I believe we will all look back on this year as one of the most memorable years of our lives. If that is the case, and it likely is, then we should continue to strive to have those memories as ones of success in conquering challenges, memorable self-reflection for when future hardships arise in years and decades to come, and the importance of friends, family, and colleagues in helping each other overcome difficulty.\u2060\n\u2060\nThank you all again for coming together and rising to the challenge and making this summer session a great success. I, and the rest of the G-MEO team, look forward to hopefully having many of you in our Fall 2020 classes as well.\"\u2060\n\u2060\n-- Dr. Andy Guth, American University\u2060\n\u2060\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\u2060\n\u2060\n#summer2020 #onlineclass #gmeosummer #college #studyonline #summerstudy #summerplan #summerlife #collegemust #studyinus #summeronline #studyathome  #socialdistance #professor #teachingabroad #teachinginchina #teachinchina #faculty #americanuniversity #university #summerreview\u2060","NumberOfLikes":11,"Hashtags":["#summer2020","#onlineclass","#gmeosummer","#college","#studyonline","#summerstudy","#summerplan","#summerlife","#collegemust","#studyinus","#summeronline","#studyathome","#socialdistance","#professor","#teachingabroad","#teachinginchina","#teachinchina","#faculty","#americanuniversity","#university","#summerreview\u2060"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by G-MEO | Study & Intern Abroad on August 22, 2020.
