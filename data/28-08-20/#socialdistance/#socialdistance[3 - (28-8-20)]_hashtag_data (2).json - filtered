One path may be to have a finance degree and excel in that career. That path may be walking the coastline in Italy while the beauty of a new language rattles around in your head. \n\nOne path may be to revel in art in your own hometown. In LaDonnaFoto's case, it may be all three paths! We at LaDonnaFoto believe life isn't one straight line, and things aren't black and white and cut and dry. LaDonnaFoto has attempted to capture the complexities of life through their landscape photography. While there are always constants in life, like the constants in the photos of water and sunshine, there is so much variety as well. And, just like when the water may be hard to spot in LaDonnaFoto's photos, consistency in life can be hard to spot. A lot of us are on an unprecedented and unique path right now and as much as we wish things were black and white, there's a lot of gray, and blue, and gold! We feel it's important to transport yourself when you are faced with a new path in life, this can help provide a new perspective and help you find your own constants, and you can do so by enjoying the landscape photography at LaDonnaFoto's studio @sawyeryards. A lot of us are facing a temporary path right now, but a temporary one that will remain imprinted on our hearts and minds for years to come. While we are going through this temporary journey together, let's remember to be kind, be safe, and be healthy, as those are some of the most important things we can focus on. \n\nWhether our constants in our world are dark black and gloomy grey, or beautiful blue and gleefully gold, we will get through this together. \n\n #LaDonnaFoto #artinhouston #houarts #beautifulitaly #italiagram #italiantravel #naturefotography #Socialdistance #SocialdistanceHouston #italy_creative_pictures #houstonartist #holidaysinitaly","NumberOfLikes":18,"Hashtags":["#LaDonnaFoto","#artinhouston","#houarts","#beautifulitaly","#italiagram","#italiantravel","#naturefotography","#Socialdistance","#SocialdistanceHouston","#italy_creative_pictures","#houstonartist","#holidaysinitaly"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1598048135,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 00:15:35 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"air_andy","CaptionText":"Poker.

Even though there is a mask mandate in most states, we can all understand and relate to the fact that it can be hard to supervise children in a school setting. Portable Acrylic Desk Shields are one preventative solution that schools have been using to possibly curb mass infection rates in schools.\n🦠 🦠 🦠 \nThe installation of physical barriers is a recommendation made by the CDC to prevent direct contact amongst people. These barriers have made their way to retail stores, offices, and restaurants. Installing clear physical barriers in schools preserve communication between students and teachers and keeps collaboration amongst students in-tact.\n👩\u200D🎓🧑\u200D🎓👨\u200D🎓\nEven though many schools are providing parents & students with virtual learning options, in-person learning has a significant effect on children. It helps build communication skills, makes education interactive, boosts creativity and helps students in problem solving.\n😷 😷 😷 \nThe protection of our children is highly important. The mortality rate and severity of COVID-19 is not high amongst children, but that does not mean that they don\u2019t become carriers of the disease. A lot of children spend time with their grandparents and parents who might be older, which are at higher risk. That\u2019s precisely why children too, need to be protected from being exposed to COVID-19.\n👨\u200D👩\u200D👦\u200D👦👩\u200D👩\u200D👦\u200D👦👨\u200D👩\u200D👧\u200D👧👩\u200D👩\u200D👧\u200D👧\nIf you are still looking for sneeze guards for schools, we can help you.

However, we see this as a real opportunity for innovation during this crazy year!\n\n** TICKET HOLDERS FROM MARCH WILL, OF COURSE, BE HONORED.

I knew I had put on a lot of weight at the time but I'd no idea just how bloated I'd got.\n\nI've looked back at lots of different pictures of myself through the years and the theme is consistent. Drinking a lot of beer makes me bloated. And it can be so gradual that you may not even realise just how bloated you may have got. All those empty calories go to the places where it's hard to hide. For me it goes to my face and to my chest worst of all.\n\nIt's important to remind myself of just how  miserable I was, looking the way I looked only 8 months ago. I know a lot of people will say that it doesn't matter how you look. But it does. It does to me anyway and I want to be the best version of me. I know I'm happier when I'm not overweight (or obese by national guidlines). My confidence is higher, my clothes fit, I can smile at myself in the mirror, I can walk with my shoulders back and back upright. \n\nI see myself putting on a few kg's again recently but that's ok. Life has been a bit hectic recently. But, I know I'm not going back to that place ever again, I love this new me too much and exercise is a staple of my life. The diet is taking much of my focus now as exercise is something I just do without any push now. But I still need to remind myself how easy it can be to slip back into old habits. You need to use your pain and struggle to get better. Everyone has to start somewhere on their journey. Once I'm qualified as a PT later this year, I want to help people lose weight the right way but more importantly make them feel better about themselves. You just got to keep trying. Don't worry about the failures. Focus on getting back up again.","NumberOfLikes":70,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Shane Goggin - Laoch on August 21, 2020.

The double patty beyond burger came with mustard, pickles, ketchup, and cheese then on the side they had onion, tomato, and lettuce. The tots were crispy which is how I like them. It came in the Bayside Tigers logo box with two commemorative gifts a pencil and two stickers. Photo ops were a lot less extravagant than a couple years ago when they were able to host a dine in Saved by the Bell experience. So it was understandable since they were following safety guidelines. I felt very safe and social distancing was followed. One bummer was we ordered two meals but only got one box and one gift set. It seems like if we are paying for two experience we should have gotten two sets of gifts. \n\nI believe there are still open slots online to reserve your pick up time. I suggest if going with others each do your own order so you each get the gifts. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t do another pop up pick up experience again just because it was a bit pricey for what is offered and I know how amazing the dine in experience is. But I would do a dine in experience again once it is safe to do so because the food is really good and they have lots of photo ops and memorabilia. \n\n#savedbythemax #savedbythebell #bayside #la #hollywood #beldingapproved #beyond #beyondmeat #tigers #iamsoexcited #tots #popup #socialdistance #food #burgers #gobayside #preppy #nationalsavedbythebellday","NumberOfLikes":15,"Hashtags":["#savedbythemax","#savedbythebell","#bayside","#la","#hollywood","#beldingapproved","#beyond","#beyondmeat","#tigers","#iamsoexcited","#tots","#popup","#socialdistance","#food","#burgers","#gobayside","#preppy","#nationalsavedbythebellday"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597973240,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 03:27:20 CEST 2020","Location":"West Hollywood Gateway"},{"Owner":"social.distance.apparel","CaptionText":"We want to know more about you!

Carillon Kitchen is nestled at Carillon Point, which was once a hub for shipbuilding and is now a beautiful marina. During the day, the carillon bells just outside our restaurant chime softly every hour, as a reminder of the area\u2019s history and as a beacon for pleasure boats cruising Lake Washington.

Jucer su me odbili jer mi jos najblizi kontakt nije imao pozitivan test (koji je dobiven sinoc oko 20h). Danas su me konacno narucili za testiranje 21.8. u 10:35. Iako \"simptome\" imam vec 3 dana i najblizi kontakt je kontaktirao svoju doktoricu prije 3 dana meni jos uvijek, do dana danasnjeg nije odredjena mjera samoizolacije sto znaci da sam malo blentaviji i neodgovorniji mogao sam zaraziti u tih par dana jos tko zna koliko ljudi jer sluzbeno nisam bio u samoizolaciji sve do danas. Danas mi je konacno određena samoizolacija do 3.9. Jucer je broj zarazenih u Hrvatskoj bio 200 i nesto, taj broj je smijesan, to nema ama bas nikakve veze s realnoscu. Na svakog pozitivnog dolazi bez pretjerivanja 10-20 onih koji se jednostavno ne zele testirati ili uopce nemaju simptome. Prije nekoliko mjeseci bili smo zatvoreni 2 mjeseca u kuce da se zaraza nebi slobodno sirila, a sada se slobodno siri i vise nemoguce ju je zaustaviti. Onih 5-10% zarazenih koji se testiraju ce platiti ceh za sve ostale i biti zatvoreni u kuce bez mogucnosti da rade, zarađuju, ostvaruju ikakve socijalne kontakte, a na svakog potvrđenog zarazenog na slobodi ce biti 10-20 onih koji niti nisu testirani. Vjerovati da se ovu situaciju drzi pod kontrolom je suludo, ne jer je netko nesposoban drzati ju, nego sto je doslovno nemoguce zaustaviti taj virus da se siri. Sto se tice tezine simptoma koje imam danas - nemam ih, smrcanje se u potpunosti smanjilo, temperatura mi varira između 36.4 i 37, jedino sto sam primjetio je da otkad imam COVID-19 sam se naspavao kao nikada u zivotu. Također svi ostali zarazeni koje znam, potvrdjeni ili nepotvrdjeni nemaju nikakve simptome, a osoba koja ima najteze simptome sama kaze da se nebi obazirala na njih da ne zna da se radi o Koronavirusu, a vjerujte mi da uzorak o kojem govorim nije mali...\n\nP. S. Nekoliko ljudi minje reklo da postoje sanse da mi se ugasi IG profil ako budem pisao ovakve stvari, ali nadam se da jos uvijek Hrvatska nije postala Sjeverna Koreja da ne smijemo iznesti vlastito iskustvo na svojim profilima.","NumberOfLikes":1273,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Kristijan Matković in Zagreb, Croatia.
