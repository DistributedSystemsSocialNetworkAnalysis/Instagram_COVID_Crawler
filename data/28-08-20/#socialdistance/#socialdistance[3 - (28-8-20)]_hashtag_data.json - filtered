One path may be to have a finance degree and excel in that career. That path may be walking the coastline in Italy while the beauty of a new language rattles around in your head. \n\nOne path may be to revel in art in your own hometown. In LaDonnaFoto's case, it may be all three paths! We at LaDonnaFoto believe life isn't one straight line, and things aren't black and white and cut and dry. LaDonnaFoto has attempted to capture the complexities of life through their landscape photography. While there are always constants in life, like the constants in the photos of water and sunshine, there is so much variety as well. And, just like when the water may be hard to spot in LaDonnaFoto's photos, consistency in life can be hard to spot. A lot of us are on an unprecedented and unique path right now and as much as we wish things were black and white, there's a lot of gray, and blue, and gold! We feel it's important to transport yourself when you are faced with a new path in life, this can help provide a new perspective and help you find your own constants, and you can do so by enjoying the landscape photography at LaDonnaFoto's studio @sawyeryards. A lot of us are facing a temporary path right now, but a temporary one that will remain imprinted on our hearts and minds for years to come. While we are going through this temporary journey together, let's remember to be kind, be safe, and be healthy, as those are some of the most important things we can focus on. \n\nWhether our constants in our world are dark black and gloomy grey, or beautiful blue and gleefully gold, we will get through this together. \n\n #LaDonnaFoto #artinhouston #houarts #beautifulitaly #italiagram #italiantravel #naturefotography #Socialdistance #SocialdistanceHouston #italy_creative_pictures #houstonartist #holidaysinitaly","NumberOfLikes":18,"Hashtags":["#LaDonnaFoto","#artinhouston","#houarts","#beautifulitaly","#italiagram","#italiantravel","#naturefotography","#Socialdistance","#SocialdistanceHouston","#italy_creative_pictures","#houstonartist","#holidaysinitaly"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1598048135,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 00:15:35 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"trying to be more personal on this acc because there really is a face behind the food\n\nwhat I\u2019ve been up to 👉\n\nspent the past 5 days boppin around Colorado with my family before I move into my apartment at school!

We are back with #FeatureFriday ! James Fleming started working at Le Fou Frog for 9 months ago, four months of which were hijacked by the beginning of the pandemic. During the spring and summer, James occupied his time like most of us by gardening and putting the golf ball around. When we opened up back in late July, James slid right into the groove again, providing exemplary service and creating an easy going and relaxed atmosphere for his guests. All the froggers agree that James is laid back and positive, a really wonderful waiter and coworker. If you happen to sit in his section tonight, be sure to take his recommendation for the Branzino!\n\n#lefoufrog #dujour #socialdistance #6ft #maskitorcasket #washyourhands #columbusparkkc #kcig #kcfoodie #rivermarketkc #kcmo #france #provence #food #covid19 #pandemic #kansascity #frenchfood #seafood #steak #restaurant #foodideas #photography #vino #wine #somm #sommlife #sommelier #serviceindustry","NumberOfLikes":61,"Hashtags":["#FeatureFriday","#lefoufrog","#dujour","#socialdistance","#6ft","#maskitorcasket","#washyourhands","#columbusparkkc","#kcig","#kcfoodie","#rivermarketkc","#kcmo","#france","#provence","#food","#covid19","#pandemic","#kansascity","#frenchfood","#seafood","#steak","#restaurant","#foodideas","#photography","#vino","#wine","#somm","#sommlife","#sommelier","#serviceindustry"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Le Fou Frog in le Fou Frog.

He developed the concept of Registrar General.\n* He developed the concept of treasury (Bait ul Maal). And he would spent on non Muslims as well from that.\n* He developed the system of taxing importing goods.\n* He decided in his time that coins should have specific weights which should be recorded and then used.\n* He in his leadership announced to never destroy a place of worship to those who are non Muslims.\n* He started the concept of Surveyor General basically. He surveyed and measured the lands and gave this idea to the Muslim world. \n\nMay Allah grant us his companionship in Jannat ul firdous!

We have been grappling with how to host this event because 1) it\u2019s our favorite and 2) Sewickley businesses need your help!\n\nWe\u2019ve gone around and around trying to figure out the best way to host it this fall, and we\u2019ve come up with what we feel is an inventive way to make the event safe for everyone involved - and to bring some good vibes and much-needed business back to Sewickley. \n\n🍲 The \"Soup Crawl To Go\" will follow ALL social distance guidelines. Masks will be required. \n\n🍲 All soups in ONE easy package for pickup with minimal person-to-person contact. Included will be a booklet with detailed descriptions of each soup & restaurant and coupons. \n\n🍲 Time blocks will allow ticket holders to pick up soup according to last name. \n\n🍲 Contact-less curbside pickup will be an option. \n\n🍲  Voting will be done online. \n\nWe will adapt as changes occur; there is a lot of time between now and October. However, we see this as a real opportunity for innovation during this crazy year!\n\n** TICKET HOLDERS FROM MARCH WILL, OF COURSE, BE HONORED. A NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL TICKETS WILL BE SOLD FOR THIS EVENT FOR $20.** \n\n** Link for tickets will be available soon. Please stay tuned. ** \n\nPlease email info@exploresewickley.com with any questions. \n\nLink in bio for the event page.\n\n#exploresewickley #sewickley #soupcrawl #sewickleysoupcrawl #covid19 #socialdistance","NumberOfLikes":45,"Hashtags":["#exploresewickley","#sewickley","#soupcrawl","#sewickleysoupcrawl","#covid19","#socialdistance"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Explore Sewickley on August 21, 2020.

Playing piano and singing songs I enjoy have been a wonderful release. Music really does heal. 🎶\n\n- Lastly, set your boundaries with people!
