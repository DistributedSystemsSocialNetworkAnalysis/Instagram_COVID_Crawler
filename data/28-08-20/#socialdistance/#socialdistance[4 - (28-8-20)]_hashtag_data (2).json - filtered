The President eloquently talks about creating a safe space for student-athletes to share stories and support one another. Mental health is on a spectrum that includes both biological and environmental factors, and all student-athletes are collectively in the same boat with the uncertainty of the upcoming school year. Instilling systems to weather any storm, including COVID, The Hidden Opponent has implemented an umbrella system of Campus Captains to be mental health advocates across universities nationwide. Looking to be a part of the outstanding mental wellness support team, Ryan sends Ben an SOS and applies for a new internship within the organization. After inspiring The Chrises to start a new segment, One Word, Ben chooses \u201Cvulnerability\u201D as the single term to sum up The Hidden Opponent.

First up... Multi-Game Play Circles. \n\n#PlayCircles are a set of two 8\u20195\u201D diam. variety game boards which use four square, hopscotch, and skee-ball as the foundation for socially distant imaginative play. Built into the boards are four player markers spaced 6\u2019 apart with a 6\u2019 circle and square superimposed as a system of measure to create awareness of distance. Play Circles provide a basic framework for play with enough abstraction to allow kids and adults to invent their own games. Boards can be engaged with the body alone, or with chalk, balls, discs, or found materials which expand the possibilities of playing together while staying apart. \n\nDesigned to be a part of school yards or public playgrounds, Play Circles could be utilized on sidewalks, parking lots, or indoors within recreational centers, classrooms, or gyms. Deployable indoor boards can be rolled out and stored away while permanent outdoor boards can be affixed directly onto asphalt for lasting play.\n\nPlay circles offer a flexible setting for teachers, parents, kids, and adults to invent creative ways to play without physical contact, expand classrooms outdoors, and enable users to occupy public space safely and joyfully. \n\nI|W 2020 Fellow and Play Circles Design Lead: Tracy Llewellyn @llewellyndesignstudio","NumberOfLikes":43,"Hashtags":["#PlayCircles"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":6,"Timestamp":1597886839,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 20 03:27:19 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"stache.","NumberOfLikes":42,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Tayo in Atlanta, Georgia.

Keep in mind that these numbers are from last year, and they\u2019re free to everyone in the world who wants to see them. This means that teams can drastically change their rush\/pass ratios based on personnel and a number of different factors. Again, this is something to help you along the way. \nFor those targeting Lamar Jackson if you get sniped, just know there\u2019s plenty of value at the QB position later in drafts.\nJackson and the Ravens were ahead in many games, game script was a huge factor in their place on the list. So, this isn\u2019t saying they had a horrible passing attack (obviously not, but I gotta say it). One note about the Ravens is that when they did air it out they ranked in the top 5 in yards per reception. \nAs we get closer to our respective draft days any nugget helps. Also, as a reminder always keep your options open and stay away from zeroing in on a set strategy. Having a PLAN is great, but let numbers, talent, and opportunity help lead you. \n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n#nfl #fantasy #YourFantasyDoctor #nflmeme #QB1 #FantasyHelp #wewantfootballback #Yahoo #socialdistance #ESPN #footballplayers #league #highlights #americanfootball #sportsclips #footballvideos #fantasyhelp #footballtutor #mockdrafthelp","NumberOfLikes":58,"Hashtags":["#nfl","#fantasy","#YourFantasyDoctor","#nflmeme","#QB1","#FantasyHelp","#wewantfootballback","#Yahoo","#socialdistance","#ESPN","#footballplayers","#league","#highlights","#americanfootball","#sportsclips","#footballvideos","#fantasyhelp","#footballtutor","#mockdrafthelp"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Fantasy Doc in NFL with @washingtonnfl, @49ers, @ravens, @vikings, and @titans.

There are some people who still will travel this year and during the winter season despite the coronavirus health risks. As much of an avid international traveler as I am, given the continuing pandemic and the foreseeable future, I personally would not travel any time soon. ...... For those of you taking the risk, here\u2019s an update of where you can go. \u201CAs of August 12, the following countries are open to Americans, with varying health and safety restrictions in place: Antigua, Aruba, Barbados, Barbuda, Belize, Bermuda, Cambodia, Croatia, Dominican Republic, Egypt, French Polynesia, Jamaica, Maldives, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Rwanda, Serbia, St. Barths, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Tanzania, Turkey, Turks and Caicos, United Arab Emirates and the Virgin Islands.\u201D ...... Keep in mind that this can change at any time. There may be entry requirements (negative test results, quarantines upon arrival). US Re-entry requirements could change while you\u2019re out of the country, and you\u2019ll likely need to quarantine for 14 days when you return to the US. ...... As a travel lover and travel agency owner it pains me to see client\u2019s vacation opportunities restricted for the next several months.

So having wildflowers & a more natural look was important to me when picking flowers and putting it together.  I even tried to convince @jsears90 to let me snip a few flowers on our walk but he didn\u2019t go for it.  I got ~5 different bouquets from Trader Joe\u2019s in Portland to start with and then I pulled them apart and paired flowers together.  So for every yellow I did a white and then I filled in the purple and red and finished it off with 3 eucalyptus evenly spaced.  Wrapping it with the floral tape and then the ribbon took 2 pairs of hands, but overall I was pleasantly surprised by how quick & easy it was to make my #bouquet \nPRO TIP: Don\u2019t use your fancy Kate Spade scissors to cut flower stems 🤣🤦🏻\u200D♀️\n\nAnd for any #brides, feel free to use my Elopement playlist. \n\nhttps:\/\/open.spotify.com\/playlist\/1TvsahKNRWuWdloxdd3qsH?si=5rHB1a3aQhOrmFwlw0-2qg\n\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n#elopementday #elopementmorning #loveisnotcancelled #loveisntcancelled #luckofthesears #pintofsears #wedding #weddings #covidbride #covidwedding #minimony #fiance #fiancé #marriage #married #newlywed #walk #lover #mylove #lovehim #lovehimsomuch #almostmrs #misstomrs #socialdistance #nikon #weddinginspiration #kiss #travel","NumberOfLikes":17,"Hashtags":["#bouquet","#brides,","#elopementday","#elopementmorning","#loveisnotcancelled","#loveisntcancelled","#luckofthesears","#pintofsears","#wedding","#weddings","#covidbride","#covidwedding","#minimony","#fiance","#fiancé","#marriage","#married","#newlywed","#walk","#lover","#mylove","#lovehim","#lovehimsomuch","#almostmrs","#misstomrs","#socialdistance","#nikon","#weddinginspiration","#kiss","#travel"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597770214,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 18 19:03:34 CEST 2020","Location":"Seaside, Oregon"},{"CaptionText":"Started this series of \u201CPRO TIPS\u201D on #Facebook back on July 4th as a way to vent about the current political \/ social \/ racial \/ medial stories and fear flooding my media outlets... but also to open it up to friendly conversation ( NOT DEBATES - definitely not interested in #politcaldebates ). \n\nLove you all!\n\n#foodforthought #protip #politics #religion #racism #policebrutality #blm #blacklivesmatter #alllivesmatter #political #politicallycorrect #politicallyincorrect #socialism #capitalism #communism #marxists #covid19 #covid_19 #basicmath #coronavirus #partofthesolution #masks #socialdistance #partoftheproblem #president #news #meme #Trump","NumberOfLikes":4,"Hashtags":["#Facebook","#politcaldebates","#foodforthought","#protip","#politics","#religion","#racism","#policebrutality","#blm","#blacklivesmatter","#alllivesmatter","#political","#politicallycorrect","#politicallyincorrect","#socialism","#capitalism","#communism","#marxists","#covid19","#covid_19","#basicmath","#coronavirus","#partofthesolution","#masks","#socialdistance","#partoftheproblem","#president","#news","#meme","#Trump"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Jerrell The Conner🌀 on August 18, 2020 tagging @republicanparty, @thedemocrats, @rightwing.news, @theradicalleftvids, and @villainlife.official.

Parents with kids in the school system are overwhelmed and don\u2019t know the right move. University\/college students are afraid their (in many cases) lesser online education will hurt them down the line. People with chronic illness are on even LONGER wait times and anxious to enter hospitals to see necessary specialists. Individuals and families are locked into houses they\u2019re long done with because almost no one can afford this market. People still aren\u2019t able to see their grandparents. Friends are doing going in for chemo alone. On top of all of that, life still goes on. People are still dealing with loss and grief and addiction and mental illness and discouragement and loneliness and family breakdown and deteriorating health and xyz. \n\nIf this pandemic doesn\u2019t bring us back to our roots as individuals and communities, I cannot imagine a more grandiose waste. \n\nMy honest to god prayer to the heavens and the earth is that this year radically changes us and makes us genuinely kinder and more socially active human beings. May we please start actually attending funerals for people other than immediate family. May we bake and cook for those mourning and celebrating and grieving and achieving. May we make it second nature to put ourselves in someone else\u2019s shoes and have empathy instead of judgment. May we commit to the education and betterment of ourselves and always be learning and improving in order to properly show up to this ever changing world of ours. May we open up our living rooms (or backyards #socialdistance) to those who need someone. May we physically show up with every capacity we have instead of just sending well wishes with our thumbs. May we not demonize being \u201Cpolitical\u201D and instead actively concern ourselves with things of value and weight. May we pay it forward at Tim Hortons. May we share our favourite nature spots with loved ones. \n\nMy God may we love.","NumberOfLikes":24,"Hashtags":["#socialdistance)"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by rebekah richardson on August 18, 2020.

It seems like the world has only one thing on their mind: CORONAVIRUS!!! \n\nHere are some reminders while youre at home -- try not to pick your nose. Snot and boogers can spread germs 👾👾 that carry coronavirus. When someone coughs or sneezes it lands on door handles, tables, iphones and pencils. Even sandwiches 🥪🌭. The germs can stick there for a few days. If you stand too close to somebody, who coughs or sneezes 🤧🤧, you might breathe it in. They're so small you cant even see them. Make sure to keep your distance (about 2 kid moko jumbie sticks away ~6ft). And wash your hands a lot, a lot. With soap and bubbles or hand sanitizer. \n\nYou might need to spend a lot of time around your home to avoid spreading the virus. If you go outside, wear your mask 😷😷 as much as possible. Over your nose and mouth, not upside down or inside out. Or even your friend's mask. Thats gross.\n\nDo go outside and play. If you have stilts, walk tall. If you have a bike, ride like the wind. Most of all, keep being brave. Keep being a kid.

Parents will worry, kids could be anxious, and it presents a whole new set of\nchallenges for teachers, custodians and school boards.\nHoping that this new normal will role out without too much extra stress in your households. Our new normal\nhas become routine. We are more conscious of cleaning our hands, more respectful of personal space, we are\nmore considerate of other\u2019s anxieties, so we wear masks. We can unite and get our kids back to a routine that \nwill keep them emotionally happier exercising their brains, and learning in classroom once again.\nTake the time to talk to your kids about how they are feeling. Together we can start this school year off right.\n \n#TeamBurca #FamiliyhelpingFamilies #PreparingforSchool #Classroomslookdifferent #HeroesTogether #Protectingourfamilies\n#SocialDistance #Washyourhands #Respecteachstudent #ParentshelpingParents #SchoolYear #SeptemberisComing","NumberOfLikes":9,"Hashtags":["#TeamBurca","#FamiliyhelpingFamilies","#PreparingforSchool","#Classroomslookdifferent","#HeroesTogether","#Protectingourfamilies","#SocialDistance","#Washyourhands","#Respecteachstudent","#ParentshelpingParents","#SchoolYear","#SeptemberisComing"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Team Burca Real Estate on August 17, 2020.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597695741,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 22:22:21 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Thank you @g_ma_darlene3. 😷✌🏼💙","NumberOfLikes":4,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Hidden Smiles in Santa Monica, California with @g_ma_darlene3.

For patients recovering at home, treatment is mainly #supportive. For people with #mild symptoms, this means staying well rested, drinking plenty of fluids, and monitoring symptoms. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever or chills, cough, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, runny nose or congestion, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea. Some people have more severe symptoms that require hospitalization.\n\nWhat Is Preventive Care?\n\nYou can be infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) while taking care of someone with COVID-19. Although there is not yet a vaccine to prevent COVID-19, infection is preventable. The most important steps to #prevent spread are wearing a #mask, maintaining #socialdistance whenever possible, #washinghands often, and #cleaning and #sanitizing the home.\n\nFor More Information\n* \tCaring for someone sick (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC])\u2028www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/if-you-are-sick\/care-for-someone.html\n* \tClinical care guidance (CDC)\u2028www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/hcp\/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html","NumberOfLikes":26,"Hashtags":["#cure","#COVID-19),","#supportive.","#mild","#prevent","#mask,","#socialdistance","#washinghands","#cleaning","#sanitizing"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Dr Sandhya Ramanathan on August 17, 2020.
