But they were so supportive and as part of helping my growth and love for reading they gave me the VIP spot reading the bible and daily devotional at our family devotion my dad gently correcting every wrong pronunciation. I dreaded morning devotions especially if it was my day to read the devotional. The parentals taught me an important lesson as a little girl\n\u2014\nNow as an adult if you asked me what my happy place is I\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s my place of devotion with God and books.

I\u2019ve practiced not taking things personally\u2014so I\u2019m not easily hurt, rather I\u2019m sensitive to others\u2019 needs, experiences, pain, and reactions. I can pick up on what needs to be healed, and speak healing or provide reframing to that aspect. I have familiarized myself with my own darkness and unconsciousness, and have deep enough compassion to hold the hand of another and walk with them through their own darkness, feeling the depth of that pain with a person, so they don\u2019t feel alone in it. I can feel both my unconditional and limitless well of love and compassion, as well as my temporal and physical limitations during this experience. And, truly, my willingness to be THIS open and vulnerable to the depth and fullness of life, whether good or bad, has granted me access to the juiciest, deepest, most delicious parts of life. I have accessed levels of feeling that most people dare not allow. I\u2019m excited to figure out how to use this power and these tools to help more people\u2014whether that looks like going back to school to become a psychologist or counselor, or becoming a life coach, or whatever.

With the doggos we were not allowed to enter buildings with them but were allowed to switch off and check things out as needed which I don\u2019t mind because the preservation of such a place is much needed. The infamous swallows are not migrating here this time of the year but the butterfly\u2019s and bees were out in full force and enjoying the gardens with us. We used boots when it got warm for the dogs so you\u2019ll notice some pics with boots and some without. The ruins area was like seeing part of the coliseum destroyed. It was a fun day trip for sure. We crossed the street from the mission and ate at a little Italian place afterwards. Then we cruised over to Dana Point and went over to the Strand Beach. Strand Beach is crazy because you have to walk down about ten flights of stairs to get to it.... and no I diddnt even attempt it, it would have ended me for a week at least. There is a rolling elevator but it\u2019s closed thanks to the Rona. Liz and Lonnie ran down and played in the ocean for a few minutes while I walked the dogs on the trail at the top for the righteous view. #sanjuancapistranomission #sanjuancapistrano #fountains #butterflies #bees #servicedogs #servicepoodles #autismsupportdog #dogboots #anxiety #chronicpain #backpain #daytrip #enrichment #history #mentalhealth #mentalwellness #selfcare #summertime #socialdistance #stircrazy #nationalrelaxationday #familytime","NumberOfLikes":61,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1597588833,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 16 16:40:33 CEST 2020","Location":"San Juan Capistrano Misson"},{"CaptionText":"かわゆき自宅警備員\n#黒猫\n#ペルシャ猫\n#茶猫\n#SOCIALDISTANCE","NumberOfLikes":36,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597588782,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 16 16:39:42 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"58日目☺️\n飼い始めた当初から比べてみるとどんどん白くなってる。。。\n何でこんなに色が薄くなっちゃったんだろう🥺🥺🥺\n\n質問です！最近暑すぎて、水温が30度オーバーしてるんですけど、どうしてますか？\n金魚、寒いのは苦手って聞いてたけど、暑いのはどうなんだろう。（ググれば良い話なんだけど皆様どうされてるのかなと気になり質問です）\n\n#ピンポンパール飼育 #ピンポンパール \n#ピンポンパール可愛い\n #金魚#金魚水槽 \n#金魚のいる暮らし \n#金魚好きさんと繋がりたい  #飼育記録\n#ペットのいる生活 #きんぎょ#かわいい\n #fish #kawaii #cute #cutefish\n #goldfish #goldfishofinstagram #goldfishlove #goldfishlover #金魚初心者#socialdistance #ステイホーム\n#stayhome","NumberOfLikes":44,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ピンポンパール（金魚）の飼育記録 on August 16, 2020.","NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1597588495,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 16 16:34:55 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Yep.","NumberOfLikes":24,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Markus Sebring on August 16, 2020.

I'm Dr. Hina Talib, teen doc and toddler mom. Everyone is talking about mental health concerns in teens & YA's. A top worry is for the lonely teen.\u2009\n\u2009\n😌I'm hearing this from teens who have been isolated due to stay-at-home orders & also, looking forward, to the fall with school non-re-opening about. Even schools\u2009\nthat will open virtually or distanced, students have asked me how they will be able to connect to peers. \u2009\n\u2009\n😳Also, many teens were lonely before the pandemic! Loneliness can look different in different kids, & you may not know unless you ask (even a kid who is social or extroverted may feel lonely). Only way to know is through communication & active listening. \u2009\n\u2009\n👩🏻\u200D⚕️I hope these tips help:\u2009\n\u2009\n✔️A feeling of connection can come through organizing with others for a common goal, help find a cause that speaks to them, or it can be a family activity. \u2009\n\u2009\n✔️In early pandemic survey studies, time spent with family was a strong protective factor against depression\/anxiety for teens. Be present with them. \u2009\n\u2009\n✔️Consider podding with 1-2 families of close & like minded (regards to safety) peers for your teen.  Can think of this as a mental health pod for your kid. This can be done for those attending & zooming into school. For some, this might mean a little more distance from grandparents, for a time. Safety, trust & communication \u2009\n\u2009\n✔️Physical touch helps. Snuggle that kid, have kids snuggle their sibs\/pets. \u2009\n\u2009\n✔️Teachers are such pros. Lean into them & their ideas to help increase connections in the \"classrooms\"\u2009\n\u2009\n✔️If things feel out of balance remember, therapy is available, can ask Pediatrician & schools what their counseling plans are. A tele-health group of problem-solving lonely teens sound awesome to me. \u2009\n\u2009\n✔️Feeling left out when peers are not distancing is tough one. Running out of room, will answer in stories!\u2009\n\u2009\nDrop a ❤️ if this was helpful & pls tag friend below. What has helped your tween, teen and YAs feel less lonely? I asked this in a question box, will share your helpful responses to my stories too, later today.

Per circa due settimane avresti festeggiato la fine dei lavori agricoli ballando e brindando a Conso, dio della terra e della fertilità. Infatti i romani, chiamavano questo periodo i Consualia.\nL'imperatore Augusto, che di marketing se ne intendeva, dedica questi festeggiamenti a lui stesso, al suo riposo. Da qui feriae Augusti (dopo tanto \u201Cimpereggiare\u201D anche lui aveva bisogno di ferie, no?). Lo stesso mese prende il nome da lui!\nPer tutto l'impero venivano organizzate feste e corse di cavalli (chissà che la tradizione del palio di Siena non provenga proprio da qui!). Anche gli animali che avevano aiutato gli uomini nei lavori agricoli \u201Candavano in ferie\u201D e venivano adornati di fiori! Durante i festeggiamenti i contadini andavano ad omaggiare i proprietari terrieri per ringraziarli, e questi, in cambio, gli donavano dei soldi, una specie di mancia. La celebrazione vera e propria era il 1° di Agosto ma i festeggiamenti duravano fino al 13, il giorno dedicato alla dea Diana. Nei secoli la tradizione rimase: guai a chi abolisce una festa! Quindi la Chiesa Cattolica spostò il giorno di festa dal 1° al 15 e lo dedicò all'Assunzione in cielo, anima e corpo, di Maria (dogma che sarà riconosciuto solo nel 1950). \nA Siena invece, durante il medioevo, per il 15 di Agosto, avresti assistito alla processione \u201Cdei ceri e dei censi\u201D: un atto di vassallaggio dei castelli e dei signori del territorio senese alla Repubblica. Le celebrazioni culminavano con la corsa dei cavalli: chi raggiungeva per primo la Cattedrale, dopo esser partito da una delle porte della città, vinceva un \u201Cpallium\u201D, un grande pezzo di stoffa preziosa, che avrebbe poi dato il nome alla Festa. Un palio decisamente diverso da quello attuale (che oggi si svolge il 16 del mese).\nPer tutti questo sarà un \u201Cferragosto\u201D decisamente insolito (figuriamoci per i senesi!). Speriamo di \u201Crifarci\u201D l'anno prossimo, magari con lo stesso entusiasmo che ci mettevano i romani!","NumberOfLikes":12,"AccessibilityCaption":"Dipinto che riprende una festa in epoca romana.
