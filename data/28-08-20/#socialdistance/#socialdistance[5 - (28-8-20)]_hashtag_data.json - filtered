UV-C based disinfection is widely used in water and air purification.\n\nUV-C disinfection is widely seen in household as well as industrial and municipal water filters. UV-C is also used in disinfection of surfaces in bio-medical environments and has recently been used in disinfecting aeroplane cabins by Honeywell.\n\nThe same concept is being used here to disinfect groceries, mobile phone, wallets, keys, masks and any other object that can transmit microorganism and pathogens.\n\nDue to COVID-19 pandemic it has become very risky to even buy groceries and products that can get easily surface contaminated with Coronavirus. The UV Chamber is an effective way to increase the personal safety at home.\n\nThis project is very cheap and easy to build at home.

The gig sold out in under 2 minutes, crashing its website. 2,500 fans from across the UK made up the crowd, gathering in groups of up to 5, on socially distanced platforms. Each group had an allocated arrival slot and rules were put in place so people stayed on their platforms ensuring the safety of others around them. \n\nOverall, the gig was successful and many other artists are considering a similar approach.

This is one slide of 5 that is a succinct snap shot of a current ideals. \n.\nI\u2019ve always been inspired by chef kinch, unfortunately from a distance, but there are just things that he\u2019s said that have stuck with me. From @chefpodcast he said \u201Cit\u2019s our job to make them better cooks than we were.\u201D That idea of passing along knowledge and encouragement is amazing. Too many chefs think it\u2019s about their egos and earning the right to put someone down. I want to treat my cooks better than I was. I want to inspire them. And when I\u2019m old and frail and out of the game, to see that they are bringing on the next generation. \n.\nIn this recent post, he also speaks of not referring to the pre-Covid times as the \u201Cgolden age\u201D but the \u201Cgilded age\u201D. There is the proof on the plate of ornate over substance, but he speaks also of business practices and labour. That ornate plate comes at a cost and that is usually on the backs of the staff or stages. \n.\nThe @thecountycanteen adapted when we opened phase 3. We switched to an as environmentally conscious disposable plating, cutlery and glass ware for the protection of the staff. Would you want to be handling a strangers fork they have slobbered on or glass with their lipstick amidst a PANDEMIC? Unfortunately one google review was not happy with these choices. Fuck them. Our food and service are still grand. Classic pre-Covid menu items are still cooked with care. So our Wollenburger comes on a tray instead of a plate. Some fucking burger, same great taste. And the new items are the bomb. We have just got our feet down and now working on more dishes. \n.\nFront of house, back of house and the public has to realize we\u2019re in a new game now. We get to decide some of the rules, outside of covid. The staff decides what behaviors will be accepted. Over the last couple years, I\u2019ve been referred to as a kitchen feminist...now Covid has turned up the volume on all my intersectional activism. And public, adapt your expectations and live in the moment. Enjoy what you get to do.

Please continue to stay safe, be considerate of others just as you would appreciate them being considerate to those closest to you, like your most vulnerable family members. I didn't anticipate sharing this as I started typing this post, but suddenly felt compelled to share with you all that I personally contracted Covid-19 over a month ago now. I found out that I was in contact with someone who wasn't taking this virus seriously, and called it a \"flu\". From first hand experience, this is not the \"flu\". It's a nasty Virus. It sucks. It beats you up hard, knocks you on your ass, and takes alot of energy, caution, self and aided care to recover.  I  can see how anyone with underlying conditions would suffer greatly with this nasty thing. I'm fortunate enough to have recovered, and never had to be hospitalized. I was down for 4 days. Most importantly to me was that my family and close friends didn't catch this thing with me. \nI get we don't want to live in fear, or feel \"controlled\", and I believe life shouldn't be lived with that fear. We have to keep living. However, I do believe we can all be just a little less selfish, and less inconsiderate of what we \"assume\" something you don't truly understand, is. Respect someone who cares enough to wear a mask, or keeps a safe social distance. They could be doing your most vulnerable friends and family a favor. The reality of the matter is this Virus will be around for a long time. So let's work together to keep the f'er in check. Stay safe people. Let's be considerate of each other.\n#covid19sucks #protectyourselves #and #those #around #you #be #courteous #live #withoutfear #but #dont #be #an #asshole #coveryourmouth #when #in #close #proximity #to #others #you #dont #live #with #or #keep #a #safeandhealthy #socialdistance Just be a good human 😏 Rant, done.

I can pick up on what needs to be healed, and speak healing or provide reframing to that aspect. I have familiarized myself with my own darkness and unconsciousness, and have deep enough compassion to hold the hand of another and walk with them through their own darkness, feeling the depth of that pain with a person, so they don\u2019t feel alone in it. I can feel both my unconditional and limitless well of love and compassion, as well as my temporal and physical limitations during this experience. And, truly, my willingness to be THIS open and vulnerable to the depth and fullness of life, whether good or bad, has granted me access to the juiciest, deepest, most delicious parts of life. I have accessed levels of feeling that most people dare not allow.

In de media horen we verschillende meningen, die elkaar soms ronduit tegenspreken. Het lijkt soms wel een battle tussen bijvoorbeeld viruswaanzin en het RIVM. Door al die verschillende meningen weten mensen niet meer wat ze moeten geloven. Het gesprek over het coronavirus lijkt zwart-wit, terwijl er juist grote grijze gebieden zijn van dingen die we nog niet zeker weten. Er is gewoon nog veel onzeker, dat is niet prettig, maar voorlopig moeten we met die onzekerheid leven.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nHet is in deze tijd verleidelijk om te roepen dat het kabinet meer maatregelen moet nemen, of juist minder. Sommige mensen worden opstandig en houden zich helemaal niet meer aan de maatregelen, anderen leven juist te veel in angst. Er is minder ruimte voor een open gesprek over dat wat we niet weten. Dat kan weer leiden tot een tunnelvisie en het versterkt het zwart-wit gesprek. \n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nIk wil mensen oproepen om niet naar anderen te wijzen, of zich te laten leiden door \u2018corona-moeheid\u2019, vakantie, recalcitrant gedrag of het zwart-wit gesprekken. Dit is een oproep om eigenaarschap te nemen, allemaal op onze eigen manier verantwoordelijkheid nemen voor onszelf en onze directe omgeving. Want ook al lijkt het misschien niet altijd zo, u heeft ook een deel van de coronacrisis en de gevolgen daarvan in uw hand.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nIn de aankomende posts zal ik bespreken hoe u eigenaarschap kunt nemen. Ik bespreek het belang van risico-inschattingen en zal ik informatie geven om die op een verantwoorde manier te maken.","NumberOfLikes":35,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597564055,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 16 09:47:35 CEST 2020","Location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands"},{"CaptionText":"#l4l #ootd #socialdistance #instagram #vscofilter #1998cam #follow #instafashion #me #japan","NumberOfLikes":52,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by 馬 on August 16, 2020 tagging @pumawomen, and @2100xtokyo.

So, as ever, your support is always appreciated, even more so in the current climate, so we'll hopefully see you next weekend, let's help kickstart the scene back into life and appreciate what we've all missed during the first half of 2020.\n#gig #socialdistance #sociallydistanced #indoormusic #letthemusicplay #bringbacklive #therigger #newcastleunderlyme #band #rock #rocknroll #blues #heavyblues #fuzzyblues #gibson #fender #mapex #hartke #orangeamps #wereback #settinganexample","NumberOfLikes":11,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1597562219,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 16 09:16:59 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#mangomojito #paseos #cheers #umbrellacheer #summervibes #socialdistance #drinkoutside #patio","NumberOfLikes":5,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597562129,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 16 09:15:29 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"こんにちは、 10日間ほど  どこにも行かなかったのでインスタもアップしませんでした が昨日近くのイングリッシュガーデンへ出かけてみたところあまりの暑さにすぐ退散しました 。この暑さといいコロナウイルスといい 人間が地球の自然を破壊しすぎたので何か 反撃にあっている という気がします。#findyouryokohama #myyokohama #discrètement #ひとりひとり真面目に取り組む #みんなで乗り越えよう #免疫力アップ #mytownyokohama#横浜イングリッシュガーデン  #solidarité#fleursdesaison 🌸 #ほどよい距離感 #grandnature #散歩は近所の公園へ #overcometheenemy#socialdistance#pourvotrebien#monendroitpréféré #balade #gardening #kaleidoscope #naturephotography #flowerpower #flowersinstagram #yokohamaenglishgarden #tenderness #rosiers#greens#\n #お出かけしたい #cozyplace #fleursdeete🐝🐝🌷🌼🌺🌸","NumberOfLikes":85,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597562111,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 16 09:15:11 CEST 2020","Location":"横浜イングリッシュガーデン"},{"CaptionText":"Ofertat e javës🍴\nWeekly Special Offers 🇲🇽\n\n1.

Não é tão simples deixar os sonhos descansando e deixar na memória os abraços calorosos. \nCovid-19 nos mostrou a dificuldade em ficar longe, em ter que se distanciar, precisar colocar um pouco de lado o carinho, manter o rosto coberto e proteger as mãos em frações de segundos. \nEu me desesperei e enfraqueci em muitos momentos, eu deixei de lado a segurança em vários deles e provavelmente coloquei em risco a segurança de alguém e, até mesmo a minha. Eu fui hipócrita quando reclamei de forma egoísta que o país que eu escolhi morar decidiu fazer o lockdown. Eu me responsabilizo pela falha, mas hoje eu entendi que foi por um bem maior e pela segurança da maioria. Voltando tudo mais ou menos ao normal, eu só queria poder exercitar mais a minha humanidade e entender que ser humilde também é uma questão de confiar naqueles que sabem mais, naqueles que possuem mais e melhores informações, naqueles que estudaram e são mais capacitados para escolherem por mim, quando eu mesma não tinha maturidade pra fazer essa escolha. \nHoje eu sou grata, grata por ter escolhido esse país, que me deu dignidade pra continuar em casa, que me deu oportunidade de estar segura, que cuidou de mim e de outras pessoas que também não tinham maturidade pra escolher. Estou grata pelos números de mortes não terem sido tão altos, mas pela quantidade de sobreviventes e curados terem ultrapassado os dados da tristeza. \nUma vida perdida é uma vida perdida. Não importa o número final, importa a vida que se perdeu. E por todos os que se foram, meu luto e respeito.\nPor todos que ficaram, gratidão. E que a vacina seja feita logo, porque sair correndo no aeroporto pra abraçar alguém vai ser um sentimento que eu nunca mais vou deixar de lado! #thanksIreland #thankyouIreland #obrigadaIrlanda \n.\n.\n.\n.\n#socialdistance #coronavirus #quarantinemood #thatsenough #corona #covid19 #2020termine #keepdistance #lockdown #newnormal #novonormal #vacinaporfavor #vaccineplease #style #estilo #estilosa #mulheresempoderadas #travelphotography","NumberOfLikes":109,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Evelyn in Tallaght.

There were so many times throughout the day I noticed the way Callum would look at Stephanie. So much love. And the speeches...oh man oh man. Let\u2019s just say there was a lot of tears.

But it is not enough: this crisis is too big, and it is lasting too long.\n\nToday, across America there are long lines of people waiting for hours in the summer heat to fulfill some of the most basic human needs: to feed themselves and their family. We cannot solve the hunger crisis with philanthropy alone.\nThank you Angela Alsobrooks, and the entire Prince George's County Team for your continued hands on The Hunger Relief Crisis.\n\nWithout your ongoing support, none of WCK\u2019s work would be possible \u2014 we are so grateful. 🧡\n#TheCarolinaKitchen #drlancelondon #WorldCentralKitchen #ChefsForAmerica #SocialDistance #SafeDistancing #LendAHelpingHand #JoseAndres #AngelaAlsobrooks #PrinceGeorgesCounty","NumberOfLikes":78,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1597498388,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 15:33:08 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"My new gavel arrived!

Si a esto le sumamos las posturas prolongadas e inadecuadas, estaremos hablando de dolor y problemas de salud en un futuro no muy lejano. \n\nEnseñar a los niños a ser conscientes de su cuerpo y de su postura les ayuda a conocerse mejor. Es nuestra labor como adultos guiarlos hacia su salud.\n\nPara esto, te tengo las siguientes recomendaciones:\n\n✔️ Eleva la computadora a su nivel para que el cuello del niño esté en posición neutra.\n\n✔️ Coloca un banquito para que apoye sus pies. Esto le brindará equilibrio a sus músculos y articulaciones.\n\n✔️ Si sólo cuentas con sillas grandes, coloca una o dos almohadas para que apoye su cuello y espalda.\n\n✔️ Si tu hijo es muy inquieto y se cansa rápido de la silla, sientalo por ratos en un cojín o balón terapéutico.\n\n✔️ La posición prona o Boca abajo le permite al niño descansar del patrón flexor que da la silla. Es excelente para mejorar la propiocepcion y la fuerza del tronco.\n\n✔️ La posición de rodillas le ayudará en su equilibrio y a la fuerza del CORE\n\n#fisiotipsonline #fisioterapia #fisio #terapiafisica #rehabilitacion #ejercicio #postura #espalda #columna #niños #aprendizaje #escuelaadistancia\n#quedateencasa #covid19 #coronavirus #chitreanos6 #chitre_progresa #panama #educacion #education #socialdistance #chiriqui #veraguas #cocle #zoom #laberraquerac6herrera #noticias_azuero_","NumberOfLikes":24,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597495399,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 14:43:19 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"\"Perjuanganku lebih mudah karena mengusir penjajah, tapi perjuanganmu lebih sulit karena melawan bangsamu sendiri.\"\n-Bung Karno\n.\nDIRGAHAYU REPUBLIK INDONESIA❤\n.\nPada tahun ini, kegiatan-kegiatan dalam rangka HUT RI Ke-75 sangat berbeda dengan tahun-tahun sebelumnya.

Per circa due settimane avresti festeggiato la fine dei lavori agricoli ballando e brindando a Conso, dio della terra e della fertilità. Infatti i romani, chiamavano questo periodo i Consualia.\nL'imperatore Augusto, che di marketing se ne intendeva, dedica questi festeggiamenti a lui stesso, al suo riposo. Da qui feriae Augusti (dopo tanto \u201Cimpereggiare\u201D anche lui aveva bisogno di ferie, no?). Lo stesso mese prende il nome da lui!\nPer tutto l'impero venivano organizzate feste e corse di cavalli (chissà che la tradizione del palio di Siena non provenga proprio da qui!). Anche gli animali che avevano aiutato gli uomini nei lavori agricoli \u201Candavano in ferie\u201D e venivano adornati di fiori! Durante i festeggiamenti i contadini andavano ad omaggiare i proprietari terrieri per ringraziarli, e questi, in cambio, gli donavano dei soldi, una specie di mancia. La celebrazione vera e propria era il 1° di Agosto ma i festeggiamenti duravano fino al 13, il giorno dedicato alla dea Diana. Nei secoli la tradizione rimase: guai a chi abolisce una festa! Quindi la Chiesa Cattolica spostò il giorno di festa dal 1° al 15 e lo dedicò all'Assunzione in cielo, anima e corpo, di Maria (dogma che sarà riconosciuto solo nel 1950). \nA Siena invece, durante il medioevo, per il 15 di Agosto, avresti assistito alla processione \u201Cdei ceri e dei censi\u201D: un atto di vassallaggio dei castelli e dei signori del territorio senese alla Repubblica. Le celebrazioni culminavano con la corsa dei cavalli: chi raggiungeva per primo la Cattedrale, dopo esser partito da una delle porte della città, vinceva un \u201Cpallium\u201D, un grande pezzo di stoffa preziosa, che avrebbe poi dato il nome alla Festa. Un palio decisamente diverso da quello attuale (che oggi si svolge il 16 del mese).\nPer tutti questo sarà un \u201Cferragosto\u201D decisamente insolito (figuriamoci per i senesi!). Speriamo di \u201Crifarci\u201D l'anno prossimo, magari con lo stesso entusiasmo che ci mettevano i romani!","NumberOfLikes":12,"AccessibilityCaption":"Dipinto che riprende una festa in epoca romana.

Jumlah sel NK adalah 10-15% dari semua limfosit perifer darah. Sel NK termasuk dalam kelompok sel limfoid bawaan yaitu kelompok sel limfoid namun bekerja pada sistem imun bawaan. Sel NK mengekpresikan reseptor yang berbeda dengan turunan limfosit pada umumnya yaitu tidak memiliki TCR, CD3, dan reseptor Ig. Protein marker dari sel NK adalah molekul CD16 dan CD56.[1]\n\nSel NK tidak menyerang sel yang mempunyai ekspresi protein MHC (sama seperti sel T CD8), tetapi menyerang sel yang tidak memiliki ekspresi protein MHC tubuh.[2] Sel-sel dinamakan sel pembunuh alami karena sel-sel bisa langsung beraksi tanpa membutuhkan aktivasi.

Automatic doors so you don\u2019t need to touch the handle, people operating lifts so you don\u2019t have to press buttons, and probably even ditching away with the communal coffee machine for some other contact-less alternative. Workspaces will become more safety conscious, and more impersonal, with employees having dedicated agile and versatile cubicles to suit all their needs. @keith_melbourne envisioned how design intervention can create a new sort of stylish-yet-safe workplace with the Avion.\u2060⠀\n\u2060⠀\nThe Avion is a modular workspace setup that comes with a contemporary design with soft curves, chic furniture, and a modern color palette to help make the workspace look friendly and appealing.

Und der müssen wir uns stellen. So wie Richard Reisen, Ex-Wachmann, Buchdesigner, und Fotograf. Noch bis 30. August wird seine Ausstellung 'Übergangsheim Schiessstraße \u2013 Fotografien zwischen Flur und Pforte' im Stadtmuseum Düsseldorf präsentiert; kuratiert von Wolfgang Zurborn.\n\nIhre Bilder von Flüchtlingen und Migranten von 1989 in einem Übergangsheim in Düsseldorf-Heerdt 'erfüllen alle Kriterien dessen, was man in der Ethnologie und der Soziologie eine teilnehmende Beobachtung' nennt. Sie sind 'gleichermaßen historisch wie aktuell', so Prof. Rolf Sachsse. Wie haben Sie es geschafft, als respekteinflößender Wachmann, der Sie damals waren, Vertrauen zu wohl eher verängstigten und verunsicherten Menschen aufzubauen? - Ich bin und war nie Respekt einflößend, zumindest ist das nicht die Art Respekt, die ich mir wünsche. Das alles hat wohl eher mit Machtausübung zu tun und das ist mir zuwider. Die Menschen die dort wohnten, hatten viel erlebt und durchlitten und waren mir an Erfahrung weit überlegen. Das war die Creme, das sind die Survivors, die es schaffen hier anzukommen. Da bin ich ein Weichei dagegen\u2026 Also der Respekt war ganz meinerseits. Zudem konnte ich mit dem einzigen Telefon aufwarten und den Jungs das Leben damit etwas angenehmer machen. Empathie wird eben erwidert und ich fand es spannend, immer neue Leute kennen zu lernen, in deren Leben ich mich einfühlen durfte.\n\nEin Laie würde kaum erkennen, dass das 'Totschlagen von Zeit durch Haareschneiden, Rauchen, Telefonieren, Herumhängen' eher Höhepunkte im Zusammenleben von Migranten darstellen: wie konnten Sie diese Situationen so aufnehmen, als wären sie 'noch nie vorher gesehen worden'?\nWenn Rolf Sachsse das schreibt, ist das ein großes Kompliment. Ich bin allerdings mit den Bildern auch in einer vergleichsfreien Situation, weil ich zumindest bei meinen Recherchen nichts zum Thema in der Zeit gefunden habe. Für mich bot die Situation die Möglichkeit, mich täglich zu entfremden. Ich war jeden Tag wie im Ausland und abends dann wieder zuhause um meine Filme zu entwickeln.

This principle applies both to role play activities like the ones described above in Step 5 and when transitioning to real life scenarios.\n\nConsider what the best rewards are for your child and deliver them as soon as possible. Should your child earn stickers for social distancing correctly? Will social praise alone work? Should you count out loud each time your child demonstrates social distancing correctly, and then when reaching a certain\nnumber, let your child do something they really like to do? The point is to make good things happen when your child social distances correctly.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget immediate corrective feedback as well. If your child is not social distancing correctly, stop the behavior as quickly as possible and help your child to be successful.
