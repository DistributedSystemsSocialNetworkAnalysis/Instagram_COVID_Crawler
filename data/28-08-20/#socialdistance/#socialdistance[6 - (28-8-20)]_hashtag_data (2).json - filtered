Madison County residents connected to these LTC Outbreaks have already been counted in our Daily Update posts and on our Data Dashboard. ⠀\n⠀\nThe good news is that 9 LTC Outbreaks have been CLOSED. Once a LTC facility reaches 28 days without a new case, that particular outbreak moves to CLOSED status. Nursing homes have all submitted testing plans and are conducting routine testing of staff and residents to detect COVID-19 early and decrease the spread in these congregate settings.

Und der müssen wir uns stellen. So wie Richard Reisen, Ex-Wachmann, Buchdesigner, und Fotograf. Noch bis 30. August wird seine Ausstellung 'Übergangsheim Schiessstraße \u2013 Fotografien zwischen Flur und Pforte' im Stadtmuseum Düsseldorf präsentiert; kuratiert von Wolfgang Zurborn.\n\nIhre Bilder von Flüchtlingen und Migranten von 1989 in einem Übergangsheim in Düsseldorf-Heerdt 'erfüllen alle Kriterien dessen, was man in der Ethnologie und der Soziologie eine teilnehmende Beobachtung' nennt. Sie sind 'gleichermaßen historisch wie aktuell', so Prof. Rolf Sachsse. Wie haben Sie es geschafft, als respekteinflößender Wachmann, der Sie damals waren, Vertrauen zu wohl eher verängstigten und verunsicherten Menschen aufzubauen? - Ich bin und war nie Respekt einflößend, zumindest ist das nicht die Art Respekt, die ich mir wünsche. Das alles hat wohl eher mit Machtausübung zu tun und das ist mir zuwider. Die Menschen die dort wohnten, hatten viel erlebt und durchlitten und waren mir an Erfahrung weit überlegen. Das war die Creme, das sind die Survivors, die es schaffen hier anzukommen. Da bin ich ein Weichei dagegen\u2026 Also der Respekt war ganz meinerseits. Zudem konnte ich mit dem einzigen Telefon aufwarten und den Jungs das Leben damit etwas angenehmer machen. Empathie wird eben erwidert und ich fand es spannend, immer neue Leute kennen zu lernen, in deren Leben ich mich einfühlen durfte.\n\nEin Laie würde kaum erkennen, dass das 'Totschlagen von Zeit durch Haareschneiden, Rauchen, Telefonieren, Herumhängen' eher Höhepunkte im Zusammenleben von Migranten darstellen: wie konnten Sie diese Situationen so aufnehmen, als wären sie 'noch nie vorher gesehen worden'?\nWenn Rolf Sachsse das schreibt, ist das ein großes Kompliment. Ich bin allerdings mit den Bildern auch in einer vergleichsfreien Situation, weil ich zumindest bei meinen Recherchen nichts zum Thema in der Zeit gefunden habe. Für mich bot die Situation die Möglichkeit, mich täglich zu entfremden. Ich war jeden Tag wie im Ausland und abends dann wieder zuhause um meine Filme zu entwickeln.

It is not inherited. And oftentimes, greatness isn't appreciated or recognised until you see greatness anywhere no more\u2063.\n\u2063\n🤫The secret of greatness lies within you. There is no discrimination from God. Anybody can be great. You have the formula of greatness inside you. It depends on you if you want to be great. If you want to be great, you can be great.\u2063\n\u2063\nThat secret recipe of greatness is inside you. There are so many souls inside you. Nothing is out of your reach. When you reach God, you will be at the pinnacle of your journey. That is the culmination.\u2063\n\u2063\nGreatness is not inherited.\u2063\n\u2063\n👨\u200D✈️ If your father is a pilot, do you assume you will be a pilot all by yourself, without any training or education? If your father is a great batsman, do you think you'll be a great batsman without making any effort? Why then do people think that if the father is a saint of God, then the son or daughter will be a saint of God too?\u2063\n\u2063\n❤️You will be a saint of God if God wants you to be his friend. It depends on God and you. Your family is not involved; the decision is taken by God. If God is willing, he will accept you as a friend. \u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n#alratv #goharshahi #younusalgohar #sufi #sufism #agapelove #saint #fate #divinelove #lovequotes #divine #purification #compassion #greatness #selfesteem #selfimprovement #creation #Nirvana #higherself #theself #happiness #motivation #UniversalSufi #hope #socialdistance #hope #strength #positiveenergy #enlightenment #evolve","NumberOfLikes":1,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Tehzeeb on August 13, 2020.

If one of the kids went into the gate of the pasture and the other walked along the outside instead, we'd end up trapped on one side or the other. We were just a few feet apart, but still not quite together. The barbs were a small, but effective way to separate us. These days of weathering through a pandemic with a world of social distancing, we can often find ourselves a bit apart from one another, like bunnies on different sides of a barbed wire fence. And though, I may not have the urge to touch noses like bunnies might, hugs are still something that I miss most of all these days. I would have never thought that six feet of distance would feel like a mile, but I now realize that it can. This too shall pass one day, though, and we can thankfully connect in so many virtual ways.

I\u2019ve seen many moms talking about how difficult distance learning is, all the extra work & having to teach everything themselves, is hard. Everyone wants schools to open because its important. But the matter of fact is- it isn\u2019t going to be back to normal for a while. So the best we can do, is to let the reality set in. Focus on your next step. I have been handling this much better than I expected. And I\u2019m doing so because I\u2019ve decided not to let the stress get to me. Schooling is important, but there\u2019s also a lot that goes along with that. Mental & physical health, especially. Making sure your kids are physically active, that they get enough rest, enough social interaction & are mentally healthy is SO important. So many parents are putting a lot more pressure on their kids-and it\u2019s already hard enough. Distanced learning is going to be hard & I feel the best way to make sure your kids are going to succeed is by making sure your kids are happy and healthy. This is a difficult time for them too, and they are just kids! So many will fall behind in school because of the stress. That\u2019s just how it is right now. What\u2019s important is Mental & physical health, Social interaction (mental health) Get these kids to FaceTime with friends after school. Make it a priority. & Set a realistic schedule. It might take a week or two to get the hang of your schedule especially if you have more than one kid at home. Make sure your kids are retaining the information that they are learning. Because that\u2019s all that REALLY matters. Get the assignments done the best you can. But as long as you are keeping your kids mentally happy...learning & retaining the information WILL come easier than if they feel this huge amount of stress. What matters is that they are LEARNING.

It is fertile ground; the place where children strengthen social bonds, build emotional maturity, develop cognitive skills, and shore up their physical health. 💚⠀\n⠀\nKids know intuitively that play time is essential. Many teachers and parents also understand that it\u2019s crucial for a child\u2019s proper development. And increasingly, science is supporting this argument.⠀\nFor example, The Atlantic article refers to studies stating that free unstructured play helps children develop self-regulation skills, which helps them calm themselves and focus in class.⠀\nWe know that both structured activities and free play are essential for kids\u2019 proper development. But times have changed and for so many of us, with both parents working, there is often no other option but to program children with camps and activities during the summer. So how can we make sure that our kids get their unstructured time? 🌻⠀\n⠀\nHere are some suggestions:⠀\nMake frequent trips to the playground and let your kids take risks⠀\nVisit farms, forests, and ravines where kids can explore nature⠀\nBecome a play angel so your kids will have a safe environment for kid-led play⠀\nChoose a camp that values free play and discovery time for kids⠀\nStart a Parent Club with a group of friends⠀\nMake sure evenings and weekends include lots of downtime.⠀\nThough challenging, it\u2019s definitely not impossible to give kids the freedom they need during their break from the school year. How do you make sure your kids have time for free play?⠀\n⠀\nhttps:\/\/buff.ly\/33ybDGV","NumberOfLikes":19,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Champions for Life Foundation on August 13, 2020.

This is part two of our two part series with @askmrswatts all about sex education! In part two, we focus on her small groups with parents and how educating their kids brings up a lot of questions and insecurities about sex of their own. Especially in a more conservative, Christian environment. We talk about how the \u201CBulls\u201D and the \u201Celephants\u201D should be added to the birds and bees conversation and tools for parents to create a more open and accepting environment. As some of us have kids, are thinking about having children or know people with children, this episode applies to us all! Our talk is fascinating, I know you will enjoy it.

Why not make that letter a greeting card? And why not make that greeting card a #finkelsteinoriginal ?\nAlso, it doesn\u2019t have to be a Father\u2019s Day card either. Other cards to celebrate a guiding person in your life can also be created.

Why? When someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain viruses. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets or even virus if the person has the disease.''\n\nWith Keepa, when kids are not at a safe social distance in public🚎, they'll receive warnings from their Keepa. This will help kids make a habit of keeping a safe social distance. Keepa is integrated with 3 alert modes and comes with a wrist strap and lanyard for ease of use. kids can switch different alert modes and decide how to wear it as they like, making it more like a cute toy watch that is appealing to kids than a common alarm⏰. \n\n📋Learn more: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2DNluy6\n.\n.\n.\n.\n. \n#covidsafe #backtoschool #backtoschool2020 #schoolbegins #handwashing #socialdistance #socialdistancing","NumberOfLikes":8,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by TinkerGen | STEM Education on August 13, 2020.

Children are much more likely to learn a skill when practicing it, even in role play situations, rather than simply hearing about it.  This is where social stories often fail.  While they may explain how to social distance in school or the community, research has shown that the key to success isn\u2019t just reading or hearing about what to do, but to actually do it.  In Behavioral Skills Training, role play is often used in the beginning because you can control so much of the situation.  Here are some examples of activities that may help a child learn social distancing at a foundational level.#socialdistance #socialdistancing #abc #abcforautism #ABA #safe\n\nTo see the eight steps in its entirety, please click the link in our bio.","NumberOfLikes":0,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Applied Behavior Center on August 12, 2020.
