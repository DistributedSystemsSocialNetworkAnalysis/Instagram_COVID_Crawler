If you\u2019re still using these \u2013 and not LinkedIn \u2013 you\u2019ve fallen behind your peers. This is the class to get you social media savvy, so you can get the job of your dreams and more money in your pocket. Who doesn\u2019t want that? 🤔\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n· Do you use LinkedIn every day, multiple times a day?\n· Do you know what LinkedIn employees say about how to use the About section?\n· Do you share content frequently?\n· Do you have the coveted \u201C500+\u201D connections?\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nIf you answered NO to ANY of these questions, then this workshop is for you.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nFor entrepreneurs: Coach and Motivational Speaker Russ Terry has built a consistent 6-figure business, and more than half of that revenue comes directly from LinkedIn! If you're an entrepreneur who wants to generate more income, we highly recommend you attend this informative webinar.

The results in my confidence levels are incomparable.\n\n1️\u20E3 The 1st picture was taken in January, 2020. I was off the beer with 2 weeks and only beginning my latest journey. I was pretty miserable at this time and trying my hardest to drag myself out of the hole I'd found myself in. Getting to the gym alone was a major accomishment. \n\nI always remember how I felt on that day. I was so anxious. My confidence levels were at rock bottom and I was so paranoid that everyone was judging me. I was very uncomfortable the whole time. But, I always remeber thinking, 'I'm never going to feel this way again'. It was like ⛽ to the 🔥. From that moment, I knew I'd have to work my ass off to get into shape.\n\n2️\u20E3 This photo was taken 8 months later. Last Friday, August 14th to be exact. It was the first time I'd been into a gym in 6 months and I've not lifed a weight within that time frame. Pure cadio, alcohol free and inprovements on my diet was the magic formula. \n\nI felt so confident. I felt like a bad ass. I felt proud. I felt a level of accomplisment. The transformation had really occurred and I'd surpassed all my goals.\n\nEveryone has to start somewhere. Everyone's weight loss and health journey begins with a decision. A decision to change. The next thing is to take action and go workout. Get your body active. By getting active alone, you'll notice huge differences in your mental health. And then, work hard. Stay consistent and trust in the process. Hard work will yield results.","NumberOfLikes":106,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Shane Goggin - Laoch in London, United Kingdom.

We take date all the time without realizing it. Looking at the number of steps you\u2019ve taken on your Fitbit each day is data collection, weighing yourself on a scale every Saturday is data collection, and getting a grade in school is data collection. Likewise, if you want to help your child improve with social distancing, then keep track of how they do each day. Data collection may include:\n\n1) How frequently your child demonstrates social distancing correctly vs. incorrectly (Activities A,B, C, D, and F) compared to the number of opportunities or the time that has elapsed.\n\n2) How long your child demonstrates social distancing correctly (Activity E) At a minimum, keep track of the amount of success your child has each day so you can compare it to the next.

I missed visiting relatives and even just picnic-ing by the river with family. We had to adjust our routines and make mask wearing a norm.\n\nI started sewing to entertain my mind, and teaching my six children. This was hard as I don't have the skills of a high school or primary school teacher. My 8 month old baby crawling around sure keeps me on my toes! This lockdown showed me what routinely I would be doing at home if I would have been a full time stay home mom.

Since we\u2019re in the middle of a pandemic, I know we\u2019re not going out without masks and eating inside! This was on a pier, so it was outside and there was plenty of room to be away from everyone AND we wore masks when we weren\u2019t eating. Now, to the rating. When I saw the waiter bring over the burger, I knew my taste buds and tummy would thank me for this delicious meal that I was about to bestow on them. This burger was oh so thick that I had to securely grab it with my two hands for safety measures. If you know me, you know I love a nice and crispy piece of bacon. This restaurant did not disappoint. This burger was so good that as I laid in bed that night, I found myself hoping it would appear in my dreams and ask me to my 2016 senior prom. I got a watermelon martini to celebrate watermelon sugar being @harrystyles\u2019s FIRST NUMBER ONE!!! It\u2019s all for you, king. These fries were crispy and thick and I wish I could\u2019ve taken some home and performed a whole skincare routine on them and made sure they got 8 hours of sleep. I had to include the piece of chocolate cake because it was too moist and tasty not to. Would I order it again?

While at MASS MoCA, she utilized the environment of the Berkshires as a way to heal after months of living in her Brooklyn apartment during COVID-19. She says, \u201CThis global pandemic is also compounded with an upheaval of the racist systems our country runs on. Introspection and growth comes with guilt and anxiety, and while my language is often weighty and concise, it has a tinge of humor that I carry with me. I have made plenty of work during the past two weeks vomiting words onto pages with haphazard images about protests and pandemic rules. But, it wasn\u2019t until I returned to the simplicity of landscapes and words did I feel at peace with what I was trying to say. As an artist I want to make meaningful and lasting statements of the present, but what I found here is that, when I am authentic to the work and myself- it comes easily. Forcing work to look a certain way or be a certain way owns the artist rather than the artist owning it, and I can only convey the heaviness of my \u2018now\u2019 if I am 100% behind the work.\u201D\n.\n.\n#studiosatmassmoca #artistinresidence #contemporarypainting #socialdistance #pandemicart #ownyourart","NumberOfLikes":44,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597327349,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 13 16:02:29 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Parade !!

Why? When someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain viruses. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets or even virus if the person has the disease.''\n\nWith Keepa, when kids are not at a safe social distance in public🚎, they'll receive warnings from their Keepa. This will help kids make a habit of keeping a safe social distance. Keepa is integrated with 3 alert modes and comes with a wrist strap and lanyard for ease of use. kids can switch different alert modes and decide how to wear it as they like, making it more like a cute toy watch that is appealing to kids than a common alarm⏰. \n\n📋Learn more: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2DNluy6\n.\n.\n.\n.\n. \n#covidsafe #backtoschool #backtoschool2020 #schoolbegins #handwashing #socialdistance #socialdistancing","NumberOfLikes":8,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by TinkerGen | STEM Education on August 13, 2020.

Due to the increase in COVID-19 cases the Health Officers agree that, until the COVID incidence rate decreases, in-person instruction is not safe or recommended in North Central Washington.\n\nAs of this date, based upon best available evidence, the Health Officers of Chelan, Douglas, Grant, Kittitas, and Okanogan counties support the following approach, which reflects Washington State Department of Health\nguidance:\n\n\u2022 Schools and educators must be considered \u201Cessential businesses\u201D and \u201Cessential workers\u201D\no Appropriate Personal Protective Equipment must be made available for staff and students to\nminimize risks during classroom instruction\no Appropriate funding must be made available for engineering controls to minimize risks during\nclassroom instruction\no All accommodations made for other essential businesses should be extended to schools and\neducators, inclusive of remote education continuing through any future stay home orders.\n\n\u2022 The county Health Officers do not support a return to in-person classroom instruction when the county\u2019s incidence of COVID-19 is above 75 cases per 100,000 for 2 consecutive weeks (14 days).\n\n\u2022 The county Health Officers do support a hybrid approach with K-5 and other educationally high-risk groups in-person in classrooms with COVID precautions when the county\u2019s incidence of COVID-19 is less than 75 cases per 100,000 for 2 consecutive weeks (14 days).\n\n\u2022 The county Health Officers support return to in-person classroom instruction for all student populations, with COVID-19 precautions, when the county incidence of COVID-19 is 25 cases per 100,000 for 2 consecutive weeks (14 days).\n\n\u2022 School districts may petition the local public health jurisdiction for an exception to these reopening thresholds and other standards. Such petitions should be founded in evidence, on a reasonable basis, and with supporting rationale.\n\nThe full school guidance document is located on www.okanogancountycovid19.org","NumberOfLikes":2,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Okanogan County Public Health on August 12, 2020.

Florida NEVER ceases to amaze me. \n\n#Repost @washingtonpost\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nOn Tuesday, as Florida set a daily record for covid-19 deaths, Marion County Sheriff Billy Woods prohibited his deputies from wearing masks at work. His order, which also applies to visitors to the sheriff\u2019s office, carves out an exception for officers in some locations, including hospitals, and when dealing with people who are high-risk or suspected of having the novel coronavirus. \n\nPolice nationwide have faced scrutiny over inconsistent use of masks by officers, even in large cities like New York and Philadelphia where face coverings are mandatory. Many large departments only suggest officers wear masks, ABC News recently found, while those that require them, including the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department, make exceptions for incidents where masks might impede officers in the line of duty. \n\nWoods is among the first law enforcement officials to outright ban masks for his deputies, though. The sheriff argued working mask-free hasn\u2019t led to a spike of infections in his 900-person department. \u201CSince the beginning of this pandemic the operation of this office has not changed and no wearing of masks has been put in place,\u201D he said.
