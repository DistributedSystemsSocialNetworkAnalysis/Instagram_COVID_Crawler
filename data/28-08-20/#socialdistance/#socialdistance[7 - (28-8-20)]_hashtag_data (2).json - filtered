Spread happens when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, and droplets from their mouth or nose are launched into the air and land in the mouths or noses of people nearby. The droplets can also be inhaled into the lungs. Recent studies indicate that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19. Since people can spread the virus before they know they are sick, it is important to stay at least 6 feet away from others when possible, even if you\u2014or they\u2014do not have any symptoms. Social distancing is especially important for people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.\n\n#socialdistance #covid19 #stayhealthyketchikan #stepsforahealthycommunity","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#socialdistance","#covid19","#stayhealthyketchikan","#stepsforahealthycommunity"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Ketchikan Gateway Borough on August 12, 2020.

It also helps pets sleep deeper which is SUPER helpful when staying in hotel rooms or anywhere out of place.

For one I am elated that they are heading back for in classroom learning, I sucked at being a teacher, mom, housekeeper, personal assistant, chauffeur, entertainer, short order cook, master disciplinarian, entrepreneur and business owner all at one time. I am overjoyed that we chose a school here in Florida (thank you @stmarkslionspbg ) that cares about our children\u2019s education and mental state and has taken the initiative to put into practice measurements to safely reopen. I am scared that at any moment the privilege of being in school could change beyond my control and that maybe it was selfish of me to send them off in the first place. I HATE that they have to wear masks! Today feels like 105 degrees and I was hot just taking this picture at 7:30am. I\u2019m heartbroken that Reed was so excited to pack a football for recess and I didn\u2019t have the guts to tell him football is not an approved activity in the new normal. Im worried that Lily\u2019s new backpack is too heavy from all the water bottles I had to pack because refilling at the school\u2019s water fountain has been deemed a \u201Cthreat\u201D and is unsafe according to the CDC.\n.\n.\n.\nI am sad, sad that our friends near and far are still uncertain about what their own back to school experience will look like. Angry that for so many there are no viable realistic options for their children so that they can return to their regularly scheduled programing whatever it may be (👩🏻\u200D🎓🧑\u200D🔧🧑🏽\u200D🔬🦹🏻💅🧖🏻\u200D♀️🎾🧘💃). Sad that we cannot figure out how to move forward, return to normal and combat this disease.

This is a day earmarked to celebrate the youth in the world and emphasize on the \u2018Youth Role\u2019 in ensuring a developed world.\n\nGlobally, the theme for this year's celebration is \"Youth Engagement for Global Action\" from which Ghana has adopted \u201CYouth Engagement in Mitigating the Impact of COVID-19; The Need for Innovation and Creativity.\u201D\n\nDeducing from the themes above, it is clear that the youth must be actively involved at the decision making table to drive our development through proactiveness, dedication and unfettered service.\n\nWe at NAHSAG admonish every youth to first believe in yourself and prepare adequately to rise to the occasion to serve this great nation. Les Brown once said \u2014 \u201CIt's better to be prepared for an opportunity and not have one, than to have an opportunity and not be prepared.\u201D Preparedness lies in the center of every keen and important development. So get prepared. \n\nOur forefathers have contributed their lot to bring us to our current standing, it is our time now. The future is ours and the future is now!\nArise Ghana youth for your country, for the nation demands your devotion! as sang in the youth anthem.\n\nIn the words of the most revered former United Nations Secretary General, Late Kofi Annan \u2014 If the world is yours tomorrow, you should begin to take responsibility and become engaged.

And that is certainly one reason we keep making so many foolish mistakes. To pretend to wisdom is to ignore the reality of our own shortcomings. How can we learn from our mistakes until we are wise enough to look at them clearly? Humility and self-awareness are among the prerequisites to wisdom. \u2063\n\u2063\nAction is the final essential component of wisdom. Knowledge not acted upon is merely a collection of facts. As the Sufis are fond of saying \u201C A donkey with a load of books is still a donkey.\u201D But when we act on our knowledge, we open ourselves up to wisdom. \u2063\n\u2063\nIf we listen closely to the words of the wise, and we act on them, perhaps we ourselves will one day be counted among their ranks. Then, our own words will serve to guide others.\u2063\n\u2063\n- Sufi Master @Younus_AlGohar\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n#alratv #goharshahi #younusalgohar #sufi #sufism #agapelove #destiny #poetry #divinelove #lovequotes #wisdom #poem #beloved #selflove #selfesteem #selfimprovement #wisewords #Nirvana #higherself #sufipoem #happiness #femalesufi #UniversalSufi #lover #socialdistance #selfisolation #strength #sufipoetry #enlightenment #evolve \u2063\u2063","NumberOfLikes":4,"Hashtags":["#alratv","#goharshahi","#younusalgohar","#sufi","#sufism","#agapelove","#destiny","#poetry","#divinelove","#lovequotes","#wisdom","#poem","#beloved","#selflove","#selfesteem","#selfimprovement","#wisewords","#Nirvana","#higherself","#sufipoem","#happiness","#femalesufi","#UniversalSufi","#lover","#socialdistance","#selfisolation","#strength","#sufipoetry","#enlightenment","#evolve"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597215325,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 12 08:55:25 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"seaplanetresortspa","CaptionText":"Biz hep dikkat ettik temizliğe, hijyene, sizi rahat ettirmeye ve güzel bir tatil geçirmeniz için gereken her şeye...\nWe have always paid attention to cleanliness, hygiene, comfort and everything you need to have a nice holiday...\nWir haben immer auf Sauberkeit, Hygiene, Komfort und alles geachtet, was Sie für einen schönen Urlaub brauchen...\n#wealwayspayattention #weareopen #socialdistance #iloveseaden\n#turkeyisthebestholidaychoice","NumberOfLikes":513,"Hashtags":["#wealwayspayattention","#weareopen","#socialdistance","#iloveseaden","#turkeyisthebestholidaychoice"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Seaden Sea Planet Resort & Spa in Sea Planet Resort & Spa.

It lets those around me know that I won\u2019t be putting a mask on. \n\nI don\u2019t have to wear it or explain myself due to HIPAA privacy but I realize there are people who are immunocompromised or in the high risk demographic of elderly people and it\u2019s just polite to let them know. \n\nIf I\u2019m entering a privately owned business, I stop at the door and ask if I\u2019m allowed to come in. If they say no, I smile and say thank you and leave. \n\nIf I\u2019m entering a state owned building like a post office, a library, or the DMV then I don\u2019t ask permission. Our taxes pay for these services and they can\u2019t deny them. If they choose to call the police, it\u2019s a waste of time and resources. But there isn\u2019t a law that can force anyone to wear a mask in public. \n\nWhen I do enter a building, I stay 6 feet away from everyone. I don\u2019t do this for myself. I do this for them. And the whole time I think about how sad it is to live in fear and treat healthy people as though they\u2019re sick.\n\nIf you want this lanyard, you can email \nfreeandhealthylanyards@gmail.com.

We cooked our food items at home the day before we left:\n\nSteamed rice and quinoa, stewed yellow squash & onions, crumbled seasoned tofu, roasted asparagus, bok choy, mushrooms, and a mix of snow peas, onions and mushrooms. \n\nWe packaged each food item separately in zip lock bags; and loaded into our cooler  we also packed fresh green onions & cilantro.\n\nAbout 2 hours to our destination, we pulled over and put the squash and onions into one pyrex and the mix of snow peas, mushrooms and onions into the other along with some of the bok choy.... plugged it into the inverter and lunch was nice and ready when we got to the campground.\n\nOur other hot meals (we ate fruit & chia pudding for breakfast... and had chickpea salad and hummus as other meal options) were grain bowls using the prepared veggies:\n\nUsing each pyrex as a bowl, place the grain in bottom of pyrex, the quinoa seemed fine as is, but I recommend adding just a splash of water to the rice, then the tofu and other ingredients, plug in for 2 hrs or so.\n\nWhen done, add chopped green onions, cilantro, seeds, nuts, and condiments (we like Maggi, sesame oil, & Laoganmao).\n\nWe were very pleased with our first trip using the Hot Logic!\n\n#myhotlogic \n\n#veggieheavykitchen #vegan\n#vegansofinstagram #vegansofig \n#veganfoodshare \n#veganfoodisgoodfood \n#veganhomecooking\n\n#plantbased #plantbaseddiet\n\n#wanderingsouthernvegan\n#stlouis #stlouisvegan \n\n #washyourhands \n#socialdistance #wearamask\n#coronavirus #pandemic\n#covid19 \n\n#rvlife #rv #socialdistancetravel\n\n#loveyourneighbor\n#seekjustice","NumberOfLikes":13,"Hashtags":["#myhotlogic","#veggieheavykitchen","#vegan","#vegansofinstagram","#vegansofig","#veganfoodshare","#veganfoodisgoodfood","#veganhomecooking","#plantbased","#plantbaseddiet","#wanderingsouthernvegan","#stlouis","#stlouisvegan","#washyourhands","#socialdistance","#wearamask","#coronavirus","#pandemic","#covid19","#rvlife","#rv","#socialdistancetravel","#loveyourneighbor","#seekjustice"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Veggie Heavy Kitchen in Meremac Springs.

Wash your hands with your child to show him or her how it's done. \n\nTo prevent rushing, suggest washing hands for as long as it takes to sing the \"Happy Birthday\" song twice. If your child can't reach the sink on his or her own, keep a step stool handy.\n\nBe sure to supervise young children using alcohol-based hand sanitizers.

It is not inherited. And oftentimes, greatness isn't appreciated or recognised until you see greatness anywhere no more\u2063.\n\u2063\n🤫The secret of greatness lies within you. There is no discrimination from God. Anybody can be great. You have the formula of greatness inside you. It depends on you if you want to be great. If you want to be great, you can be great.\u2063\n\u2063\nThat secret recipe of greatness is inside you. There are so many souls inside you. Nothing is out of your reach. When you reach God, you will be at the pinnacle of your journey. That is the culmination.\u2063\n\u2063\nGreatness is not inherited.\u2063\n\u2063\n👨\u200D✈️ If your father is a pilot, do you assume you will be a pilot all by yourself, without any training or education? If your father is a great batsman, do you think you'll be a great batsman without making any effort? Why then do people think that if the father is a saint of God, then the son or daughter will be a saint of God too?\u2063\n\u2063\n❤️You will be a saint of God if God wants you to be his friend. It depends on God and you. Your family is not involved; the decision is taken by God. If God is willing, he will accept you as a friend. \u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n#alratv #goharshahi #younusalgohar #sufi #sufism #agapelove #saint #fate #divinelove #lovequotes #divine #purification #compassion #greatness #selfesteem #selfimprovement #creation #Nirvana #higherself #theself #happiness #motivation #UniversalSufi #hope #socialdistance #hope #strength #positiveenergy #enlightenment #evolve","NumberOfLikes":3,"Hashtags":["#alratv","#goharshahi","#younusalgohar","#sufi","#sufism","#agapelove","#saint","#fate","#divinelove","#lovequotes","#divine","#purification","#compassion","#greatness","#selfesteem","#selfimprovement","#creation","#Nirvana","#higherself","#theself","#happiness","#motivation","#UniversalSufi","#hope","#socialdistance","#hope","#strength","#positiveenergy","#enlightenment","#evolve"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Noori Noori on August 10, 2020.

In total, the island nation of 5 million people has reported 22 coronavirus deaths. While other countries \u2014 including Pacific neighbor Australia and the United States \u2014 continue to battle outbreaks, New Zealand has been held up as an example of how to fight Covid-19. New Zealand's strategy was simple: in the words of Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, the country had to \"go hard, and go early.\" When Ardern closed the border to foreigners on March 19, the country only had 28 confirmed cases. And when she announced a nationwide lockdown on March 23, there were only 102 confirmed cases, and no deaths.

We both brought finger foods to try and share along with the dips. @wheresrubytoday made the most adorable finger foods and separated them out using silicone cupcake liners - such a great idea for little hands!\n\nI brought cheerios and a few toys to keep Maxine, my 10-month-old busy. I also brought little notebooks and colored pencils for Ruby and Eisley to play with when they were finished eating. \n\nIt was nice to get together with another human even for just a short outing!

I don\u2019t like to broadcast my personal life on here, but I just hope that what I have to say has any level of impact. I\u2019m preparing for September but I\u2019m scared. Really really scared. I\u2019m clinically extremely vulnerable to critical illness if I contract COVID-19, I may not look it but I am. I\u2019m also a teacher, who is desperate to go back to work but also terrified because masks or distancing are not a thing in UK gov guidelines for returning to school. Yes, I can have my own risk assessment. Yes, if I need to shield again I can, but this is not the point. I\u2019m now allowed to stop shielding and leave the house after isolating completely since March, but I just don\u2019t want to. Everywhere I turn I see people without masks, not distancing, hugging people not in their household and basically behaving as if covid is not a problem anymore or dangerous anymore. For many people it may not be, but I need these numbers to go down. For me and many others who have been on full lockdown all this time where you haven\u2019t been, this actually is life and death and it is hurting all our hearts to see how little people care. Please, socially distance for me and everyone else in my position. Let us get back to work without feeling terrified.
