For one I am elated that they are heading back for in classroom learning, I sucked at being a teacher, mom, housekeeper, personal assistant, chauffeur, entertainer, short order cook, master disciplinarian, entrepreneur and business owner all at one time. I am overjoyed that we chose a school here in Florida (thank you @stmarkslionspbg ) that cares about our children\u2019s education and mental state and has taken the initiative to put into practice measurements to safely reopen. I am scared that at any moment the privilege of being in school could change beyond my control and that maybe it was selfish of me to send them off in the first place. I HATE that they have to wear masks! Today feels like 105 degrees and I was hot just taking this picture at 7:30am. I\u2019m heartbroken that Reed was so excited to pack a football for recess and I didn\u2019t have the guts to tell him football is not an approved activity in the new normal. Im worried that Lily\u2019s new backpack is too heavy from all the water bottles I had to pack because refilling at the school\u2019s water fountain has been deemed a \u201Cthreat\u201D and is unsafe according to the CDC.\n.\n.\n.\nI am sad, sad that our friends near and far are still uncertain about what their own back to school experience will look like. Angry that for so many there are no viable realistic options for their children so that they can return to their regularly scheduled programing whatever it may be (👩🏻\u200D🎓🧑\u200D🔧🧑🏽\u200D🔬🦹🏻💅🧖🏻\u200D♀️🎾🧘💃). Sad that we cannot figure out how to move forward, return to normal and combat this disease.

This is a day earmarked to celebrate the youth in the world and emphasize on the \u2018Youth Role\u2019 in ensuring a developed world.\n\nGlobally, the theme for this year's celebration is \"Youth Engagement for Global Action\" from which Ghana has adopted \u201CYouth Engagement in Mitigating the Impact of COVID-19; The Need for Innovation and Creativity.\u201D\n\nDeducing from the themes above, it is clear that the youth must be actively involved at the decision making table to drive our development through proactiveness, dedication and unfettered service.\n\nWe at NAHSAG admonish every youth to first believe in yourself and prepare adequately to rise to the occasion to serve this great nation. Les Brown once said \u2014 \u201CIt's better to be prepared for an opportunity and not have one, than to have an opportunity and not be prepared.\u201D Preparedness lies in the center of every keen and important development. So get prepared. \n\nOur forefathers have contributed their lot to bring us to our current standing, it is our time now. The future is ours and the future is now!\nArise Ghana youth for your country, for the nation demands your devotion! as sang in the youth anthem.\n\nIn the words of the most revered former United Nations Secretary General, Late Kofi Annan \u2014 If the world is yours tomorrow, you should begin to take responsibility and become engaged. Tomorrow begins today. It is up to you now, it is your world now, go out and make a difference. \n\nHappy International Youth Day, Young Compatriots! \n\n#StaySafe #WashHands #SocialDistance #WearAMask \n\nNAHSAG: United for Health!\n______________________________________\n\nSigned by:\nOduro Elijah Yaw Konadu\n(Coordinating Secretary)\n+233(0)50-219-5319\n\nSanctioned by:\nMoses N.

I did everything to negate and purify my Lower Self. I spent hours upon hours in hardcore, physical worship. But it didn't really help much in purifying the Lower Self. The ego was always bending towards negativity. The ego didn't seem to be affected by any hardcore worship. \u2063\n\u2063\n✨The moment I started to accumulate love for my Master, HDE Gohar Shahi - it was the first beam of love that crushed my ego. Nothing is more constructive in terms of cleansing and purifying the Lower Self; no worship is as effective as love is.\u2063\n\u2063\nThese were my findings.\u2063\n\u2063\n❣️💥True love will crush the idol of your ego.\u2063\n\u2063\nThis is true whether your heart is filled with true love either for God or for any human being.

And that is certainly one reason we keep making so many foolish mistakes. To pretend to wisdom is to ignore the reality of our own shortcomings.

Humility and self-awareness are among the prerequisites to wisdom. \u2063\n\u2063\nAction is the final essential component of wisdom. Knowledge not acted upon is merely a collection of facts. As the Sufis are fond of saying \u201C A donkey with a load of books is still a donkey.\u201D But when we act on our knowledge, we open ourselves up to wisdom. \u2063\n\u2063\nIf we listen closely to the words of the wise, and we act on them, perhaps we ourselves will one day be counted among their ranks.

First, I\u2019m sorry po sa mga nag iinquire, hindi parin po kami tumatanggap ng cake & pastry orders until now dahil sa Covid. For safety purposes nagstrikto po kami dito sa bahay lalo na kasi may baby. Movement restrictions po talaga in & out ng mga tao, things, food items and even pets. We practice certain disinfection procedures blah blah. Sabi nga nila better safe than sorry. We even closed our store and the catering doesn\u2019t accept clients for full service yet. Hassle ang Covid na to. Magppost nalang po muna kami ng mga homemade goodies (not for sale) and \u201Cwill try\u201D to include the recipe that we\u2019ve tested. We\u2019ve been making homemade stuff for personal consumption (at snack ng carwash staff) this quarantine kasi nga stay-at-home diba, lalabas lang pag importante talaga. For the record, 5x naman na ako lumalabas ng gate ever since quarantine started. 4 were doctors\u2019 appointments and one was when I inserted an I.V. line to my cousin during an emergency. Only one person in our household goes out to buy stuff and usually do it in bulk. We\u2019ll keep it at that until Covid dissipate or a potent drug\/vaccine arrive.\n\nI can\u2019t believe that this is real life. As early as February this Covid made me uneasy already.

Just wearing the PPEs alone esp the hazmat suit whole shift is uncomfortable. Let us stay home & stay safe. Let\u2019s go out only when it\u2019s really NECESSARY. Most of all, let us continue to fervently PRAY PRAY PRAY for Divine intervention so we can ease back to normal. Soon. \nKeep safe.🌻\n\nPS.

These quaint little features, called \"buchette del vino,\" date back centuries - some to the medieval ages - and now they're making a comeback thanks, oddly enough, to the covid-19 pandemic. \n\nOriginally they were used as an ingenious way for merchants to safely continue to sell wine to the working class during the Plague, allowing for wine to be passed through the wall while avoiding direct contact with clients. It seems that a handful of them have been restored to their original socially-distant glory!\n \nNearly 300 of these adorable wee windows have been cataloged across Tuscany by the Associazione Buchette del Vino. Those that have reopened are reportedly serving not just wine, but other treats and beverages such as coffee, cocktails, and gelato. Who else is thinking of having one of these installed on their house for optimal quarantine wine delivery?? 🙋\n\n#VinSocial #VinSocialite #Wine2thepeople #travelthroughtheglass #WineWindow #socialdistance #winewin #passthewine #pandemic #covid19 #quarantine #grape2glass #wine #winelover #sharethelove #wineclub #winetime #wineducation #wineplease #winery #drinkwine #storybehindthewine #lovewine #winetasting #instawine #winestagram","NumberOfLikes":53,"Hashtags":["#VinSocial","#VinSocialite","#Wine2thepeople","#travelthroughtheglass","#WineWindow","#socialdistance","#winewin","#passthewine","#pandemic","#covid19","#quarantine","#grape2glass","#wine","#winelover","#sharethelove","#wineclub","#winetime","#wineducation","#wineplease","#winery","#drinkwine","#storybehindthewine","#lovewine","#winetasting","#instawine","#winestagram"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by VIN SOCIAL on August 11, 2020.

Very simply put, you need to draft Hurst if you punt on the TE position until late in your respective draft. He\u2019s being selected as the 13th TE on average. That\u2019s insane value for someone who will slide into the very promising Hooper role. He\u2019s an overall better player than Hooper as well in my opinion. \nHurst\u2019s stats haven\u2019t ever been gaudy, and despite playing in 13 games he posted career highs in targets, yards, receptions, and touchdowns. For his career, he\u2019s accumulated 43 receptions, 512 yards, and three touchdowns. But remember, he hasn\u2019t had the opportunity to break out because he\u2019s always been mixed up in that great Ravens TE room.

In total, the island nation of 5 million people has reported 22 coronavirus deaths. While other countries \u2014 including Pacific neighbor Australia and the United States \u2014 continue to battle outbreaks, New Zealand has been held up as an example of how to fight Covid-19. New Zealand's strategy was simple: in the words of Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, the country had to \"go hard, and go early.\" When Ardern closed the border to foreigners on March 19, the country only had 28 confirmed cases. And when she announced a nationwide lockdown on March 23, there were only 102 confirmed cases, and no deaths.

It is not inherited. And oftentimes, greatness isn't appreciated or recognised until you see greatness anywhere no more\u2063.\n\u2063\n🤫The secret of greatness lies within you. There is no discrimination from God. Anybody can be great. You have the formula of greatness inside you. It depends on you if you want to be great. If you want to be great, you can be great.\u2063\n\u2063\nThat secret recipe of greatness is inside you. There are so many souls inside you. Nothing is out of your reach.

Almost 15 years ago, I was a nervous, shy, little boy who just moved to a new city in a new province, at a new school. I only knew one other person, and I was not the best at talking to new people and making new friends. Along came a kind, smiling strawberry haired boy who asked me the one question I was dying to hear that day: \u201CYou\u2019re new here, do you want to be my friend?\u201D In that one moment of kindness our friendship was born, and we quickly found out how much we had in common, from having 3 siblings, even if you were the youngest boy and I was the oldest, amazing parents, and not living in the same area as everyone else. All those nights playing Halo, Gears of War, World of Warcraft, Army of Two, making nachos, and you\u2019re one of the few who came to Magog for boating, the lake, \u201Cclubbing\u201D at the Liquor Store, Shave2Save, rugby 🏉. All those silly moments at Selwyn House like the bat 🦇 in math class, the answer on the test was 4. And of course the infamous Bike Camp, long live the pyramid. And how could we forget all the delicious Dic Ann\u2019s of course 🤤. You always pushed me to work out when I should have, so I guess it\u2019s better late than never that I am finally catching up. Thank you for being there for me during this final weight loss, you helped me more than you know. And this brings us to your engagement. Elisa, as you can tell, I\u2019m a little biased, but you found an amazing guy. And from what Joey tells me and the few times we have hung out (which I will fix by coming to Montreal more often) he is just as lucky if not luckier. Thank you for being there for him when I wasn\u2019t, because despite everything I wrote,we drifted apart over the years, but we got right back on track as if no time had passed. Congratulations, thank you again, I was honoured to be a part of the celebration last week, and again I wish you and Elisa the very best.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#tothemax #engagement #letsgo #model #nofilter #raw #bestfriend #bestfriends #shesaidyes #celebration #family #training #friends #friendship #gamer #greek #italian #socialdistance #bff #goodcompany #bromance #bikecamp #halo #gaming #newlyengaged #bestfriendsforever #throwback #highschool #montreal #love","NumberOfLikes":61,"Hashtags":["#tothemax","#engagement","#letsgo","#model","#nofilter","#raw","#bestfriend","#bestfriends","#shesaidyes","#celebration","#family","#training","#friends","#friendship","#gamer","#greek","#italian","#socialdistance","#bff","#goodcompany","#bromance","#bikecamp","#halo","#gaming","#newlyengaged","#bestfriendsforever","#throwback","#highschool","#montreal","#love"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":8,"Timestamp":1597098991,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 11 00:36:31 CEST 2020","Location":"Montreal, Quebec"},{"Owner":"sleekshopcom","CaptionText":"We are passionate about safety and protecting our customers!

As Central America\u2019s most unequal country, with a poverty level of 68 percent, 60 percent of Honduras' population works in the informal sector, with no secure form of employment.\n⠀\n👉  With about one million Hondurans living outside the country, the economy relies heavily on remittances from its diaspora, most of which reside in the United States and Spain. Last year, remittances made up 21.4 per cent of GDP.\n⠀\nIntuitive and informed economic predictions have suggested that remittances to the Central American country would crash during the crisis, but this has not been the case. Payments have in fact increased compared to the same period in 2019, after a dip earlier this year.\n⠀\n😍 With regards to aid in the form of remittances and other support, diasporic organizations have provided a great deal of help. Informal efforts such as @unidos.por.honduras, have been incredibly successful.\n⠀\n🔥🔥 These impacts are contrary to what experts would have predicted and are not consistent with trends elsewhere in the world.\n⠀\nTogether we can make much more! Our goal is to help them achieve self- sufficiency and environmental sustainability through cooperation, empowerment, and skills and tools needed for long-term success.\n⠀\n#covid19 #worldhealthorganization #Honduras #socialdistance #coronapandemic #covıd #covid19usa #socialdistancing2020 #pandemic #WHO #caribbean #latinamerica #sustainabledevelopmentgoals #globalgoals #coronavirus #caribbean #bettercommunities #YouCanDoItToo #betterworld #sdg #sdgs #sustainabledevelopmentgoals #endpoverty #nopoverty #makeithappen","NumberOfLikes":4,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#worldhealthorganization","#Honduras","#socialdistance","#coronapandemic","#covıd","#covid19usa","#socialdistancing2020","#pandemic","#WHO","#caribbean","#latinamerica","#sustainabledevelopmentgoals","#globalgoals","#coronavirus","#caribbean","#bettercommunities","#YouCanDoItToo","#betterworld","#sdg","#sdgs","#sustainabledevelopmentgoals","#endpoverty","#nopoverty","#makeithappen"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ForBetter Community on August 10, 2020.
