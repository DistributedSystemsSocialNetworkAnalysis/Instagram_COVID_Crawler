But if visiting between mid-April through mid-to-end July, definitely consider a stop in this coastal, northern county spot for some of the area's sweetest and freshest strawberries. 🍓\n\u2022\nStarting in mid April, the @carlsbadstrawberrycompany tends to kickstart the season by initially opening its strawberry stand locations. Typically, you can buy boxes of pre-picked strawberries here starting at 9 am. The stands generally close once the daily supply is sold out.\n\u2022\nAround mid May, the @carlsbadstrawberrycompany then opens their main harvest fields to the public, where you can enjoy the classic, past-time activity of strawberry picking. If you\u2019re lucky you\u2019ll also pick an evening with a vibrant red sunset.\n\u2022\nWhile this experience may be new to tourists, it's a fairly well known activity for most San Diego locals. This is largely due to the fact that this family-owned company has been in operation for the past four generations. \n\u2022\nConveniently, the strawberry fields are located only a few blocks from The Flower Fields at Carlsbad Ranch - another must-see destination. This iconic Carlsbad location is home to a variety of flowers known as the Tecolote® Giant Ranunculus, more commonly known as the Persian Buttercup or Ranunculus Asiatic. 🌸🌼\n\u2022\nWhile the flower fields are open every year from March 1st through May 10th (Mother's Day), the \"peak\" season is generally between mid-March through mid-April. Despite the above, if you want to be able to both see the flowers and pick the strawberries, we would definitely recommend going around early to mid-May. \n\u2022\nIf you have additional information, tips, or stories from your trip here, please share and comment below! 💬\n\u2022\n🇺🇸 Destination: #carlsbadstrawberryfields\n📸 Photographer: @marianaamerlos\n🔎 Source: @carlsbadstrawberrycompany\n🔎 Source: @the_flower_fields\n🌎 Wanderer: @jernemarie\n✨ Ready to be featured?\n1️\u20E3 Follow @wnwtravel\n2️\u20E3 Tag @wnwtravel\n3️\u20E3 Use #WanderNotWonder\n\u2022\nWNWxUSA\nWNWxCalifornia","NumberOfLikes":409,"Hashtags":["#carlsbadstrawberryfields","#WanderNotWonder"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Wander Not Wonder in Carlsbad Strawberry Company with @marianaamerlos, @the_flower_fields, @jernemarie, @carlsbadstrawberrycompany, and @wnwtravel.

They are often depicted walking off a cliff with a tsunami-like wave rolling in the distance. Symbolically, The Fool represents deep trust or faith in the universe, spontaneity, and a new phase. They have pure intentions and travel lightly. When in reverse (if drawn upsidedown) it can represent recklessness, self-sabotage, pessimism, and impulsive behavior. \n\u2022\u2022\u2022\nMasks and gloves along with the regular plastic bags, fast-food items, and cigarette butts are scattered on busy roads. I see people of all races at one gas station talking and laughing without their masks. I see some social distancing in generally white neighborhoods when neighbors run into each other with their cute dogs. I see people look past me and keep their distance on the street, but in the park, they don't mind as much. I can't seem to smile through this mask. I can't seem to feel the same human connection I once felt at a concert or in public spaces. Now if I stand too close I'm essentially a murderer. My fleeting opinions or thoughts are forever cemented on the internet. A pinhole-sized camera on my iPhone watches me change clothes, a few moments later Instagram flashes an ad for a new bra. Racists, pedophiles, and Christians keep quiet these days. SJW's are the new preachers. The Tik-Tok generation dances their way into a meme filled apocalypse. But isn't \"the end\" a new beginning?

The short answer is NO. This is a piece I put together after my first visit in May. According to Dr. Yang, infectious disease specialist @ucla , there is no real point in getting an antibody test right now except for research purposes or personal curiosity. He reiterated that again recently, when I went back and learned the study results, which were recently published in @nejm . The study found a rapid decline of antibodies in people who had mild #covid19. I started with 1\/4 of the amount of someone who had a high antibody count and would be a good convalescent plasma donor, and it has gone down every month since then. (I\u2019ve done 3 monthly blood draws total) They are also studying other parts of the immune response, so it\u2019s going to be super interesting to learn more.

Each muffin should clock in around 230-250 calories based on 10 servings according to @myfitnesspal \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#strongopinion #socialdistancecooking #socialdistance #quarantinecooking #homemade #bakerlife #baking #muffins #banananutmuffin #food #nomnom #delicious #breakfast #instafoodie #foodgram #homecooking #homecook #homebaker","NumberOfLikes":14,"Hashtags":["#strongopinion","#socialdistancecooking","#socialdistance","#quarantinecooking","#homemade","#bakerlife","#baking","#muffins","#banananutmuffin","#food","#nomnom","#delicious","#breakfast","#instafoodie","#foodgram","#homecooking","#homecook","#homebaker"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Lianne McDonnell-Kruger on August 08, 2020.

Door de huidige omstandigheden ben ik veel plekjes in Nederland nog meer gaan waarderen. De afgelopen maanden gaven ook ruimte, tijd en vooral aanleiding tot bezinning. We zijn echt zo gewend geraakt aan luxe en hebben vaak de overtuiging dat we dingen verdienen. Vakanties verdienen we, een dagje spa verdienen we. \nZeker nadat de beperkingen van de intelligente lockdown wat zijn versoepeld, vonden mensen dat ze wel weer recht hadden op hun  jaarlijkse vakantie naar zonnige oorden. Voor wat hoort wat. Maar wat eigenlijk? De eerste weken van de intelligente lockdown vonden velen prima te pruimen; lekker rustig,  onthaasten, me-time. Sommigen durfden het zelfs een blessing te noemen, terwijl mensen vochten voor hun leven en die strijd soms verloren. Met opoffering en solidariteit had  het weinig te maken. Echte opoffering is het pas als je iets doet voor de gemeenschap, ook al raakt het gevaar je niet persoonlijk en haal je er geen voordeel uit. \nToen er zoveel niet kon, heb ik ook wel zitten balen. We zijn met zijn allen echt gaan geloven dat vakanties vanzelfsprekend zijn, dat we het nodig hebben om bij te komen en te ontspannen. Terwijl die rust echt in jezelf zit en niet per se in verre bestemmingen. Ik heb mijn geplande tripje naar Ibiza in september  geschrapt.  Al die risico's voor mezelf en anderen voor iets dat weliswaar leuk is, maar totaal overbodig.  Terug naar de foto: ik probeer dichtbij huis mooie plekjes te vinden waar ik met vrienden kan ontspannen met uiteraard de nodige aandacht voor afstand. Een afstand die ik verder juist niet voel, want zonder alle (hang naar) luxe en altijd maar overal heen willen,  blijft daar de basis: de dankbaarheid voor fijne momenten met dito mensen. #haarrijnseplas #haarrijn #utrecht #strand #reflectie #samenzijn #strandje #staycation #bezinning #bewustzijn #bewust zijn #samenzijn #zonnen #zwemmen #natuur #nederlandismooi #socialdistancing #afstand #nabijheid #socialdistance  #smile #zon #zomer #vrienden #friends","NumberOfLikes":42,"Hashtags":["#haarrijnseplas","#haarrijn","#utrecht","#strand","#reflectie","#samenzijn","#strandje","#staycation","#bezinning","#bewustzijn","#bewust","#samenzijn","#zonnen","#zwemmen","#natuur","#nederlandismooi","#socialdistancing","#afstand","#nabijheid","#socialdistance","#smile","#zon","#zomer","#vrienden","#friends"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Marieke in Haarrijnse strand.

Although I have him as a sleeper to watch out for based on his ADP and his production last year, the fantasy community is well aware of this stud. Many have him as a breakout candidate, and that\u2019s also accurate, but this post is affirming him as a sleeper for his value. \nAs a rookie last year, Johnson led the Steelers in targets (92), receptions (59), and touchdowns (5)! He was only a measly 55 yards behind JuJu for most receiving yards, and he played in all 16 games and started in 12 of them. \nIn no way am I saying he will do the same this season, as JuJu is due for an uptick in production and he has a solid rapport with Big Ben. Eric Ebron and Chase Claypool will also take away some targets. With that being said, Diontae Johnson gives his fantasy owners great upside, and could easily be a flex or low end RB2. He\u2019s great after the catch as well, so I\u2019d especially target him in PPR formats.\nThe Steelers are absolute juggernauts at producing and developing high end WR talents. They did it again with Johnson. Be excited about him this season because he\u2019s going to light it up again and show everyone last season\u2019s numbers weren\u2019t a fluke. \n\n🎥 Sports Productions (YouTube) \n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n#DiontaeJohnson  #WR2 #steelers #Pittsburgh #nfl #fantasy #YourFantasyDoctor #nflmeme #SleeperoftheWeek #FantasyHelp #breakout #wewantfootballback #COVID19 #socialdistance #SteelCurtain #BigBen #Toledo #JUJU #footballplayers #league #highlights #americanfootball #sportsclips #footballvideos #Coldweatherfootball #fantasyhelp #footballtutor #mockdrafthelp #AFCNorth","NumberOfLikes":66,"Hashtags":["#DiontaeJohnson","#WR2","#steelers","#Pittsburgh","#nfl","#fantasy","#YourFantasyDoctor","#nflmeme","#SleeperoftheWeek","#FantasyHelp","#breakout","#wewantfootballback","#COVID19","#socialdistance","#SteelCurtain","#BigBen","#Toledo","#JUJU","#footballplayers","#league","#highlights","#americanfootball","#sportsclips","#footballvideos","#Coldweatherfootball","#fantasyhelp","#footballtutor","#mockdrafthelp","#AFCNorth"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":16,"Timestamp":1596911880,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 08 20:38:00 CEST 2020","Location":"Heinz Field"},{"CaptionText":"This is what happens when you are home for so long.

This past year has taught me a lot especially with COVID, but mainly it has retaught me about \u201Cmy why\u201D. I am a nurse because I know what it feels like to be scared, to be hurt, to feel like you\u2019re alone, to not be enough, to feel like you don\u2019t belong, to not like yourself, & like you\u2019re at the end of your rope. I became a nurse because I never wanted anyone to feel any of these negative things about themself & if I could do something as simple as be kind & make someone feel like they\u2019re not alone then I have done my job. One of my fav quotes says it best, \u201CAt times the world may seem an unfriendly and sinister place, but believe that there is much more good in it than bad.

How do you meditate? How do you \u201Cunplug\u201D? Here are some ideas on how to become more present in life: ⠀\n.⠀\n🔸Create a cell phone free time in your day. Dedicate breaks of time where your cell phone is out of sight, so you can focus and truly be with people during your day. ⠀\n🔸 Silence notifications \u2013 When you are not required to answer a text, call, or email, turn your phone on silent so that you can avoid constant distraction and not be tempted to answer immediately.  Stress can be caused by the pressure felt by having to answer immediately or multi-task. ⠀\n🔸 Tune into nature \u2013 One of the best ways to ensure you are centered and engaged in the present is to be out in nature. Soaking in the sounds, getting some fresh air and sun exposure is amazing for the mind, body, and spirit.⠀\nPhoto credit: @sonialyani ⠀\n.⠀\n.⠀\n.⠀\n#hotyoga #hotyogahouston #theoriginal #acceptnosubstitutes #ihp #infernohotpilates #socialdistance #virtualconnection #letsstaytogether","NumberOfLikes":29,"Hashtags":["#hotyoga","#hotyogahouston","#theoriginal","#acceptnosubstitutes","#ihp","#infernohotpilates","#socialdistance","#virtualconnection","#letsstaytogether"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Hot Yoga Houston on August 08, 2020.

We\u2019ve convinced ourselves as a country that we really believe in liberty, and I think that\u2019s a bunch of nonsense actually...we are far less likely to fight for our freedoms.\u201D Scary times for America. When we\u2019re more frightened by someone not wearing a mask, than someone wearing one- despite factual data that it does more harm than good- we have to take a step back and evaluate the direction our country is headed. In light of COVID, our freedoms and liberty are severely threatened on a daily basis.

I needed to go or I would not have made this trip now. Now that we are home safely I feel comfortable pulling out my phone for a post. We managed to snap this pic at the top of  Zacatecas on a self timer with Masks and gloves just out of view. We stayed far - at a minimum of 20-30 feet away from other small groups at this overlook. It was a beautiful view. I love Zacatecas. However I do not recommend traveling during covid unless you are fully committing to ALL sanitizing practice in public and in private. & Knowing that traveling now days is more of an anxious feeling than a relaxing one in all cases. Parents are getting fined for children\u2019s noses showing out from the face masks. We took the risk and honestly it was frightening at times. Luckily Mexico has shoe cleaning regulations that you don\u2019t see here in the USA. So that made me feel cleaner as well. We are OCD about shoes and our dogs feet get cleaned several times a day.
