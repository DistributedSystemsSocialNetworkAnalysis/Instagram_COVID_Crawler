The body has its own memory.\n\n\"Runanubandha cannot be equated with the genetic factors that are being transmitted from parent to child. It is a physical memory of where you came from \u2013 not necessarily in terms of color of your skin, shape of your nose, how you are built, and so on. It is just that even if you as much as hold someone\u2019s hand, you develop runanubandha. This is why in India, people greet you with folded hands. They do not want to acquire runanubandha. The same applies for passing on certain substances, like salt, sesame seeds, or soil \u2013 people never take them from somebody else\u2019s hands, to avoid developing runanubandha. Since this culture is essentially oriented towards liberation, this awareness and these sensitivities are there not to build bondage in life, but to keep it only to the extent that is absolutely necessary.\" (Isha)\n\n#love #touch #knowledge #feelings #manners #instagood #instagram #life #couple #family #memory #goodvibes #art #pic #pictureoftheday #photography #distance #socialdistancing #alllivesmatter✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿 #respect #instagram #quotes #amazing #truth #energy #healing #inspiration #secrets #model #girls #bookstagram","NumberOfLikes":25,"Hashtags":["#love","#touch","#knowledge","#feelings","#manners","#instagood","#instagram","#life","#couple","#family","#memory","#goodvibes","#art","#pic","#pictureoftheday","#photography","#distance","#socialdistancing","#alllivesmatter✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿","#respect","#instagram","#quotes","#amazing","#truth","#energy","#healing","#inspiration","#secrets","#model","#girls","#bookstagram"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Ana 🕊Maria🕊 on August 28, 2020.

It\u2019s almost baffling to think that just a simple dinner with others is feeling more and more like a relic of the past. I munch into the night on potent cheeses, truffle salami and delicious dips honoring civility while cautiously holding back savagery instincts from things deprived to long. I almost was able to contain myself until the main course was served. A Guaranteed table pleaser the Surf and Turf is one of the highest regarded items on any menu. My filet mignon was cooked to a beautiful medium rare and coupled well next to my perfectly seasoned shrimp skewer. They danced between a crowd of French fry potatoes and roasted Brussel sprouts. We entered deeper into the evening and collectively tried rounding out an appropriate number of wine glasses served, the feeling of nostalgia slowly lifts. Like remnants of the past I finally sense my food Phoenix emerging from the ashes. Of course what great meal isn\u2019t complimented by dessert and espresso.

They don\u2019t aggregate in large schools and live a solitary life. They\u2019re also homebodies, so if you find one on a dive remember that spot because it will still be there when you go back years later. How do we know? These rockfish live a VERY long time. The oldest living female yelloweye rockfish found in B.C. was 121 years old! As impressive as these fish are, we unfortunately don\u2019t see as many these days due to a decline in their population that happened in the 1980s from overfishing. We are hopeful that since the implementation of rockfish conservation areas and monitoring efforts, these slow maturing fish will bounce back and increase in population numbers.\n\nHow do you know if you\u2019ve found a yelloweye rockfish on your dive survey? They are distinguished by their yellow eyes, bright red\/orange colouration on their body and black on the edges of their fins. Adults might also have a white stripe on the side of their body. As juveniles they are dark red and have two white horizontal stripes along their body.

The average price of homes sold across Canada in July 2020 was up 14.3% and new listings were up 10.3% across Canada.\n\n\u201CRemember, the April numbers were pretty much the worst ever,\u201D explained Senior Economist Shaun Cathcart during the latest edition of CREA\u2019s Housing Market Report. \u201CA lot has changed in a very short time, but obviously a big part of what we\u2019re seeing right now is the unleashing of activity that would have otherwise happened earlier this year had it not been for COVID-19 and the strict initial lockdowns.\u201D\n\nWith COVID-19 delaying the start to the typical busy spring market, traffic to REALTOR.ca has peaked in the summer months and Canada\u2019s No. 1 real estate platform had its strongest year-to-date growth in July.

Airports, planes, and hotels are cleaner than they have ever been. Companies are under the microscope right now, and are taking every single precaution to promote safety. 💚 We fly @southwestair and they are currently leaving middle seats open, which is amazing. I ALWAYS take 70% alcohol wipes and wipe out areas of the plane, and for the first time ever, my wipes aren\u2019t filthy black! They board ten at a time to prevent over crowding in the jet way and planes have some of the very best HEPA filters available. ✈️ Resorts and nice hotels are providing masks and sanitizers for guests. Plastic cups have replaced glasses in the rooms. There are signs on the remotes saying they\u2019ve been sanitized, and they\u2019re minimizing housekeeping coming in the room unless you need them. 🧳 Restaurants are different in every state, but in general, you wear a mask unless you are seated. Why? So you aren\u2019t breathing on others as you walk to your table. Tables are spaced out to allow social distancing. In Cali, you can only eat outside. These precautions have reduced the number of tables available, so plan ahead and make reservations and tip your wait staff well. 🍴 Masks are required everywhere now. Get used to them. They will be around for awhile. Be RESPECTFUL of others and wear your mask without question. I have been amazed at how well everyone has followed this while traveling. I will make a separate post regarding masks soon. 😷 Do not be afraid to travel. Be cautious. Be informed. Be prepared. Be smart. I do not fear the virus, but I greatly respect it, as should you. 💖 \n#travel #pandemictravel #flights #besmart #preparedness #respect #diningout #california #nevada #texas @koirestaurants (LA) @happyjewelers (ring) @kendrascott (earrings, necklace) @nordstrom (dress) #travelstyle #igtravel #safetyfirst #wearamask #socialdistancing","NumberOfLikes":26,"Hashtags":["#travel","#pandemictravel","#flights","#besmart","#preparedness","#respect","#diningout","#california","#nevada","#texas","#travelstyle","#igtravel","#safetyfirst","#wearamask","#socialdistancing"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Amanda Marek on August 28, 2020.

He said he ran extra fast back home to give it to me so that he didn\u2019t lose his place as the pack leader. I hope they realize this is what home school gym will be like in the 2020-2021 school year.\n\nTruthfully most days I feel like I am doing a subpar job at this stay at home, work at home, Covid lockdown mom gig. The house isn\u2019t spotless, the laundry isn\u2019t put away, I\u2019m the world most impatient teacher, the lawn isn\u2019t mowed, the bathrooms should probably be cleaned, their hair absolutely needs to be cut - and on and on we go. The truth is, they appreciate me more now that I\u2019m home. Covid stole my career (temporarily?) but reminded me what my real job is. And if you ever wondered if losing your shit at home was a real job, I\u2019m here to tell you it is. The pay is awful though. Zero stars, don\u2019t recommend. \n\nHowever today I made them Nutella on my homemade bread that I buttered and grilled outside because we had no power and they looked at me like I was the most brilliant superhero on Earth. I didn\u2019t correct them. I f\u2019ing am. \n\nSo I\u2019ll take this damn weed and treasure it like the worlds most eligible Batchelor gave it to me, because he did. \n\n#momlife #summertime #kids #boymom #dandilion #realtalk #covidlife #socialdistancing #mom","NumberOfLikes":33,"Hashtags":["#momlife","#summertime","#kids","#boymom","#dandilion","#realtalk","#covidlife","#socialdistancing","#mom"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by megan .  barkevich in New York.

Please hear me out. \n\nWe as parents should be teaching our children social distancing, wearing a mask, washing our hands, wearing gloves and sanitizing our hands. We had 5 months to prepare them for this. \n\nSo why are we the parents depending on schools to do it for us? \n\nWe need to implement this in our kids so that the school and teachers can carry this out. \n\nThese days teachers already have a handful on their plate. They need to implement what we have prepared our kids for. \n\nSo please I say this becuase we have to own up. Set that example to your child to wear their mask. If they haven\u2019t this is a perfect time for them to prepare. Take them on short outings so they know how much responsibility goes into this. \n\nIt\u2019s up to us to help save our lives as well as others. \n\nIf anyone took this the wrong way, it\u2019s not my intention but a wake up call is needed for all of us.\n\nHalal Life with Maria©️\nMaria Ali-Khan©️\n\n#halallifewithmaria #covid19 #socialdistancing #socialdistancing2020 #washyourhands #sanitize #wearyourmask #protectivegear #savelives #frontlineworkers #frontlineheroes #teachers #besafe #practicesocialdistancing #protectyourself #to #protectothers #mommyblogger #momof5kids #autismmom #schoolsafety #responsibility #instagram #instadaily #atopic #weare #scared #ofbut #haveto #followthrough","NumberOfLikes":8,"Hashtags":["#halallifewithmaria","#covid19","#socialdistancing","#socialdistancing2020","#washyourhands","#sanitize","#wearyourmask","#protectivegear","#savelives","#frontlineworkers","#frontlineheroes","#teachers","#besafe","#practicesocialdistancing","#protectyourself","#to","#protectothers","#mommyblogger","#momof5kids","#autismmom","#schoolsafety","#responsibility","#instagram","#instadaily","#atopic","#weare","#scared","#ofbut","#haveto","#followthrough"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Halal Life With Maria in Markham, Ontario.

Juston and I kept awkwardly trying to break it up and move away from this little girl\u2019s family...cause Rona. But Justice would not go any further without Jojo and Jojo wouldn\u2019t go without her either. They were inseparable within minutes.  I finally just looked at her parents and said, \u201CHey, um, so I think we\u2019re in this together.\u201D And they said, \u201CYeah...well, we\u2019re ok with that.\u201D We proceeded to get to know each other\u2019s families and experience the exhibits together. It was a wonderful afternoon. \n\nIn light of everything that\u2019s going on right now, I just wanna say WE\u2019RE IN THIS TOGETHER. And y\u2019all,  just like we had to figure things out for Jojo and Justice, we have to figure this out for all of our kids...So let\u2019s be better. Let\u2019s do justice. Let\u2019s act with empathy and understanding. Let\u2019s be responsible adults. Let\u2019s love.

The color of their hide is not the way to differentiate these species, instead look at their mouths. Black, or beaked, rhinos have lips the come to a beaked point, perfect for munching on bushes and low tree limbs. White, or wide-mouthed, rhinos have these broad, flat lips, used for grazing on the ground.

So I'm also continuing to weave the background of (photo 5) \"Cerberus,\" and I started the crochet on (photos 6-8) my tree, name TBD. \"Cerberus\" is due in a month 😬 and the tree is due at the end of November, so I have been and will be a busy, busy bee.

In the hellscape, I'm using yarn from Row House and @darngoodyarn, plus stash yarn. And in the final piece, my yarn is almost all from Row House, but I did also dip into my stash a little.\n.\nThe socially distanced open house for my @fwgallery show is Saturday, September 19th from 11-5. Masks are required. There will be refreshments (outside only), served by a server. If you just don't feel comfortable coming to an open house, the show will be online, or you can also view in person during regular open hours starting sometime in the 2nd week of September. I'll let you know the exact date in a later post. My show will contain 9 fiber (or primarily fiber) pieces, and 4 large ceramic bowls. \n.\n#wip #animalart #tardigrade #disco #waterbear #socialdistancing #quarantineart #mythologicalart #cerberus #yarnart #fiberart #textileart #rowhouseyarn #humansthatyarn #tapestryweaving #handmade #weaving #handwoven #handstitched #embroideryart #freeformcrochet #stitchersofinstagram #stitchersgonnastitch #makersgonnamake #modernmaker #modernembroiderymovement #contemporaryembroidery #nicegirlsneedleclub #batonrougeartist\n.\nP.S.

of Germany to cope with planned protests over the weekend by people opposed to the country\u2019s #coronavirusrestrictions.\n\nAuthorities in the German capital had banned the protests earlier this week, citing demonstrations a few weeks ago during which participants flouted rules on social distancing and mask-wearing.\n\nGermany has seen a rise in the number of virus #infections in recent weeks and officials had expressed concern that protesters might contribute to the spread of #coronavirus during their rallies and while traveling to and from Berlin. \n\nGermany has been widely praised for its handling of the pandemic through robust testing and #contacttracing and has seen far less drastic pandemic-related restrictions than other #European countries such as #France , #Italy or #Spain . Its confirmed virus-related death toll of 9,291 is one-fourth of Britain\u2019s toll, although experts say all numbers understate the true impact of the #pandemic due to various factors.\n\n#Protest organizers had appealed the ban and a regional administrative court ruled Friday that the #rallies could go ahead, saying there was no immediate threat to #publicsafety. The court ordered organizers to ensure social distancing. It didn\u2019t impose a requirement for participants to wear #masks, which aren\u2019t mandatory outdoors in #Germany but encouraged when #socialdistancing can\u2019t be maintained.\n\nAngered by the looming #ban, several groups had threatened to travel to #Berlin regardless. The presence of far-right groups among the #protesters had further raised #police concerns about the possibility of #unrest.\n\n#German Chancellor #AngelaMerkel said Friday, ahead of the #court ruling, that the right to appeal bans was part of the #freedomofassembly.\n\nAsked whether she would meet with protesters, as she has done in the past with #climateactivists and others, Merkel said: \u201CI always decide when people approach me whether I will seek to have talks with them.\u201D\n\nSo far, she was unaware of any such request, #Merkel added.","NumberOfLikes":7,"Hashtags":["#Berlin","#coronavirusrestrictions.","#infections","#coronavirus","#contacttracing","#European","#France","#Italy","#Spain","#pandemic","#Protest","#rallies","#publicsafety.","#masks,","#Germany","#socialdistancing","#ban,","#Berlin","#protesters","#police","#unrest.","#German","#AngelaMerkel","#court","#freedomofassembly.","#climateactivists","#Merkel"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Mizibak 🇬🇧 shadow banned again on August 28, 2020.

Dan dimakruhkan buat main-main dengannya dan terbangkannya dan berlumba.\u201D (Kitab Asnal Matalib)\n\nAda pun jika ada perjudian dalam perlumbaan seperti terbang paling cepat atau perjudian dalam pertandingan seperti burung paling cantik maka hukumnya haram tanpa khilaf.\n\nBerkata Imam Ibnu Quddamah :\n\nوَالْمُسَابَقَةُ عَلَى ضَرْبَيْنِ ؛ مُسَابَقَةٌ بِغَيْرِ عِوَضٍ ، وَمُسَابَقَةٌ بِعِوَضٍ . فَأَمَّا الْمُسَابَقَةُ بِغَيْرِ عِوَضٍ ، فَتَجُوزُ مُطْلَقًا مِنْ غَيْرِ تَقْيِيدٍ بِشَيْءٍ مُعَييَّنٍ\n\nArtinya : \u201CDan perlumbaan itu ada dua bahagi. Pertama ialah perlumbaan tanpa bertaruh dan keduanya perlumbaan dengan bertaruh. Maka adapun perlumbaan tanpa bertaruh maka harus  hukumnya dengan mutlak tanpa ada sebarang kaitan dengan suatu yang tertentu.\u201D (Kitab Al-Mughni)\n\nWalhasilnya jawapan bagi hukum berlumba kuda sebagaimana datang dalam soalan adalah harus tidak haram selagi tidak ada berlaku perjudian.\n\nMaksud pertaruhan yang diharamkan itu ialah pertaruhan yang menepati syarat perjudian.\n\nwallahua\u2019lam \nSumber dari FB ustaz azhar idrus @uaioriginal\n\n#vanjenazah #majlisilmu #malaysiagazette #hidayahitumilikallah #spjm #ukvj #vjpt #sm4a #mufidmakrifat #vjsa #kitabaikramaisayang #IndahDihati #bravoprojek #stayhome #socialdistancing #skuadpengurusanjenazahmalaysia #StaySafe #islamituindah #kitajagakita #jalanterus #mrdean #kitabelummenang #cakapdepandepan","NumberOfLikes":25,"Hashtags":["#vanjenazah","#majlisilmu","#malaysiagazette","#hidayahitumilikallah","#spjm","#ukvj","#vjpt","#sm4a","#mufidmakrifat","#vjsa","#kitabaikramaisayang","#IndahDihati","#bravoprojek","#stayhome","#socialdistancing","#skuadpengurusanjenazahmalaysia","#StaySafe","#islamituindah","#kitajagakita","#jalanterus","#mrdean","#kitabelummenang","#cakapdepandepan"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by SKUAD PENGURUSAN JENAZAH(SPJM) on August 28, 2020.
