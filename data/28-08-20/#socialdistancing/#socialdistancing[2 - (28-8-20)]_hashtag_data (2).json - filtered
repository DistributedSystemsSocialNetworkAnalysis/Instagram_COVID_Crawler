Your body, as a reaction, naturally sinks into relaxation. \n.\n.\nIt\u2019s a physical thing. 🙂\n.\n.\nI remember how during a body sense session with a woman with giant sleeping issues I proposed her to do this \u2018pillow-technique\u2019 during her session.

Our new ADC external suction unit  is designed to effectively remove these aerosols, filtering 99.997% of particles as small as 0.3 microns.\nThis is through a  high speed suction system.

Today's class focus is on lower body opening (with a special focus on tight hamstrings).\n\nI have an entire (growing) library of full-length yoga classes as well as many other workouts and exercise tutorials in the group (link to join in my bio).\n\nI sure do miss the days when I could teach a class in person without having to turn anyone away because we reached limited capacity (like this flashback of one of my classes).\n\nOur class motto in my yoga classes has always been \"we'll make room for you\". That every extra individual spirit in class adds more positive energy to the group.\n\nIf you attended weekly fitness class pre-2020, you'll know there's sometimes a territorial nature to \"your favorite spot\" in a class. Or even a degree of glancing over your shoulder at a latecomer & the temptation to feel smug like \"well, guess you should have gotten here early like the rest of us if you wanted a spot\".\n\nBut the truth is, you never know what may have held someone back from arriving at the same place & time as you. Maybe that person who always arrives late & leaves early is making the best of the precious little time they have available that day to sneak in a little self care. Maybe the person who seems rushed is the one who needs a moment of peace the most that day.\n\nI loved watching the grace, kindness & open hearts of students see someone come into a full class late (looking uncertain if there was going to be a place for them), scoot their mats over & gesture to the person to say \"hey, there's room for you by me\".\n\nLife socially distanced may look a little different for now. But there's always an opportunity somewhere in our day to extend fellow spirits some grace & understanding. I hope we all continue to find ways to be that light in the world that looks for ways to show \"hey, if there's not a space for you, I'll help make you one by me\".","NumberOfLikes":734,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Reese Woods Fitness in Columbia, South Carolina with @womenshealthmag, @healthmagazine, @womensbest, @ymca, @yoga, @buzzfeedhealth, and @ymcaofcolumbia.

Yet with so many people feeling self-conscious about wearing a mask it makes us avoid eye contact. We are even more reliant on eye contact at the moment because no one can see our smile or all the subtle gestures on the rest of our face whilst covered by a mask\n.\nHere are a few tips that will help you better communicate what you want to say but also show someone that you\u2019re listening whilst wearing a mask\n.\n1) Consciously make eye contact if you find you are averting people\u2019s gaze when wearing a mask\n.\n2) when you smile you, emphasise smiling with your eyes which may feel forced at first but it will be effective\n.\n3) Speak louder and enunciate your words as the mask muffles speech\n. \n4) Tilt your head or lean in a little more than usual to indicate you are paying attention\n.\n5) Use you hands more to express what you are saying \n.\nHope these help and please share so we can all make the most of the new normal.\n.\n#covid19 #covid_19 #socialdistancing #personalconnection #facemask #mask #mentalhealth #drchetnakang #wellbeing #relationships","NumberOfLikes":30,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#covid_19","#socialdistancing","#personalconnection","#facemask","#mask","#mentalhealth","#drchetnakang","#wellbeing","#relationships"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Dr Chetna Kang MB BS MRCPsych on August 28, 2020 tagging @radhidevlukia, @jagannatha_dasa, @spiritual_gains, and @nightingalehospital.
