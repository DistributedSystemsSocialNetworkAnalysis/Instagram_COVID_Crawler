During the pandemic in India ,two-thirds of firm-level apprenticeships and three-quarters of internships were absolutely disrupted.\n\nYouth in Asia and the Pacific were facing difficulties on the labor market well before the COVID-19 crisis, resulting in high unemployment rates and significant shares of youth excluded from both school and work. It is also being predicted that Youth (15-24 years) will be hit harder than adults (25 and older) in the immediate crisis and risk bearing higher longer-term economic and social costs. Young people face greater disruption to the labor market and work losses compared to adults, with almost half (more than 10 crore) working in the four sectors most seriously affected by the crisis. The sectors include wholesale and retail trade and repair; manufacturing; residential and industrial services; and accommodation and food services\n\nIts high time Governments should consider integrating youth participation in the broader labor market and initiatives for economic recovery, with youth-oriented strategies aimed at optimising resource performance. A failure to act to protect vulnerable youth populations, in particular, could be politically and socially calamitous.","NumberOfLikes":16,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Eat My News on August 29, 2020.

Well,🙊 add many more local trips and treks to the list. Last few years, I have either travelled most weekends and long holidays or sat diligently in front of laptop looking for deals and planning my next destinations. \n\nI enjoy travel wholly. Even the not so great parts of it. Travel is not just about seeing beautiful places and meeting interesting people. It's also long flight hours and slow internet connections.It's wearing same clothes the day after and sleeping in uncomfortable dorms and using crappy bathrooms.If you're a woman, travel is also being scared at times. \n\nMy last international trip lasted for a month and I had grand plans of repeating it again this year but alas everything went topsy-turvy! But what surprises me is that I haven't missed travel during this pandemic(at least so far!). I feel tad bit guilty when I see how everyone misses travel.\n\nAfter much pondering and wondering,my arm chair theory😅 tells me last couple of years has been all about travel and managing work that I have hardly had time to pursue other interests. I haven't been reading, writing or exploring art as much as I would like in the past. I also feel pandemic has given a chance to take things slow. So here I'm enjoying being a homebody and indulging in long forgotten hobbies which I'm sure wouldn't have happened otherwise. So tell me, how has your pandemic journey been so far?

This is not a gyan post, just realization and acceptance of my privilege. Gram Sewa Mandal in Wardha has over 200 workers (spinners, weavers and Khadi activists) who were gravely affected during the lockdown. Shops were shut down and with no sales, their income was at stake. My cousin sister who lives in Wardha started #ShopWithMe, a video call based shopping service to enable online sales of products made by Gram Sewa Mandal. I bought this beautiful pure Khadi saree through her initiative. \nDraping this soft, light yet firm 6 yards beauty weighed me down with responsibility. Responsibility of being aware of our privilege, to do our bit wherever possible and to ALWAYS always keep in mind that someone is worse-off than us. \nThe link in my bio will redirect you to GSM Facebook page. You can just scroll down to have a look at the range of products (including masks and men's shirts, jackets etc.) and order for a doorstep delivery. You never know who's life may depend on a 6 yard piece of cloth. \n\nPS: Khadi is the queen of fabrics. Period. No other material even makes it to a close second. \n\n#grateful #khadi #khadilove #lifestyle #sareestories #sareelove #indian #dressup #loveforsaree","NumberOfLikes":161,"Hashtags":["#lockdowndiaries","#quarantinedays","#ShopWithMe,","#grateful","#khadi","#khadilove","#lifestyle","#sareestories","#sareelove","#indian","#dressup","#loveforsaree"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1598589324,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 28 06:35:24 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#FinisherFriday - Motivation is compelling, and right now we all could use much more of that. Our Friday series aims to motivate fellow runners and fitness enthusiasts by spreading stories of people who continue to stay motivated through the lockdown.\n\nHere is how Rupali Shedge ( @rupalishedge ) makes fitness a priority regardless of the lockdown.\n\n\"When my friends used to ask me how do you get time for fitness with a busy work schedule. The answer was simple \" It's on my priority list and I have no choice\"\n\nGiving myself no choice has kept me going even in this lockdown. In fact, with more time in hand, I focused on my weaknesses and learned some new skills.\n\nWorking out at home definitely needs some focus and here's how I keep myself motivated\n◆ I plan my week which is a combination of cardio, strength, yoga and meditation.\n◆ The previous night I keep my gears ready so I am mentally prepared to get up for the workout (I sleep on time early since I workout in the mornings) getting enough sleep is very important.\n◆ I gear up properly for the workout as if there is going to be an audience 😃..that's how I put 💯\n◆ I take videos of my workout not only to share on social media😀 but also to check if I am doing the right form as there is no  trainer for supervision\n◆ I keep adding variations to my workout so it's not boring (thanks to my PT who has made my fundamentals clear)\n◆ I workout at the same time in the day that way your body clock is automatically set to the routine, just like eating and sleeping\n◆ I keep my diet in check that way fitness is on my mind throughout the day \n◆ I challenge myself with a new task and work towards achieving it.  keep my goals small and achievable.\" - @rupalishedge \n.\nHave a similar story that you want to share?

The thought of losing the training contract devastated me.\n\nIt had taken me 7 years to obtain a training contract so I could qualify and carry out my dream of working as a solicitor. \n\nDespite this I decided that I was actually still doing bloody great because I had these 2 👧🏻👧🏻 and family is everything to me 🌍. \n\nFast forward and we\u2019re now at the end of lockdown and as a family we\u2019re  moving to sunny ☀️Wales 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 and guess what...

But then, in 1348, arriving in Italy from the Orient by way of the Silk Road, the pandemic happened, exacerbating the political and economic tensions, breaking down social hierarchies, and ultimately killing 25 million people.\n\nBut such a tragic end to what we refer to as the Dark Ages was also the beginning of the Renaissance, a period in which blossomed the arts, the sciences, as well as the idea of equality and prosperity for all.\n\nFast forward to the 21st century, our time, and we've had, over the past two decades at least, something similar to the handgun and its more sophisticated derivatives -- technology at our fingertips. It has since triggered seismic changes, shaking up the system, breaking down barriers, moving power from the establishment to the individual, exposing the chinks in the armor of the once all mighty.\n\nAnd then came Covid-19.\n\nBut as in the Middle Ages, there is a light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nBe not afraid.\n\nMethinks that, just like the Renaissance, just like its many inventions -- the printing press, the telescope, the clock, the microscope, astronomy, even alchemy -- it won't just be a rebirth, it will be the dawn of a life we have never known before.\n\n#hopespringseternal\n#historyrepeatsitself \n#dejavu\n#strangehistory \n#quarantinejournal\n#lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":39,"Hashtags":["#hopespringseternal","#historyrepeatsitself","#dejavu","#strangehistory","#quarantinejournal","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by AA Patawaran in Intramuros, Manila.

Although, we were aware that there will be a comma which is going to arrive in our lives but we didn't expect it to be such a long pause. You did become an unnecessary pause of our beautiful song called \"life\"\n At the beginning, it didn't seem to be this major issue instead we were hoping to enjoy those few days of leisure and get an escape from all the hustle. But life doesn't move as you want it to, so all the plans and enjoyment were doomed by your presence. We couldn't be able to do what we wanted, we wanted to live but you forced us to turn on the survival mode, more than a master of our own self we became a slave of your existence.\n The pressure was building on each one of us to try and get back to the normal but you made us realise that there won't be any normal, atleast for now or maybe ever. Now your presence has began to haunt people, some couldn't get bread while others are still on the survival mode. \n  There has been a lot of hatred for you, but just looking at that moonlight amidst those dark clouds helped me understand that maybe just for a mere instance some of your perks are somewhat a blessing in disguise. I know everything went from bright to dull in these past few months but you made us realise that there is something which is more important than those rush of life and that is our family and friends. You made us perceive the fact that there presence is of the utmost importance in our life, you enlarged everything in life for us and made us believe that all those things we were directly or indirectly taking for granted is an absolute luxury for us and we can't thank you enough for that. By pushing us at the end of the darkness you made us look at the brighter side of few things\nContinued in comments....","NumberOfLikes":16,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The Perennial in India.

And the first few days passed without much worry. When it started appearing that the fight against the virus is long-drawn, I have started to become a bit more uneasy. The situation has rendered us helpless in ways that we cannot imagine. I saw a lot of my friends picking up new hobbies & producing content in & around the idea of a lockdown. I have instead chosen to do the most mundane, household tasks like helping my mother in her chores & work. That takes a considerable amount of my daily time. The rest, I spent in actively getting back to reading fiction. I aim to finish a novel per week. Some days, I have managed to finish two. This is in addition to what I am expected to read for my research work. \n\nAs far as my creative pursuits are concerned, I often get asked if I am using the lockdown period to write a new play. The answer has been negative so far. With so much going around, I don\u2019t know if one can afford cognitive isolation that is required to produce new work. Instead, I have been re-writing my last play in Hindi for a possible production next year. I am also finishing off pending administrative tasks for our theatre company. We were scheduled to commemorate the 70th anniversary of our theatre company in May 2020 with an array of events but all of it had to be called off. So we are also brainstorming to commemorate this moment virtually. All this, while being acutely aware that I have a roof over my head and the ability to feed myself.\n\nKaustubh Naik is a recipient of the Tendulkar-Dubey fellowship & his play, Avyahat, was recently staged at the International Theatre Festival of Kerala. An incoming doctoral student at the University of Pennsylvania, he has previously studied at Ambedkar University and JNU. He shares few images of his production, Avyahat (2018).

While we are infinitely grateful to be sheltered in the most amazing country, we also felt like we were indefinitely putting our lives on hold. There are things we should attend to back at home. \n\nOur return date coincided with the discovery of new community transmission in Auckland. It was a rude awakening that the pandemic is long from over. New lockdown in Auckland made our exit even more anxiety inducing. I was constantly in communication with our Airbnb host to ensure we can still stay there before our flight. Of course, I also worried about our flight being canceled the last minute. Worst of all I had to scratch my original plan of restaurant hopping in the city due to everything being closed in level 3 restriction.\n\nWe spent our last day of freedom getting haircuts for everyone. I have no idea when we will be able to do this again without wearing masks and being worried about getting or giving the virus.

As we move from summer to autumn, I ponder if there is much difference in this seasons living in Scotland \u2013 the weather can be debatable at times, but the plants and trees tell me yes there is a transition.\n\nIt has been a privilege to have the time, on my daily constitutional walk (at the start only 1-hour mind), to take in the beauty of the local countryside while in lockdown, never did I think in March that it would be August before things started to get back to the new \u2018normal\u2019.\n\nThose first months with the sun shining, listening to podcasts while walking and taking photos of the trees and plants as they emerged from their winter sleep, new shoots and buds followed by their vibrant colours as they sprang open in response to the heat and glorious sunshine we enjoyed, as I walked I took in the beauty of it all. It brought new dimensions to my homeopathic practice as I identified plants and matched them to remedy profiles.\n\nWhat will I miss about lockdown? The time it gave me not to be rushed or having to rush around, the time to potter in the garden, the free and paid online training (nice not to have to travel, clocking over 100 hours of training and updating knowledge), conversations with the neighbours, the peace from no traffic or planes going overhead, my daily walks\/cycles, watching the sunsets.\n\nWhat am I enjoying after lockdown? Having returned to face to face work at the end of July, the joy of seeing previous clients and welcoming new clients and making them feel better, structure to the day, increased motivation, getting to go out a bit more with friends and family and less queues for the shops!\n\nAnd did I finish the book?

It is the kind of food that you can rustle together using pantry staple spices, caramelized onions, ginger and garlic paste and ready on your table in less than 40 minutes. You could propel the curry with the welcome addition of most vegetables, most commonly exploited are, gravy-soaking potatoes or tender green peas. \n.\nThere are very willing ways to serve this curry, fluffy cumin basmati rice, soft rotis or scrumptious garlic naan breads to scoop up the spicy gravy. The spiced curry is mellow and relaxed, it\u2019s imbued flavours rooted in culture, deepening over time. \n.\nPerfect when shared with good company, forget the cutlery and go fingers in. \n.\nThis recipe is from my paperback cookbook - Cooking Memorable Food with Paz, to shop, tap the link in bio\n.\nFollow @foodiesof_cakewalk for more photos and ideas\/recipes.

That nespresso pod happens to be my favourite colour, I think!\nTo me, Tire lizié is the action of going to an elder matriarch (my mom or grand mother) and ask them to pass salt around my head 7 times. It is an extremely personal moment between my grandma and myself. I tend to do it when I\u2019ve had chronic headaches, anxiety attacks or just a feeling of malaise! To be very honest, I\u2019m sure that it isn\u2019t very Islamic, it is rather more cultural. Nazar 🧿 or evil eye is an Islamic concept though, we acknowledge the evil from envy, jealousy or ill wishing. In islam you would rather protect yourself through prayers than other acts. \nThe Nazar isn\u2019t limited to Islamic cultures or countries, it is a greatly respected within Turkey, Greece, Cyprus and many other middle eastern countries.\nThe important discussion though, isn\u2019t if you believe in it or not. Rather, it is about whether you are open to people who have other beliefs than you. Can you make this world a safe space for them and their practices.

This year due to Pandemic the Ganesh Chaturthi celebration remains a bit low in profile. \nAs a kid I always use to celebrate this festival with so much enthusiasm. \n.\n.\nThis year's festival is special to me because for the very first time I made Bappa's favourite Ukadiche Modak. They weren't as perfect as it's done by using a mould but I enjoyed while making. I made these with shradha in my mind for Bappa. I don't think the shape and size matters infront of the shraddha which makes prasad heaven. \n.\n.\nWe know that Ganpati Bappa is like a friend so he will accept my modaks...\n(Oh my friend Ganesha tu rehena sath humesha)\n.\n.\nI really want to visit Maharashtra at time of Ganesh Utsav to see the happiness that joy in people.\n.\n.\nIn Odisha we celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi a bit different. Like we offer God Boondi Laddoo and  Chudaghasa ( means Chivda powdered with sugar and bit of cardamom) prasad mixed with boondi , sev and fruits. It's different from Modak.\nBut this time I offered Bappa his favourite Modak which made me happy from inside.\n.\n.\nAnd yes this is my contribution to #ganeshchaturthiincovid.
