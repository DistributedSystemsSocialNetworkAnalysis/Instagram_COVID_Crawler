I also tidy up my entire plastic model collection. I now have a sizable PlaMo wall. I now have a total of 130 kits counting the add ons(65 Bandai and Kotobukiya kits, 65 Bootleg kits). As much as I want to use this as my background for my online classes, my parents thought it wouldn't send a good message to anyone who'd see. So I had to clean them up and set up an angle of my room where they would see my small bookshelf instead of my boxes. I strongly believe this would show that I'm doing my own art that is different from my writing. I believe that PlaMo building in itself is a form of art and performance. I know I'm not doing any recolors or drastic color change on my kits but I'm getting there. I'd just have to invest on a small compressor and airbrush set and I'll be ready. I've been planning to do so but some things don't always go your way. Still, this clean up allowed me to look into my hobby not just as a hobby but a lifestyle; something that you have to invest time and resources in order to be good at. Salute to my fellow builders out there! \nFor now, allow me to put these boxes back.\n.\n.\n.\n#abuilderslife\n#plamobuilder \n#plasticmodels \n#gunpla \n#gunplabuilder \n#gunplaislyf \n#gundamsofinstagram\n#bandai\n#kotobukiya\n#zoids\n#zoidsofinstagram\n#happykid\n#lockdown \n#lockdowndiaries \n#stayhome \n#stayhealthy","NumberOfLikes":14,"Hashtags":["#abuilderslife","#plamobuilder","#plasticmodels","#gunpla","#gunplabuilder","#gunplaislyf","#gundamsofinstagram","#bandai","#kotobukiya","#zoids","#zoidsofinstagram","#happykid","#lockdown","#lockdowndiaries","#stayhome","#stayhealthy"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Simon Pablo Reyes Felismino in Marikina City.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598101695,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 15:08:15 CEST 2020","Location":"Marikina City"},{"CaptionText":"We couldn't help but reposting this gorgeous corner set up by @mannuamrit.

If you have to pick from the many gems of Sicily, make sure Cefalù is one of them. The town first finds mention in 360 BC. Yup, you\u2019ll basically be tripping over history at every corner. After gaping open mouthed at the Duomo, I suggest you and your gelato make their way to the coastline. Duck into the corridor from the sunny street, and that is a glimpse of what awaits.  Go easy, the beauty is staggering. Step onto the beach and you are on the sets of Cinema Paradiso. Yes, the film was shot here, as were so many others. Finish that gelato, take your shoes off and wade a little into the water. Look at the town standing like a proud, beautiful woman at the water\u2019s edge.

This couldn\u2019t have been fiction, for the rawness of characters, experiences, the wallops of sensibilities, dubious repentance, felt like a documented re-telling of a livid, lived episode. \n\nThis is a letter from a son to his mother, content of which is written with a hope to be read someday, understood someday, felt someday. His family is a survivor of the war in Vietnam, distorted fragments of which is seen in what follows their survival. For a story this short, the topics branched bears quite some weight.\n\nOcean Vuong explores language on both a micro and macro level. A sense of poetry flows down in the writing (not surprising considering Ocean Voung is widely popular for his poems!), streaming across subjects of sexuality, race, gender, masculinity, grief and language. \n\nPlease give this a read. This is simple beauty of words, fear and ache, memory and survival, existence. \n\nCurrent goodreads rating: 4.05, and a delightful 10 for me! 💕\n#onearthwerebrieflygorgeous #oceanvuong #asianwriters #vietnamwar #motherandsonbond #lockdowndiaries #americandream #warfiction #warfictionbooks #existentialism #existentialcrisis #queerpride #queerbooks #conscioussexuality #masculinity #goodreads #goodreadschallenge2020","NumberOfLikes":35,"Hashtags":["#onearthwerebrieflygorgeous","#oceanvuong","#asianwriters","#vietnamwar","#motherandsonbond","#lockdowndiaries","#americandream","#warfiction","#warfictionbooks","#existentialism","#existentialcrisis","#queerpride","#queerbooks","#conscioussexuality","#masculinity","#goodreads","#goodreadschallenge2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by \u2022 The Lavelle Library \u2022 on August 21, 2020 tagging @ocean_vuong.","NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1598033490,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 20:11:30 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"शिक्षकांविषयी आणखी पोस्ट वाचण्यासाठी नक्की फाॅलो करा @shikshak_premi \n.\n\n#teachers #lockdowndiaries #marathilines❤ #jokes #professor #sir #madam #school #god","NumberOfLikes":43,"Hashtags":["#teachers","#lockdowndiaries","#marathilines❤","#jokes","#professor","#sir","#madam","#school","#god"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by शिक्षक प्रेमी on August 21, 2020 tagging @pustakch, @s_h_a_d_e_s_o_f_l_o_v_e, @shikshak_premi, @insidemarathibooks, and @anolakhi_vat_.

This pandemic devastated many industries including the realm of fashion, but we say no to a curtain call. Many fashion designers, fashion entrepreneurs and everyone involved in this industry deviated from their usual jobs and devised other ways to make ends meet and sustain their livelihood. Despite a dire situation, benevolent hearts within the fashion circle lent a helping hand by organizing donation drives for the less privileged communities and created protective suits and facemasks for our frontliners. \nIn support to this industry, I will promote businesses, encourage consumers, patronize services and participate in advocacies of protecting and saving lives. Being essential will always be fashionable and I AM ESSENTIAL in protecting this industry. I CAN PROTECT one's sustenance, I am #ProFashion and #ProLife. Let us all be empowered to help and inspire so we can survive and thrive while we wait for better days to come. \n#SceneZoneMagazine #ICanProtect #ProLife #ProFashion \n\nThank you Arvin Cruz of Scene Zone Magazine\n\n#followers #20likes #covid19 #selfies #likesforlike #philippines #instalikes #instaselfie #mask #lockdown #pinoy #facemask #newnormal #igersphilippines #lockdownlife #pinoyigers #lockdowndiaries #pinoygram #pinoystyle #homephotoshoot #newnorm #selfie #followforfollowback","NumberOfLikes":21,"Hashtags":["#ICANPROTECT","#ProFashion","#ProLife.","#SceneZoneMagazine","#ICanProtect","#ProLife","#ProFashion","#followers","#20likes","#covid19","#selfies","#likesforlike","#philippines","#instalikes","#instaselfie","#mask","#lockdown","#pinoy","#facemask","#newnormal","#igersphilippines","#lockdownlife","#pinoyigers","#lockdowndiaries","#pinoygram","#pinoystyle","#homephotoshoot","#newnorm","#selfie","#followforfollowback"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598004468,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 12:07:48 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Missing your traditional clothes?
