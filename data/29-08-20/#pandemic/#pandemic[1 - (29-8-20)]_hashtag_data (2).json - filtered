One of the major contributing factors lies in the fact that Black Americans disproportionately live in states that have not expanded Medicaid.\n\u201CIf I told you on Jan. 1 that a new virus that we did not even know about would, in August, be the third leading cause of death for Black Americans our hair should have been set on fire and we would have an extensive public policy response to this unprecedented pandemic,\u201D Trevon Logan, professor of economics at the Ohio State University and co-author of the report said. Only heart disease and cancer top the virus.\nLogan said the range of devastation has largely gone unnoticed in part because most states have been under a quasi-quarantine since March.\nBradley Hardy, another author of the study, says over 50% of Black Americans live in a household where employment income has been lost since mid-March and 20% of families live with some form of food hardship.\nHe said Black families face not just pre-existing health conditions, but pre-existing economic disparities as well. Hardy said almost half of Black households are concerned with their ability to make rent on a monthly basis. The report lays out many ways the pandemic has exposed how Black Americans are being affected by the virus. The co-authors say policy solutions are required to solve the challenges both in the immediate and long term.

Each of their soaps have a tremendous healing benefit. Some of our favorites are the oatmeal & coconut for body care, the rosemary, honey & aloe vera for hair care and the tumeric soap for removing scars and evening the skin tone\n.\nMajadero offers many more soaps, such as a ginger and honey soap (great for anti-inflammation) and an avocado soap (great for moisture.) It is hard to choose but the turmeric soap may be our favorite soap!!!\n.\nMany soaps claim to be natural, but often are filled with chemicals that are unnecessary, and only added to extend the shelf life of the product. It is often difficult to find soaps with few ingredients (as they should be) that are actually natural and chemical free, but with these soaps that is not a problem. We are very grateful for this initiative! All bottles used for delivery of products are recycled to reduce waste 🌍 These are just some of the many beautiful things happening in Havana right now.

To misrecognize victimhood as \u201Cresilience\u201D is to ignore how disasters reflect and reinforce social inequalities.\n\nAt some point, we have to stop romanticizing resilience, and start demanding answers \u2014 why especially the poor and the marginalized, have to be \u201Cresilient\u201D in the first place?","NumberOfLikes":8,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Angeline on August 29, 2020.

Wichtig ist hierbei eigentlich nur die Fähigkeit zur Adaption. Wenn wir nicht in der Lage sind Veränderungen als Chance zu begreifen, stagnieren wir entweder und gehen im Kollateraleffekt unter oder man protestiert dagegen (bspw. in Berlin).\n\nIch für meinen Teil habe mich dazu entschieden, die aktuelle Situation als Chance zu nutzen. Verbunden mit allen zur Folge entstehenden Konsequenzen. Vielleicht fällt es mir auch einfacher diesen Weg zu beschreiten, weil ich gerade so ziemlich alles als Neuanfang begreife und ich schon zwei Mal mit dieser Radikalität erfolgreich war.\n\nFür mich geht es also weiter. An einem neuen Ort, mit einem neuen Leben, mit einer neuen Passion.\n\nDass ich in Zukunft nicht mehr so oft an dem einen oder anderen Ort zu sehen sein werde, hat nichts mit irgendwelchen persönlichen Bewandnissen oder Befangenheit zu tun. Es ist einfach das neue Extrem welches ausgelebt werden muss, um auch das volle Potential der neuen Situation zu erkennen und vor allen Dingen zu nutzen. Ich muss dies tun, um meinen neuen Platz in dieser pandemischen Dystopie zu finden.\n\nEs ist nichts persönliches.

At the same time, we are still holding our collective breath, just a little bit. We are a bit conflicted: relieved that new cases are coming down, but appalled by the number of deaths, especially among the elderly. We are not sure what we should be feeling: relief or horror.\r\n\r\nIn this Sunday\u2019s #Gospel, Peter is horrified by Jesus\u2019 prediction about how his life would end. He imagined that #Jesus would turn out to be a victorious King, not a criminal hanging on a cross.\r\n\r\nLast Sunday, Jesus proclaimed Peter \u2018blessed\u2019 because of his God-given insight into who Jesus was. Now Peter is \u2018Satan\u2019 because it is not God-given insight, but human thinking, he now shows. Jesus tells Peter that he is a stumbling block, getting in the way of God.\r\n\r\nThe followers of Jesus are called to become stepping stones, not stumbling blocks.\r\n\r\nHow do you become a #steppingstone? Jesus says it\u2019s by renouncing yourself, taking up you cross every day and following him. Doesn\u2019t sound too attractive, does it? Essentially, it means putting God and other people, instead of ourselves, at the centre of our hearts and our lives. It is about living a generous human life as Jesus has shown us and as God intended. That way we make a path for each other across the often turbulent waters of life.\r\n\r\nMy Grandmother used to say that most crosses in life come on two feet. How true. It is not just about the suffering others cause us. It is also about the fact that doing acts of kindness and love and putting other people\u2019s needs ahead of our own costs us. Following Jesus is a demanding business.\r\n\r\nIn facing this #pandemic we don\u2019t need stumbling blocks, we need stepping stones. We need to carry each other through what is happening to us.\r\n\r\nStepping stones are not all perfectly shaped and they are all different. But together they provide a path and a safe crossing for life\u2019s journey.\n\nDownload #CelebratingAtHome here:\nhttps:\/\/carmelites.org.au\/item\/826-stumbling-blocks-or-stepping-stones\n\n#prayer #reflection #meditation #scripture #faith #spirituality #carmelite #carmelites #hope","NumberOfLikes":16,"Hashtags":["#Victoria,","#Gospel,","#Jesus","#steppingstone?","#pandemic","#CelebratingAtHome","#prayer","#reflection","#meditation","#scripture","#faith","#spirituality","#carmelite","#carmelites","#hope"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Carmelites Australia & E Timor on August 29, 2020.

Here are some of the effects it has had, according to recent research.⠀\n⠀\nPeople are sleeping for longer⠀\nData from fitness devices has revealed that Brits, for instance, have been sleeping 15 minutes longer, whereas Germans have been sleeping a mere 8 minutes more. The French have taken full advantage of the situation, sleeping for just over 20 minutes more, and the Italians have been stealing an extra 17 minutes under the covers.⠀\n⠀\nPeople struggling to sleep⠀\nIn a survey by the Sleep Council, 43% of the 2 700+ respondents who took part in the body\u2019s research said they were finding it hard to sleep. The uncertainty the pandemic had created was the reason for three quarters of these people. The survey also found that women are suffering more than men from anxiety around the coronavirus.⠀\n⠀\nPeople experiencing strange dreams⠀\nAnxiety disrupts our sleep and causes us to wake up more and, as a result, we tend to remember the dreams because we\u2019ve woken up during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The anxiety also causes dreams to become more vivid. The dreams themselves may be the subconsciousness\u2019s way of trying to work out our emotional problems. Since people are sleeping longer, they may be experiencing more rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the stage from which we recall most dreams. ⠀\n⠀\nPeople\u2019s days are (seemingly) running into one⠀\nResearch by the smart mattress company Eight Sleep has found that US citizens are sleeping just 12 minutes longer on weekends than on weekdays. Before the pandemic, they were sleeping for 90 minutes longer.⠀\n⠀\nLate nights but early mornings⠀\nElectricity meter data from New York apartments shows its citizens have been staying up later \u2014 they\u2019re using a lot more energy and binge watching at night may be the reason. It may also be the reason why not as many people are setting their alarm clocks.⠀\n⠀\nRead the full article on zmescience.com⠀\n⠀\n#coronavirus #sleep #science #research #sciencenews #interesting #virus #pandemic","NumberOfLikes":6,"Hashtags":["#coronavirus","#sleep","#science","#research","#sciencenews","#interesting","#virus","#pandemic"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ZME Science on August 29, 2020.

Ik draaide 24 uur mee in een verpleeghuis waar Corona flink om zich heen had gegrepen. Er waren veel bewoners overleden en bijna alle medewerkers van de afdeling waar ik verbleef waren ziek geweest. Mijn moeder zei een paar dagen eerder nog: nou Room, hoeveel mensen kennen we eigenlijk die ziek zijn geweest? Ik kon toen bijna niemand opnoemen. Na vorige week is dat wel anders. Het viel niet mee op tijdens die 24 uur de 1,5 meter afstand te houden. Bewoners wilde mij aanraken, hand in hand door de gangen schuifelen. De verhalen die ik maandenlang via het nieuws had gevolgd, hoorde ik nu van dichtbij. Gruwelijk. Een ander woord heb ik er niet voor. Bovendien waren de gevolgen zichtbaar: lege bedden, beperkt bezoek en na 24 uur was ik emotioneel best wel gesloopt. De beelden heb ik vluchtige bekeken. Ze zijn mooi, intiem en realistisch. Maar is het beeldverhaal ook écht representatief voor deze locatie? Ik ga er niet aan ontkomen om tekst en uitleg te geven. De pandemie is nog niet voorbij lieve mensen. Hou je aan de 1,5 meter. Blijf thuis bij klachten en laat je testen. Dit jaar probeer ik nog 3 locaties te bezoeken. Ik hoop dat de deuren open blijven maar ik hou mijn hart vast.... de eerste afmelding is alweer binnen.

We need to reshape our ways of living to a more sustainable way. Control population, limit industries that pollute & shave forests, & be kind to one another.\nStop thinking of \u2018I\u2019, & start thinking of \u2018Us.\u2019\n__\nFor many, the great Pandemic of 2020 is a great disruption of our plans. But what is happening really?\n\nSCIENTIFICALLY. Fact: Viral outbreaks are a normal course of nature. It is nature\u2019s way to balance something that is detrimental to its health. It occurs in plants and animals to control population. We are of course just part of the fauna.\n\nSPIRITUALLY. Deep inside, the cosmos is fighting a spiritual revolution. This imbalance with the battle of good and evil has long been waging and has now come to a standstill.\n\nWe can observe this with the social unrests this year, the #BLM rallies, the inequality, poverty, negligence, the cataclysm, the excessant greed for more wealth, the molestation of the environment for economic gain, etc.\n\nWe need to relearn the principles we were taught as kids. To treat oneself & each other with compassion, respect & love. \n\nINDIVIDUALLY. Strive to be self aware. Aware of our health, consumption & our thoughts. Check our prejudices. Those innocent thoughts yet quite destructive. In this time in history, ask yourself to where do you stand? Moving forward, we need to adapt to a more diverse & ever growing population. How do we accomodate everyone? How can I help?\n\nENVIRONMENTALLY. This pandemic is telling us that we need to reduce our carbon footprint on Earth. Viral outbreaks will happen and will continue to happen as humans encroach the living space of animals. The more we overpopulate & deforest jungles, the more we are closer to fauna with viral defense mechanisms. \n___\nThe Black Plague in the Middle Ages brought great death & destruction. This was because of ignorance, more reliance on religious dogma & destructive habits among the people. \n\nEventually the plague ended when there was a shift in thought. Quarantines were implemented & people followed hygiene rules.

Sejumlah kanal media sosial menjadi harus memiliki izin, termasuk bila masyarakat selaku pemilik akun di kanal tersebut akan melakukan siaran langsung.\n\n.\n\"Akan memiliki implikasi sangat besar dan luas serta dapat menimbulkan ketidakpastian hukum, baik dalam industri penyiaran maupun dalam tatanan kehidupan masyarakat,\" kata Direktur Jenderal Penyelenggaraan Pos dan Informatika (PPI) Kominfo, Ahmad M Ramli.\n\n.\n\"Mengingat perluasan definisi penyiaran akan mengklasifikasikan kegiatan seperti Instagram TV, Instagram Live, Facebook Live, YouTube Live, dan penyaluran konten audio visual lainnya dalam platform media sosial akan diharuskan menjadi lembaga penyiaran yang wajib berizin.

Another sobering report indicated that beyond the 100,000 people who have already died from COVID-19 in\nthe U.S., as many as 75,000 more could die what\u2019s termed \u201Cdeaths of despair\u201D\u2014 from substance abuse or suicide \u2014as a result of the consequences of the pandemic, both social and economic. Those numbers are unthinkable.\nBut anyone, been in therapy or even just had an honest conversation with a trusted friend can tell you that one of the most vital resources available to us is connection: the simple, radical act of piercing the divide between the frightened, insular self and the people around us who might seek to understand. There\u2019s a difference between a grainy face on a screen and the embrace of a loved one. In order to be truly vulnerable, we need to be felt.\n\nFor me, the tools that I relied upon to feel well often looked less like treatment and more like the ingredients that make up a full, joyful life: the friends I saw for long, intimate dinners; the work events that made me feel purposeful and accomplished; even the affirming gym I went to in the mornings, which had as much body diversity as anyone.\n\nThis is the problem that confronts many of the people who are living through this epidemic alone: our only company right now may be our demons.\n\nPicture and text borrowed from:\nTime 22 - 29, June 2020\/ Stuck with yourself by Sam Lansky\n.\n\n#covid19 #coronavirus #virus #disease #loneliness #pandemic #pandemic2020 #pandemicoronavirus2020","NumberOfLikes":1,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#coronavirus","#virus","#disease","#loneliness","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#pandemicoronavirus2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Anjani Kumar Tripathi on August 28, 2020.

This happened after a homicide suspect took his own life on Nicollet Mall, according to Minneapolis police. Social media posts show images of people damaging items in a Target as well as broken windows of surrounding stores. Haskell's liquor store, Saks Off 5th, the Medical Arts building and Nordstrom were also looted earlier in the evening. The last night of the Republican National Convention saw hundreds of people around Black Lives Matter Plaza protesting racial inequality and police brutality. A group of angry protesters has confronted senator Rand Paul near the White House in Washington DC. As Rand walked through the crowd with his wife, demonstrators chanted 'say her name', in reference to Breonna Taylor, a black woman from Kentucky who was shot dead by police in May. After the incident, Paul tweeted to say that he had been 'attacked by an angry mob of over 100'.

Modern roman öncüsü olarak kabul edilen Austen, o dönemin romantizm etkilerinden sıyrılarak, kitaplarını gündelik hayattan ve 'sıradan insan hayatlarından esinlenerek sade dil kullanarak bugüne kadar birçok kitabı kaleme almıştır. \n\nİkna kitabı kaleme aldığı son kitap olmakla birlikte aslında Austen'in klasikleşmiş, dili ve her kitabın tekdüze olması ilgi çekicidir. Her zaman farklı karakter ve olay örgüsü ile karşımıza çıkıyor olsa da bir önceki kitaptaki karakter ile bir sonraki karakterler hep birbiri ile örtüşür.\n\n✏️Bu kitapta ana karakterimiz Anne Elliot'tur. Zengin ve varlıklı bir aileden gelen Anne, küçük yaşta annesini kaybetmiş, babası ve iki kız kardeşi ile hayatını idame etmiştir. Ortanca genç kadın olan Anne'in, Elizabeth ve Mary adlı iki kız kardeşi var. Elizabeth Elliot, en büyük Mary ise en küçük kardeşidir. Sir Walter Elliot, eşini kaybettikten sonra üç kızı ile birlikte Kellynch hall deki malikanesinde şık ve lüks yaşamlarına devam ederler. Mary Elliot erken yaşta evlenerek mutlu bir yuvaya sahip olur. Sade orta halli bir geliri olan Charles ile evlenir. Elizabeth, ailenin en büyük kızı olduğu için, evi idare etmekten kendini sorumlu tutmuştur. Babasıyla evin tüm idaresini eline almış, fakat harcamalarına dikkat etmedikleri için masraflarını azaltmak adına yaşadıkları malikaneyi kiraya vererek daha sade bir yaşam sürmek istemeleri Anne karakterinin geçmişte alevlendirdiği aşkına tekrar kavuşmasına sebep olur.\n\n✏️Tutkulu bir aşk, gurur ve sonunda pes ediş. Wentworth karakterini okurken disiplinli, tutkulu ve saygılı bir karakter olarak kafamda tahayyül etmeye çalıştım. Fakat kitapta bu karakter nedense bana pek samimi gelmedi...😊\n\n📽 Jane Austen İkna kitabı filmlere de uyarlanmıştır 👏\n\n#catsofinstagram #bookstore #books #bookphotography #booklover #bookstagram #bookstagramturkey #janeausten #ikna #love #romantic #vscocam #vscocat #library #stayhomestaysafe #pandemic #kitap #newpost #freedom #eternity #romance #persuasion #like4likes #likeforlikes #followmenow #2020 #analyze #summernights #instago #blogger","NumberOfLikes":24,"Hashtags":["#catsofinstagram","#bookstore","#books","#bookphotography","#booklover","#bookstagram","#bookstagramturkey","#janeausten","#ikna","#love","#romantic","#vscocam","#vscocat","#library","#stayhomestaysafe","#pandemic","#kitap","#newpost","#freedom","#eternity","#romance","#persuasion","#like4likes","#likeforlikes","#followmenow","#2020","#analyze","#summernights","#instago","#blogger"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by niliindunyasi on August 28, 2020 tagging @niilerg.
