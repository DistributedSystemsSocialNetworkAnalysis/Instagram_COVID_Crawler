As well as for fans alike. \n\nAmazon pushes forward with a green effort with purchasing 1800 electric vans. But they still have a long way to prove in major efforts of sustainability which include their packaging and employee safety.\n\nThe accelerated shopping season seen from the start of quarantine is starting to see a decline. Which is driving another prediction of shopping malls to see closing within the next 5 years. As they were predicted years ago as well, but this time may be more plausible now.\n\nLastly, get prepared early for this holiday shopping season. You may want to get your I.O.U. cards ready just in case.

Tired, but happy. I\u2019m out of clips, almost out of pins, and almost out of ear loops. Soon these will be on the faces of children who I will likely never meet, children who are heading back to school in Milwaukee, whose parents may not be able to afford masks. I wish I could do more. I wish I had time to do more. I wish I could give them to everyone who needs them. But this about 15 hours of work so far already (and they are only about 1\/4-1\/3 way finished), and the clock keeps reminding me that there are only 24 hours in the day. I wish I was independently wealthy and could just do this all day for everyone who needs them. I wish I could do more, but this is what I have to offer. And although 100+ masks seems so insignificant compared to the population of Milwaukee, I didn\u2019t want that to stop me from giving. My heart is full. Lots of sewing to get done around my working hours this weekend.

Owners Seth and Levi will be onsite to walk you through our space and to answer any questions you have about climbing, our community goals, memberships, or our overall vision for the future.⠀\u2060\n⠀\u2060\nBut this isn\u2019t just any old Open House! It\u2019s also an opportunity for you to join us in raising money and collecting canned goods for those in need of food. The ongoing Coronavirus pandemic continues to severely affect our communities, so we\u2019re partnering with the Atlanta Community Food Bank to help provide food for people struggling with hunger. We\u2019ll be accepting canned food donations during the Open House as well as throughout the month of September, so beginning on September 1st, feel free to come by anytime from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm, Monday \u2013 Friday until September 30th, to drop off your donation. And for those of you who\u2019d like to make a monetary contribution instead, you can donate directly to the Food Bank via our donation page (link in bio).⠀\u2060\n⠀\u2060\nAlthough we still don\u2019t know when we\u2019ll be able to open, we\u2019re excited for the chance to show you around and give you a taste of what to expect at The Overlook. So grab some canned goods and come on down to the West End on September 12th, we look forward to meeting you!

So for me, listening to a podcast is one of the ways to ensure I run on my easy pace.\n\nI chose this Ted Talk Interview with psychologist Susan David, Phd. on a topic I believe I still need to learn a lot of: Emotional Resilience. \n\n\"Life's beauty is inseparable from its fragility,\" says Susan. In this podcast, she shares wisdom on how to build resilience, courage and joy in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nSusan believes that there is no such thing as good and bad emotions. In fact, all type of emotions have helped us humans surviving the world since the beginning of time. If we push our emotions aside (and the most common ones are sadness or any emotions which make us uncomfortable), we lose our ability to respond effectively. \n\nInstead of simply \u201Cpushing through\u201D to positivity, we take these emotions as cue cards of what we need or are lacking from - and discover practical ways that we can be with ourselves and our emotions\n\n\u201CBetween stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.\u201D \nViktor E Frankl, Austrian neurologist and psychiatrist, and a Holocaust survivor\n\nCourage is not the absence of fear. \n\nCourage is being able to notice your fear and your disquiet and chose the RIGHT THING to do, in alignment with your values.\n\nKeep running 💙\n\n#run #runner #running #strava #stravarunning #garmin #garminrunning #garminau #beatyesterday #runningmumsaustralia #indorunners #indorunnersaustralia #ftuirunners #keeprunning #pandemic  #lockdown #stage4restrictions  #melbourne  #runningmotivation #runningblog #runningblogger #silverlining #emotionalresilience #resilience","NumberOfLikes":26,"Hashtags":["#2020kmin2020","#run","#runner","#running","#strava","#stravarunning","#garmin","#garminrunning","#garminau","#beatyesterday","#runningmumsaustralia","#indorunners","#indorunnersaustralia","#ftuirunners","#keeprunning","#pandemic","#lockdown","#stage4restrictions","#melbourne","#runningmotivation","#runningblog","#runningblogger","#silverlining","#emotionalresilience","#resilience"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598658454,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 29 01:47:34 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"shineyvegnyc","CaptionText":"Beyond sausages 🙌🙌🙌 #veganoptions \u2063\nAngel will hook you up ! @citybeernyc  Ask for their vegan options, they\u2019re  not on the menu yet.

Just for being you ♥️ We are in such crazy times right now and it\u2019s rare that our entire world is experiencing that same struggle together. I had a moment at the shops yesterday where I kinda stopped and thought, wow, I\u2019m starting to forget what the world looked like pre-Covid, and that was a weird feeling. I remember the day I walked into work and our boss said, \u201Cget all your stuff together it\u2019s time to relocate home indefinitely\u201D. It was a mix of yes how awesome, woah what\u2019s going on, and how long will this last? I remember being so nervous about how to go outside my house while keeping safe but now it\u2019s such second nature. The prospect of 3 months locked down in the beginning was hard to fathom, I thought they were exaggerating. But now we are nearing 6 months and there is no end in sight. This is a time we will never see again, and hopefully the next few generations don\u2019t either. But there are some incredible things that have come out of it. Kindness, empathy, togetherness, community spirit, compassion, support, and love! I look at our Jeep community here on insta, the community I physically live in here at home, and the ones I\u2019m part of at work and socially and I feel so blessed to witness the strengthened bonds we share. The world has banded together in a way that makes me proud of humanity and I think that\u2019s something really magical to cherish out of this pandemic.

My injured foot started hurting again. I believed #lockdown would help me #heal but when lockdown got extended and i didn't have any visibility of the #pandemic situation getting better and no travel plans for the year...that's where i started giving up on all aspects of life, including myself.\n\nI decided to take a step back and turn things around for myself. For what it was worth, I started by telling myself, \"I deserve to be #happy and I will stand up for myself, no matter what!\" After few days of introspection, I wanted to make some changes in my life. 1. Fight #insomnia. I knew it would take time but no matter what i will give it all. 2. I will not let #stress at work affect me. 3. I will #learn something #new #everyday\n\nFocussing on the last point, out of the many things i learnt, the most important one was caring for myself. I had already been working out regularly. I made a conscious effort to manage my work time so that i could log off on time. I learnt to manage stakeholder's expectation and tell myself it wouldn't hurt to complete something next day. When I was not well a couple of times, i unapologetically communicated to my team and took an hour's rest, something i wouldn't do couple of months before this. I have started believing if i needed help, i just had to ask for it. I learnt to accept my vulnerabilities. I have always been telling myself i'm too busy but I reconnected with old friends and relatives individually. I found #peace.\n\nSecondly, I learnt new skills - Not machine learning, but practical and simple stuffs that kept me engaged and happy. #Cooking #foodphotography, montages, sewing, growing herbs, plants propagation, home decor and so many other things! I even learnt how to style men's hair with amd without a trimmer. Thanks to YouTube and the man who trusted me with his hair! I probably would not have learnt any of this if there was no lockdown!\n\nIn short, we can never know how much time we've got so why not make each day count by learning new things and prioritising self!\n#aaaeee \n#alsolearning\n#learningbeyondboundaries\nThx @sayanki16","NumberOfLikes":24,"Hashtags":["#mentalhealth.","#lockdown","#heal","#pandemic","#happy","#insomnia.","#stress","#learn","#new","#everyday","#peace.","#Cooking","#foodphotography,","#aaaeee","#alsolearning","#learningbeyondboundaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1598646671,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 28 22:31:11 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"mccm.architecture","CaptionText":"When it comes to a post-Covid-19 way of life, only one thing matters: the safety and health of the public, within the collective well-being of communities; amidst the built environment. \n\nPlanning and designing with CDC , medical, and local, county, and state, health guidelines and regulations, is paramount.\n\n#covid19 #covidreadiness #covidprecautions #covidphotodiaries #coviddiaries #MyPandemicSurvivalPlan #designwithsafety #SocialDistancing #NewNormal #InThisTogether #SurvivingCovid #FlattenTheCurve #Preparedness #DisasterPreparedness #BePrepared #Survival #SafetyGuidelines #CovidPlanning #CDCGuidelines\n\n@WHO @CDCGOV","NumberOfLikes":19,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#covidreadiness","#covidprecautions","#covidphotodiaries","#coviddiaries","#MyPandemicSurvivalPlan","#designwithsafety","#SocialDistancing","#NewNormal","#InThisTogether","#SurvivingCovid","#FlattenTheCurve","#Preparedness","#DisasterPreparedness","#BePrepared","#Survival","#SafetyGuidelines","#CovidPlanning","#CDCGuidelines"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Master & Commander Architects on August 28, 2020.

Here\u2019s how to respond...\n\nPeople tried to push each other around before the #pandemic . But lately it seems as if the bullies are taking over. Constant fear and anxiety fuel anger. The move of many of our interactions online means we are having less face-to-face communication; psychologists have long known that this decreases empathy, which makes it easier to misbehave. And in a time of deep polarization, the tone of public discourse has grown more antagonistic.\n\n1.  Do not engage. \u201CThe only winning move is not to play the game,\u201D says Laurie Helgoe, a clinical psychologist.  Engaging will encourage the bully, who will respond to feeling threatened by attacking more, she says.\n\n2.  Don\u2019t let the bully take up space in your head. Try to limit how much you think or talk about the person to others. Block the bully on social media. \u201CYou\u2019re establishing a boundary.  You aren\u2019t going to let the bully take over your life.\u201D \n\n3.  Accept that you\u2019re not going to change the person.

Especially long-distance-trips are quite hard with the mask. But let\u2019s play a small intellectual game about how travelling could look like if there wouldn\u2019t be the pandemic or in the future.\nDuring I was studying in Glasgow, we\u2019ve had a very interesting module called \u201EConsumer Buying Behaviour\u201C. It was in general about perception, attitude and the consumer decision-making process. It was full of content, and the final group work was full of creativity. The task was to develop a product or a brand and to prepare a small marketing concept to apply the whole theory. My group and I decided to create a brand called CrossIsle. It is a hybrid train, which connects Thurso, the most northern train station of Great Britain with Penzance in the sunny region of Cornwall, in the South. There are two main routes. But those are enough information about the connection. Because the train itself is innovative, with three classes: the Economy class, where you have seats, the Business class which looks more or less similar to the Business class in an aeroplane. And there is a first-class, which you can see in the picture, where you have your room. So it was very funny to create a story around that train service and since my group was very international, we\u2019ve shared a lot of experiences about taking a train in different countries. So finally, we\u2019ve got quite a good mark for the project, for this train service, which connects the North and the South of Great Britain without change of train. So this was an amazing project as well as VeCork-Bags. You can find some information about this group work on my blog :).\n#travelling #trains #greatbritain #overnight #business #economy #firstclass #corona #pandemic #project #groupwork #thurso #penzance #highlands #cornwall #glasgow #glasgowcaledonianuniversity #gcu #erasmus #abroad #exchange #holidays #international #comfort #consumerbehaviour #buying #decisionmaking","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#travelling","#trains","#greatbritain","#overnight","#business","#economy","#firstclass","#corona","#pandemic","#project","#groupwork","#thurso","#penzance","#highlands","#cornwall","#glasgow","#glasgowcaledonianuniversity","#gcu","#erasmus","#abroad","#exchange","#holidays","#international","#comfort","#consumerbehaviour","#buying","#decisionmaking"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by felix.stdz on August 28, 2020.

I love Guanajuato because I decided 7 years ago, that I wasn't going to feel sorry for my myself anymore, that every decision I made from that day onwards was going to be to achieve my goals.\n\nAnd I'm glad as well that I was able to share this trip with someone that I really hold most dear.\n\nFor those who have been sharing and following my photograply work, thank you from the bottom of my heart.\n\nThank you for your time reading this, thank you for the appreciation you have of my work and thank you all for continue believing there is always something better out there.\n\nSee you on the other side of the lens. \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#guanajuato #roadtrip #alhondigadegranaditas #sunnyday #covid_19 #pandemic #viajes #mexico #7yearsago #2020 #amateurphotography #nofilter #galaxynote10plus #galaxynote10plusphotography #portraitphotography #lumia #microsoftlumia #lumia800 #travel #memories #peace #green #nopeople #ancientbuilding #ancientcity #bestfriends #bestdaysof2020 #bestyearever #bestyearofmylife #photography","NumberOfLikes":11,"Hashtags":["#guanajuato","#roadtrip","#alhondigadegranaditas","#sunnyday","#covid_19","#pandemic","#viajes","#mexico","#7yearsago","#2020","#amateurphotography","#nofilter","#galaxynote10plus","#galaxynote10plusphotography","#portraitphotography","#lumia","#microsoftlumia","#lumia800","#travel","#memories","#peace","#green","#nopeople","#ancientbuilding","#ancientcity","#bestfriends","#bestdaysof2020","#bestyearever","#bestyearofmylife","#photography"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Aldo Mejía Arellano in Alhóndiga de Granaditas.

I reached out to a few of my friends who admitted experiencing the same phenomena. \n\nWhen involved in a painful breakup we normally tell ourselves wenever want to see this person again. But in the age of social media it's difficult to fully escape; even if it's 10 years later.\n\nI guess if you and your ex partner had a reasonably amicable breakup, then it may be normal to recieve the odd check in text.\n\nBut what happens if you had a toxic relationship, and made it clear you are no longer interested?\n\nEven then it may be 'normal' for them to contact you every now and then, to see if they can still wrap you round their little finger (thank goodness for the BLOCK option). \n\nBut we are living in unusual times. Which is why ex's maybe be coming at you from all angles.\n\nFrom doing some research I have compiled some of the most common reasons your exs are coming out the woodwork:\n\n- They miss you\n- They want to make amends\n- They want to know if you're over them\n- They care about your wellbeing \n- They are feeling nostalgic \n- They are thinking about their own mortality \n- They are lonely\/bored\n- They want to apologise \n- They want you back\n\nMaybe the pandemic brings out their softer more compassion side, making them reconsider their morals and values or maybe they are just up to their old tricks (?)\n\nOnly you truly know. If you do decide to reconnect - keep your boundaries and stay safe.\n\n#ex #pandemic #covid19 #relationships101  #relationshipstuff #interracialrelationships #healthyrelationships  #relationshipskills  #relationshipstruggles #toxicrelationships #relationshipsgoals #buildingrelationships #relationshipstatus #relationships","NumberOfLikes":1,"Hashtags":["#ex","#pandemic","#covid19","#relationships101","#relationshipstuff","#interracialrelationships","#healthyrelationships","#relationshipskills","#relationshipstruggles","#toxicrelationships","#relationshipsgoals","#buildingrelationships","#relationshipstatus","#relationships"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Samantha Engelbrecht on August 28, 2020.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598643829,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 28 21:43:49 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"honestlyalwayseating","CaptionText":"A little piece of my heart is broken.

I am anxious, guilt ridden, exhausted, and sad. I have tried to keep my two children content and busy, shielding them from the anxiety and worry I feel every single day. In the beginning, I tried keeping the house clean, cooked all of their favorite meals, stayed on top of their \u201Chomeschooling\u201D and tried to make sure they got some exercise.

When you use fear as the tactic to meet your goal, and you have a media pushing that narrative, that #media attention you enjoy, simply embeds images of #violence and abuses in the minds of those sitting at home during a #pandemic trying to protect their families. Those images after two years on bombardment will never go away for most people and will ultimately contribute to those people teaching their #children that #blackpeople are violent and dangerous. That ends up perpetuating the opposite of what BLM is supposedly fighting against. Those people and their children will choose #lawandorder everytime.  72% or 97 Million Americans are identified as non-hispanic white, as opposed to the 12% or 37 million #BlackAmericans being represented by the small #BlackLivesMatter minorty being projected as representatives by media. Add to that the other 20% of #Asian Hispanic, Middle Eastern population seeing the #blackviolence in the name of BLM and you have close to 90% population watching BLM and their views being forever changed. At first sympathetic, latter self protective - making a large percentage of that 90% population suspicious of all #blacks. Just like people who saw Reginald Denny pulled from his truck and beaten for driving his truck delivering products to #Compton in the Rodney King riots, Americans made the decision not to stop and become another #ReginaldDenny given the same circumstances. Thus we now have cars going through people blocking or surrounding cars in #BLM.

The vast majority of offices cannot isolate within a \u201Cbubble,\u201D so companies must plan for the new normal of working around COVID-19. The most effective way for employers to avoid a breakout is by utilizing effective PPE and social distancing measures. 😷\nBeyond PPE and social distancing, there will be a demand for health testing and contact tracing. Both of these preventative measures will require robust data capabilities in order to process the massive influx of employee data. In addition, companies will need to focus on data governance to properly manage the sensitive health information that is collected.

Presidential historian Douglas Brinkley calls Trump, \u201Ca serial liar.\u201D\u2060\nI mean, even freaking Wikipedia says, \u201CDonald Trump has made many false or misleading statements, including thousands during his presidency.

Bring your ID +\/- a piece of mail with your new address if you are moving (some states require you to be a state resident).\n2. Wear your mask and bring sanitizer. There are some items being touched by hundreds of people like the pens, clipboards so you can consider gloves for that. \n3. Want a face shield? Check out @filausa and their new visor shields. Who said you cant be stylish?\n4. Take a picture of your requisition with your phone. When you call asking for results they may ask for these numbers and you may lose the paper. \n5. Keep your mouth covered while testing (just move mask down).\n6. For the actual test, it will be uncomfortable. The deeper it goes and the longer it stays in your nose the more effective the test and the lower the false negative rate. It should be an unpleasant experience but here are my tips for getting through it- find something to hold on to (not the nice testing staff) like your phone or your leg. Tilt your head back and try your best to relax your nostrils. If your nose and throat are tense it hurts so much more. The swab will touch the back of your upper throat and cause you to cough but just breathe through it. The more you tense, the longer it takes. \n7. Congratulations! You took your test. Now reward yourself with ice cream or something similar.\n#pandemic #health #healthcare #coronavirus #covid19 #covidtest #medicine #doctor #surgeon #doctorsofinstagram #healthyliving #healthylifestyle #covidkindness #mask #maskon #maskup #florida #floridalife #healthiswealth","NumberOfLikes":44,"Hashtags":["#COVID","#pandemic","#health","#healthcare","#coronavirus","#covid19","#covidtest","#medicine","#doctor","#surgeon","#doctorsofinstagram","#healthyliving","#healthylifestyle","#covidkindness","#mask","#maskon","#maskup","#florida","#floridalife","#healthiswealth"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Kristin Rojas, M.D. in Tallahassee, Florida with @who, @unicef, @cdcgov, @fda, and @floridahealthdepartment.

Its confirmed virus-related death toll of 9,291 is one-fourth of Britain\u2019s toll, although experts say all numbers understate the true impact of the #pandemic due to various factors.\n\n#Protest organizers had appealed the ban and a regional administrative court ruled Friday that the #rallies could go ahead, saying there was no immediate threat to #publicsafety.

But it's quite predictable. \n\nVidyut Jamwal is just amazing and is seen in a different way. He does fight a lot in the movie but he had to let go of his martial arts and fight like a normal man.

Naposledy jsem o tomhle psal v dřevním květnu 2020, kdy studie WHO spíše vyloučila údajné případy reaktivace v Jižní Koreji. Nyní ale máme první POTVRZENÝ případ tohoto druhu, ale... 😷\n\n2\u20E3 HONGKONGSKÝ PACIENT\nMožnost OPAKOVANÉ NÁKAZY se řešila od počátku pandemie. Z pohledu cynického vědátora platí, že VIRY POMĚRNĚ RYCHLE MUTUJÍ. Nemusí se jednat o mutace, které by měnily biologické vlastnosti viru, může se jednat o mutace neutrální, které nemění vůbec nic, případně mění vir jen poměrně málo. 🧬\n\nKdyž v Hong Kongu v srpnu přistál 33yo muž, který se vracel z Evropy, byl automaticky vyšetřen. Výsledek byl pozitivní. Záznamy ale ukázaly, ze už jednou se s COVIDem léčil, za zdravého byl UZNÁN V POLOVINĚ DUBNA. 👾\n\nProtože byly k dispozici vzorky z obou vyšetření, bylo by škoda nesrovnat sekvence virů. A ukázalo se, že vir z druhého záchytu má tolik různých změn, že POCHÁZÍ Z JINÉ LINIE než u viru z prvního záchytu. 👌\n\n1\u20E3 \u201EAHA, TAKŽE ZASE NIC NEVÍME?\u201C\nOd té doby se potvrdilo jen několik málo podobných případů, takže je BRZY VYVOZOVAT SILNÉ ZÁVĚRY. Dobrou zprávou je skutečnost, že hongkongský pacient NEMĚL ŽÁDNÉ PŘÍZNAKY. Kdyby nedošlo vlivem návratu ze zahraničí na otestování, nový koronavirus by u něj nebyl odhalen. 🤷\u200D♂️\n\nŠpatná zpráva je ale ta, že přirozená nákaza nejspíš nepovede k vytvoření skupinové imunity (#herdimmunity). To neznamená, že by se skupinová imunita vytvořit nemohla - ale bude dosažitelná jen očkováním. Což je pro mnohé jenom další dráždění hada bosou nohou.

A dirlo è l'ONU, in un rapporto dal titolo \u201CPreventing the next pandemic\u201D. Il mondo si sta limitando a trattare i sintomi della pandemia di covid-19, ma non sta curando le cause ambientali che l\u2019hanno scatenata. Questo significa che per il futuro, ci dobbiamo aspettare un flusso continuo di zoonosi dovute ai cosiddetti salti di specie! Anche prima del covid-19, ogni anno ca. 2 milioni di persone morivano di malattie zoonotiche, soprattutto nei paesi più poveri: dall\u2019Ebola a Sars, fino al virus del Nilo occidentale e alla febbre della Rift Valley. Le cause principali della diffusione di questi virus sono la crescente domanda di carne e la conseguente distruzione della natura da parte dell\u2019uomo. Per l\u2019Onu, serve un approccio \u201Cone health\u201D, cioè in grado di tenere insieme la salute umana, animale e ambientale. Ciò è di vitale importanza, ma necessita di molto più monitoraggio e ricerca sulle minacce e sui sistemi alimentari. La fauna selvatica e il bestiame sono la fonte della maggior parte dei virus che infettano gli esseri umani. \"C\u2019è stata una risposta molto forte al Covid-19, ma è stata trattata come una sfida medica e uno shock economico\", ha affermato la prof.ssa Delia Grace (Unep). \"Ma le sue origini sono nell\u2019ambiente, nei sistemi alimentari e nella salute degli animali\u201D. I fattori trainanti di focolai sono la crescente domanda di proteine \u200B\u200Banimali, l\u2019agricoltura intensiva, lo sfruttamento della fauna selvatica, l\u2019aumento dei viaggi globali e la crisi climatica. Sono queste le vere sfide! Un\u2019intensa ondata di attività umane sta colpendo l\u2019ambiente in tutto il pianeta e abbattendo il cuscinetto naturale che una volta proteggeva le persone dagli agenti patogeni. Quest\u2019atteggiamento, però, è molto pericoloso. Il report ONU è l\u2019ultimo severo avvertimento per i governi. La risposta alle zoonosi e alle altre sfide per l\u2019umanità, deve essere la semplice idea che la nostra salute dipende dalla salute del pianeta e delle altre specie. Se l\u2019umanità offrirà alla natura la possibilità di respirare, la natura sarà il nostro più grande alleato per costruire un mondo più giusto, più verde e più sicuro per tutti.","NumberOfLikes":12,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Roberto Mattio on August 28, 2020.

He was the last of the so called 'good' Roman emperors.  During the last 14 years of his life he faced one of the worst plagues in European history. The Antonine Plague, named after him, was probably caused by a strain of the smallpox virus. It\u2019s estimated to have killed up to 5 million people, possibly including Marcus himself.\n\nIn the middle of this plague, Marcus Aurelius wrote a book, known as The Meditations, which records the moral and psychological advice he gave himself at this time. Applying Stoic philosophy to the challenges of coping with pain, illness, anxiety and loss. Its easy to view The Meditations as a manual for developing precisely the resilience skills required to cope with a pandemic.\n\nCognitive behavioural therapy has its roots in the philosophy of the ancient Stoics. Making a distinction between what is and is not under out control can be really helpful. \"What happens to me is never directly under my control, never completely up to me, but my own thoughts and actions are \u2013 at least the voluntary ones.

Within those three words lies a complex web of partnerships, transactions, and logistics. It\u2019s a system that we \u2013 as restaurant-goers \u2013 have taken for granted because it seems to runs effortlessly in the background.\n.\nWith the arrival of COVID-19, our role as unconscious consumers has now come to an end because the systems we have relied on for so long are in jeopardy. Farmers are in trouble and, as you know, so are restaurants. So what\u2019s going on, exactly? How can we help? These questions, and more, were explored in the newest episode of the Food Under Fire podcast. I sat down with Tracy Singleton (owner of @birchwoodcafe in Minneapolis) and Gary Wertish (president of the @mnfarmersunion) to talk about the interrelationship between farms and restaurants and how that system \u2013 invisible to the eyes of consumers \u2013 is under threat. It\u2019s a complex conversation, but we did our best.\n.\nThe full episode is now available on Spotify and Apple Podcasts. Hit the link in my bio for access to both.

I'm Amber, a Child and Family Therapist and mother of two. @connectwithplay is a page dedicated to the parent-child connection. \n\nExperts agree that when a caregiver is able to stay calm during stressful interactions with their child(ren), this will in turn promote self-regulation, a positive sense of self and better mental health overall for the child. \n\nThe issue a lot of us face is the fact that attachment relationships can bring out all of our raw emotions and unmet needs from our own childhood. We can be completely regulated at work and in the community, but lose our control with the people who are closest to us. So, please know that we've all been in a spot where we have lost control as parents. \n\nWhat I always see in parenting information is practical scripts (love these) and relaxation exercises, which is helpful, but if we are coming from a place of unmet needs, we also may not have recieved the skills to really regulate ourselves. Instead we may be continuing the trend of internalizing our emotions. Just as children can only do well with the skills they have, parents can only do their best with the skills they have. \n\nThis post speaks to those skills we may not be using in those difficult moments. It is simply to help provide more in depth way of tending  to ourselves in order to help our child.  Like with any skill, it will take practice. The best thing we can do is keep trying. \n\nPlease let me know if this information helps you.

And the American people, will greet him with one great big, universal, democratic, sheeplike bleat of \u2018O.K., TRUMP! Fix it like you want it fixed. WE TRUST YOU COMPLETELY BIG DADDY PROPHETIC GOD- LIKE FIGURE. \n\nThis is where we have arrived. \n\nWe are living in a government of the profits, by the profits, for the profits at the cost of all human life.\n\nThe Tyrant of the United States has now declared War on his own people. YOU ARE AT WAR AMERICA WITH YOUR OWN GOVERNMENT.  #THEBOX #Icantbreath #Blacklivesmatter #policestate \n#dictatorship #blm #protest #peacefulprotest #detroit #pandemic2020 #pandemic #protesters #k20 #theminute #vlogginglife #mentalhealthawareness #suicideprevention #protest #humanrights #trump #peace #revolution #protest #justiceforgeorgefloyd #nojusticenopeace #thetruthstandsalone #breanataylor #thetruthstandsalone","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#THEBOX","#Icantbreath","#Blacklivesmatter","#policestate","#dictatorship","#blm","#protest","#peacefulprotest","#detroit","#pandemic2020","#pandemic","#protesters","#k20","#theminute","#vlogginglife","#mentalhealthawareness","#suicideprevention","#protest","#humanrights","#trump","#peace","#revolution","#protest","#justiceforgeorgefloyd","#nojusticenopeace","#thetruthstandsalone","#breanataylor","#thetruthstandsalone"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by kirknolandthebox.com on August 28, 2020.
