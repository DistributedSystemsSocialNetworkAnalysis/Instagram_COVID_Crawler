Egan is a surfer, skier, environmental activist, and an alum of the industrial and systems engineering program. She\u2019s also the cofounder and CEO of ecomedes, a company that helps the commercial-building product industry reduce costs and impact through optimized product purchasing. In this episode, she talks about her journey to becoming a CEO, about learning to ask for what she wanted, becoming her authentic self (and finally dropping all the football talk), and how she counters the imposter syndrome that, incredibly, still haunts her. She offers advice for students on how to make the impressions that can give them an edge as they start their careers. And finally, she explains how she found her calling in the business of sustainability, and why she has hope that humanity can act in time to address climate change.

Por causa da pandemia do covid-19, a feira, que deveria ter sido aberta em abril, foi cancelada, provocando uma discussão entre associações que representam as galerias e a direção da SP-Arte pela devolução do dinheiro pago pelo aluguel dos espaços no pavilhão da Bienal. \n\nSegundo Fernanda Feitosa, a SP-Arte devolveu a integralidade dos pagamentos efetuados e diversas galerias, muitas delas expositoras desde a primeira edição e outras recentes, optaram por deixar o crédito para a edição de 2021.\n\nSe há menos galerias na edição virtual, que vai até o dia 30, a perda de alguns participantes foi compensada pela entrada de novos parceiros \u2013 aliás novíssimos, caso da HOA, galeria de arte paulistana fundada este ano pela artista Igi Lola Ayedun, dedicada à arte contemporânea latino-americana, que já usa a internet como ponto operacional. Igualmente criada por artistas e tendo como curadores brasileiros e africanos, a 01.01 Platform promove artistas emergentes com o apoio de instituições do Reino Unido, Portugal e Gana. \n\nTentando uma nova abordagem do mercado, ela propõe uma forma alternativa de colecionismo, que leve em conta a cultura produzida nos países da antiga rota comercial da escravidão.\n\nLink na bio.\n\nFonte: Estadão\n\n#covid19 #coronavirus #ONN #onovonormal #ONNpoliticapublica #covidart #covid2020, #covid19brasil #covidmask #covidphotodiaries #covidnews #covid19art #corona #coronavírus #coronavirusbrazil #coronaviruspandemic #coronavirusoutbreak #coronavirus2020 #pandemic #pandemicart #pandemic2020, #pandemicorona #pandemiclife #fiqueemcasa #futuro #reuniaoonline #homeoffice #trabalhandoemcasa #emcasa","NumberOfLikes":10,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#coronavirus","#ONN","#onovonormal","#ONNpoliticapublica","#covidart","#covid2020,","#covid19brasil","#covidmask","#covidphotodiaries","#covidnews","#covid19art","#corona","#coronavírus","#coronavirusbrazil","#coronaviruspandemic","#coronavirusoutbreak","#coronavirus2020","#pandemic","#pandemicart","#pandemic2020,","#pandemicorona","#pandemiclife","#fiqueemcasa","#futuro","#reuniaoonline","#homeoffice","#trabalhandoemcasa","#emcasa"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by O Novo Normal in São Paulo, Brazil.

It feels like everything is on pause but political fundraising cannot stop. \u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nHere are 5 ways your political organization can raise money in the midst of a global pandemic. \u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\n 1) Live Stream a Pajama Ball or Virtual Gala\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nWith a little creative use of Social Media capabilities, you have the ability to live to stream your event to your audience or \u201Cattendees\u201D. You can incorporate Q&A sessions so that attendees can participate from the comfort and safety of their own home- as dressed up or dressed down as they wish.\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\n2) Host a Webinar\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nInvite your supporters to a virtual town hall or webinar, where they can view live sessions with the CEO and Board.

Moving along, chugging along, riding the bumps and turns, at the end of the day sleep overtaking the exhaustion of living in these times.\n\nSometimes we all live our lives in a small bubble, I do too. Everything outside is abstract, and not real, we do not understand it completely. While that bubble might mask us all from the worries outside or right now the raging pandemic gripping this world, it actually hurts the most when the bubble bursts and everything hits home and brings a cloud of anxiety and confusion.\n\nSo I urge you all, to take this seriously(if you are not). Pandemic isn't over yet, far from it. It's high time for all who are carelessly or unknowingly ignoring this to WAKE UP.\n\nEverything pushes me down these days, and it's fine. But just like everyday, you show up, make the best of what you can. Like this weekend, we went for a short hike with the boys and the weather was just perfect. While they explored the woods, we awed in their little joys, super proud of how much they are growing and learning every single day, despite being home.\n\nYes life keeps going, pandemic or not.  We have a busy week ahead with lots of stuff planned before the school starts in September. Never did I imagine that my little boy will start his first school year like this, but it is what it is.\n\nWhat are your plans before schools start? How are you feeling about it all?\n\nHave a great week everyone.\n\n#Mondays #mondaymotivation #pandemictimes #pandemic #covid19 #school #kindergarten #firstyearofschool\n#foodblogger #momblogger #browngirlwrites #brownmoms #boymama #parentinginapandemic #parenting #motherhood #hiking #weekendplans #hikingwithmyboys","NumberOfLikes":130,"Hashtags":["#Mondays","#mondaymotivation","#pandemictimes","#pandemic","#covid19","#school","#kindergarten","#firstyearofschool","#foodblogger","#momblogger","#browngirlwrites","#brownmoms","#boymama","#parentinginapandemic","#parenting","#motherhood","#hiking","#weekendplans","#hikingwithmyboys"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Pankti | food & motherhood on August 24, 2020.

Multiple studies repeatedly show that the quality of our relationships is the single most important factor for our overall health. \n.\n.\nRelationships are how we learn, grow, evolve and heal. They are our safe haven when the world feels like chaos. We learn how to love ourselves by the way others show us love. Nothing can replace your loved ones. No amount of money can replace the memories you have with those who you cherish. When you look back on your life in your old age, it is the time spent with your family, friends, partner, etc. that you will remember with the most joy. As we start this week, ask yourself: how am I watering my relationships this week? Maybe it\u2019s making that call to your parents, catching up with a friend over dinner or giving your partner or child your undivided attention. Whatever it is, make it worth it and look at it like a health promoting behavior. \n.\n.\n#mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #covid19 #pandemic #trauma #traumarecovery #healing #wellness #therapy #therapist #therapistsofinstagram #relationships #relationshipquotes #love #friendship #personalgrowth #selfcare #2020 #recovery #recoverywarriors #marriage #dating","NumberOfLikes":16,"Hashtags":["#mentalhealth","#mentalhealthawareness","#covid19","#pandemic","#trauma","#traumarecovery","#healing","#wellness","#therapy","#therapist","#therapistsofinstagram","#relationships","#relationshipquotes","#love","#friendship","#personalgrowth","#selfcare","#2020","#recovery","#recoverywarriors","#marriage","#dating"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Allyson, MA, APCC in San Diego, California.

Of the 27 papers reviewed, the most commonly mentioned interventions were stress and anger or coping skills, returning to duty, physical training and sleep hygiene. Occupational therapists are well suited to enable military veterans to build upon their existing strengths, skills and professional identities to minimise the impact of PTSD on daily life and to reach their full potential.\n\n#JauntyJournal #OTJournalclub #occupationaltherapy #occupationaltherapist #researchinOT #ot #pandemic #depression #occupationaltherapyanddepression #otandmilitaryservices #mentalhealth #occupationaltherapyresearch #evidencebasedpractice #occupationaltherapypracticeframework #occupationaltherapyassistant #occupationaltherapystudent #occupationaltherapymonth #iph #nild #svnirtar #aiota #otindia #occupationaltherapyawareness  #occupationaltherapylove #occupationaltherapydaily #occupationaltherapyindia #occupationaltherapyworld #occupationaltherapyworks #occupationaltherapyadvocate","NumberOfLikes":61,"Hashtags":["#JauntyJournal","#OTJournalclub","#occupationaltherapy","#occupationaltherapist","#researchinOT","#ot","#pandemic","#depression","#occupationaltherapyanddepression","#otandmilitaryservices","#mentalhealth","#occupationaltherapyresearch","#evidencebasedpractice","#occupationaltherapypracticeframework","#occupationaltherapyassistant","#occupationaltherapystudent","#occupationaltherapymonth","#iph","#nild","#svnirtar","#aiota","#otindia","#occupationaltherapyawareness","#occupationaltherapylove","#occupationaltherapydaily","#occupationaltherapyindia","#occupationaltherapyworld","#occupationaltherapyworks","#occupationaltherapyadvocate"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by OT - A Ray of Hope on August 24, 2020 tagging @shannenmarie_ot, @occupationaltherapydaily, @the.occupational.therapy.hub, @occupationaltherapyconcept, @wtf_is_ot, @occupational_therapy2020, @thebrainyot, @ot.enlightenment, @thefit_ot_nyc, @otexaminsights, @otresearchcorner, @otgraphically, @theotplatform, @otpractitionersforsolidarity, @justaspot.ot.withlibby, and @iknowa.spot.

The coronavirus pandemic has finally changed that trajectory.\n⠀\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates that meat production\u2014a decent proxy for consumption\u2014dropped in 2019, and it forecasts a decline again this year. Last year was only the second since 1961 in which production fell; two consecutive years of decline is unprecedented and could be the start of something durable.\"\n\nMeat consumption changes in tandem with two factors: population and overall wealth. Growth in the former is slowing; the coronavirus pandemic certainly impacts the latter, although meat production didn\u2019t fall even during the global financial crisis.\n\nWe sincerely hope that animal flesh consumption slows down or even better, stops once and for all. Hopefully, not solely due to a pandemic or financial crisis, but primarily because humans need to realize that animals are not here for us to eat them. Eating animals is a real threat to humanity, animals and the environment.\n\nWe must find a way to live in harmony with other species, by not being a threat to them. We must recognize that they have the right to live here and we need to respect them as individuals.\n\nVia @awellfedworld\n\nRead more in this article 👇\n\nhttps:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2020-07-30\/good-news-for-climate-change-as-world-loses-its-taste-for-meat?fbclid=IwAR3gNGKZfICet3TF_IJPt8f_-SwIGtMIuMgN7nrTjoqx3KRXmwXvhZtZSqA\n\n#animalrights #animalrightactivists #meatisnotessential #cancelanimalag #animalagticulture #climatechange #climatechangeisreal #globalwarming #plantbasedfood #plantpowered #veganfortheanimals #veganlifestyle #veganism #dairyfree #meatfree #awellfedworld #eggfree #covid_19 #pandemic #coronavirus #dxe #dxesandiego","NumberOfLikes":104,"Hashtags":["#COVID19","#animalrights","#animalrightactivists","#meatisnotessential","#cancelanimalag","#animalagticulture","#climatechange","#climatechangeisreal","#globalwarming","#plantbasedfood","#plantpowered","#veganfortheanimals","#veganlifestyle","#veganism","#dairyfree","#meatfree","#awellfedworld","#eggfree","#covid_19","#pandemic","#coronavirus","#dxe","#dxesandiego"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by DxE San Diego on August 24, 2020.

I asked a store clerk where they might be. He pointed to an aisle, and as he turned, I happened to see these words written across his mask: I AM NOT AFRAID.\n\nHe was a slight, unassuming guy who looked like he spent most of his time indoors. He didn\u2019t look like the type to sit down at his desk and use a Sharpie to boldly write this declaration.\n\nI said, \u201CI like your mask.\u201D\n\nLifting his chin, his eyes squinted.\n\n~*~\n\nAt the beginning of summer, I met a beautiful and strong Chinese American missionary who had served as the interpreter for a Chinese evangelist named Brother Yun.\n\nBrother Yun had been brutally tortured, imprisoned, and starved for his beliefs. But his mantra throughout that experience had been, written phonetically, \u201CBoo yaw pa. Yea sue eye knee.\u201D\n\nDo not fear.

NO!! They are putting so much in the line in order to stand up for us and what it right! ❤️\n\nSo why are they trying to push an unsafe experimental vaccine into the global community - which the Australian government want to make mandatory??

This was 30 days after their first identified case.\n\nNZ maintained a nationwide lockdown for five weeks before transitioning to an Alert Level 3, which equates to a national stay-at-home order for an additional 2 weeks.\n\nIn early May, the last known case of COVID-19 was identified and the patient was placed in isolation, thereby eliminating community spread.\n\nNZ\u2019s total case count was 1569 with 22 total deaths. Their case fatality rate is 0.45% with mortality rate of 0.45 per 100K people. For comparison, the case fatality rate in the US is 3.1% with mortality rate of 54 per 100K people.\n\nDuring the lockdown the government instituted a spending program to support business and to supplement income lost by employees.\n\nThere are several important lessons that arise from NZ\u2019s COVID-19 response:\n💫Early national government action was critical to the successful elimination of COVID-19.\n💫Positive messaging provided by the PM about unifying their nation led to high public confidence and adherence to their strategy.\n💫There need to be strong public health measures in place to address future threats.\n\nRestrictions were the eased, but certain measures were kept in place including tight border controls, quarantining citizens who return from travel abroad, and protective equipment for all airports and seaports.\n\nUnfortunately, after 3 months with no new cases, 4 new cases of COVID-19 had been identified on August 11 in Auckland. Auckland was put into lockdown the very next day and contact tracing strategies were then implemented which identified another 65 cases connected to the original 4 cases. Although there are theories about how another outbreak may have occurred, there are no clear answers at this time.\n\n𝑊ℎ𝑎𝑡 𝑎𝑟𝑒 𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑟 𝑡ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑠 𝑜𝑛 𝑁𝑍'𝑠 𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑚 𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑔𝑦? ✨","NumberOfLikes":521,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":91,"Timestamp":1598273603,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 24 14:53:23 CEST 2020","Location":"Piedmont Park ATL"},{"CaptionText":"#repost #funny #haha #lol #lolz #joke #justjokes # #repost #funny #justkidding #hilarious #jokes #lmao #liveoutloud #😂 #bahaha  #covid #coronavirus #pandemic #2020","NumberOfLikes":11,"Hashtags":["#repost","#funny","#haha","#lol","#lolz","#joke","#justjokes","#repost","#funny","#justkidding","#hilarious","#jokes","#lmao","#liveoutloud","#😂","#bahaha","#covid","#coronavirus","#pandemic","#2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by 🦋Melisa🦋 on August 24, 2020.

She fought the pandemic with superior will-power and accurately following the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts as instructed by the doctors.\nHer husband Dhanesh experienced symptoms of fever. As a precautionary measure, he decided to get his check-up done. Unfortunately, the tests revealed that he is #COVIDpositive. The couple immediately coordinated with the BMC for help in staying quarantined. There were rumours about them ordering food from outside and throwing parties which spread across their building. \nWith the help and assurance of their landlord and the BMC, they took the necessary precautions and began home quarantine after having the house sanitised, following which they stayed in regular contact with the BMC to navigate the situation.\nThe main thing the body requires to combat this, as they discovered; was a lot of rest and proper nutrition, as the immune system fights it off. Sophia herself showed no symptoms. Post completion of their quarantine period, they got tested at Cooper Hospital, Juhu where they were pronounced fully recovered.\nThrough proper coordination with the authorities, doctors, proper rest and nutrition, along with supportive friends, they got through this difficult period. If you know someone who has tested positive, reach out to them and show your support and positivity. It helps more than you know!

Owing to the extreme deflation of demand and cheap imports rushing into the market, the paper industry in the country is currently operating at less than 50% capacity utilization.\n\n\u201CThe paper sector in the country, which recorded the progress of about 5-6% in the previous fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, can potentially see a de-growth in this financial year with poor sales volumes in the first quarter and the continuing second quarter, where the state has not dramatically upgraded. \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.#pandemic #paperindustry #paperrecycling #wastepaper #papermill #lockdown #globalmarket #recyclingindustry #business #pulpandpaper #paperbag #marketanalysis #kraftpaper #paperindustry #recession #paperexport","NumberOfLikes":23,"Hashtags":["#pandemic","#paperindustry","#paperrecycling","#wastepaper","#papermill","#lockdown","#globalmarket","#recyclingindustry","#business","#pulpandpaper","#paperbag","#marketanalysis","#kraftpaper","#paperindustry","#recession","#paperexport"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Knam Buzz on August 24, 2020.

Apart from going to school, I also have to help my mother to do activities at home, such as cutting grass to feed the cows, finding firewood for cooking and helping my mother to cook with very simple tools.\n\nAs a student, I also have to do school assignments that are currently being done online. This is a new experience for me, and quite difficult too, because in the area where I live, there is no internet signal. Every Monday, Wednesday and Friday I have to go up the hill to find a signal, all subject areas are sent through the WhatsApp group by the teachers on a predetermined schedule. Sometimes the signal is not good and I have to learn by enduring hunger on the hill. This did not reduce my enthusiasm for learning, because when I returned home, my parents always advised me that it was very important for me to continue to study for a better future, especially since my parents never went to school because they had no chance as there wasn\u2019t a school when they were children.\n\nIn the midst of the difficulties of life, my school friends and I feel lucky, because every month I am assisted with foodstuffs of rice, green beans, dried fish and cooking oil by EBPP; now I have received assistance four times!\n\nI would like to thank all my teachers and parents, who have always guided and encouraged me to learn during this difficult time of the coronavirus pandemic. I would also like to thank all the donors who have helped provide food for me and all my friends. I really hope that this pandemic will pass quickly, so I can go back to studying at school with my friends.

Following this news, KAMI learned that a former OFW chef has recently been making headlines after he lost his job and opted to sell food on the streets as a new source of income amid the pandemic. \n.\n.\n\nAccording to the report done by Manal Sugadol on GMA-7's 'Stand For Truth', Rain Paul Cervantes, who was previously a cruise ship chef, is now an ambulant vendor. \u201CSa una po talagang aaminin ko nahiya po talaga ako na ganito yung ginagawa ko na dati isa akong chef sa barko tapos nang nangyari yung ganito. \"Diyan na lang po ako sa labas, nagtitinda, marami pong nakatingin na bakit naging ganyan,\u201D Rain shared. \n.\nFurthermore, Rain revealed that being an ambulant vendor is not his only source of income. \n.\n\u201CSo naisipan ko po na mag negosyo muna po ng paglalako ng isda.
