Egan is a surfer, skier, environmental activist, and an alum of the industrial and systems engineering program. She\u2019s also the cofounder and CEO of ecomedes, a company that helps the commercial-building product industry reduce costs and impact through optimized product purchasing. In this episode, she talks about her journey to becoming a CEO, about learning to ask for what she wanted, becoming her authentic self (and finally dropping all the football talk), and how she counters the imposter syndrome that, incredibly, still haunts her. She offers advice for students on how to make the impressions that can give them an edge as they start their careers. And finally, she explains how she found her calling in the business of sustainability, and why she has hope that humanity can act in time to address climate change.

Jun, however, participated in the demonstration even though he had to be quarantined. And, many demonstrators didn't wear face masks during the demonstration.

Jun, who tested positive, is still demonising the left-leaning government.\nRead more at: https:\/\/medium.com\/@iufcsol0122\/in-south-korea-a-populist-pastor-and-his-followers-are-spreading-covid-19-and-the-anti-government-83c556f0b7d1","NumberOfLikes":9,"Hashtags":["#Covid19","#Coronavirus","#Pandemic"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598282833,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 24 17:27:13 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"It\u2019s another beautiful day, time to get out and go get \u2018em! \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n#sunrise #chicago #pandemic #sheddaquarium #thecablephotographer #museumcampus #shotonsony","NumberOfLikes":18,"Hashtags":["#sunrise","#chicago","#pandemic","#sheddaquarium","#thecablephotographer","#museumcampus","#shotonsony"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Wayne Cable in Museum Campus.

Moving along, chugging along, riding the bumps and turns, at the end of the day sleep overtaking the exhaustion of living in these times.\n\nSometimes we all live our lives in a small bubble, I do too. Everything outside is abstract, and not real, we do not understand it completely. While that bubble might mask us all from the worries outside or right now the raging pandemic gripping this world, it actually hurts the most when the bubble bursts and everything hits home and brings a cloud of anxiety and confusion.\n\nSo I urge you all, to take this seriously(if you are not). Pandemic isn't over yet, far from it. It's high time for all who are carelessly or unknowingly ignoring this to WAKE UP.\n\nEverything pushes me down these days, and it's fine. But just like everyday, you show up, make the best of what you can. Like this weekend, we went for a short hike with the boys and the weather was just perfect. While they explored the woods, we awed in their little joys, super proud of how much they are growing and learning every single day, despite being home.\n\nYes life keeps going, pandemic or not.  We have a busy week ahead with lots of stuff planned before the school starts in September. Never did I imagine that my little boy will start his first school year like this, but it is what it is.\n\nWhat are your plans before schools start? How are you feeling about it all?\n\nHave a great week everyone.\n\n#Mondays #mondaymotivation #pandemictimes #pandemic #covid19 #school #kindergarten #firstyearofschool\n#foodblogger #momblogger #browngirlwrites #brownmoms #boymama #parentinginapandemic #parenting #motherhood #hiking #weekendplans #hikingwithmyboys","NumberOfLikes":130,"Hashtags":["#Mondays","#mondaymotivation","#pandemictimes","#pandemic","#covid19","#school","#kindergarten","#firstyearofschool","#foodblogger","#momblogger","#browngirlwrites","#brownmoms","#boymama","#parentinginapandemic","#parenting","#motherhood","#hiking","#weekendplans","#hikingwithmyboys"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Pankti | food & motherhood on August 24, 2020.

They are our safe haven when the world feels like chaos. We learn how to love ourselves by the way others show us love. Nothing can replace your loved ones. No amount of money can replace the memories you have with those who you cherish. When you look back on your life in your old age, it is the time spent with your family, friends, partner, etc. that you will remember with the most joy.

The coronavirus pandemic has finally changed that trajectory.\n‚†Ä\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates that meat production\u2014a decent proxy for consumption\u2014dropped in 2019, and it forecasts a decline again this year. Last year was only the second since 1961 in which production fell; two consecutive years of decline is unprecedented and could be the start of something durable.\"\n\nMeat consumption changes in tandem with two factors: population and overall wealth. Growth in the former is slowing; the coronavirus pandemic certainly impacts the latter, although meat production didn\u2019t fall even during the global financial crisis.\n\nWe sincerely hope that animal flesh consumption slows down or even better, stops once and for all. Hopefully, not solely due to a pandemic or financial crisis, but primarily because humans need to realize that animals are not here for us to eat them. Eating animals is a real threat to humanity, animals and the environment.\n\nWe must find a way to live in harmony with other species, by not being a threat to them.

I asked a store clerk where they might be. He pointed to an aisle, and as he turned, I happened to see these words written across his mask: I AM NOT AFRAID.\n\nHe was a slight, unassuming guy who looked like he spent most of his time indoors.

This was 30 days after their first identified case.\n\nNZ maintained a nationwide lockdown for five weeks before transitioning to an Alert Level 3, which equates to a national stay-at-home order for an additional 2 weeks.\n\nIn early May, the last known case of COVID-19 was identified and the patient was placed in isolation, thereby eliminating community spread.\n\nNZ\u2019s total case count was 1569 with 22 total deaths. Their case fatality rate is 0.45% with mortality rate of 0.45 per 100K people.

Here\u2019s what his lovely parents have to say about his birth with the support of a virtual doula. \n\n\u201COdile was our doula during this pandemic, and we are so thankful for her. COVID changed our original plans of having Odile\u2019s in-person help, but regardless, her virtual assistance was still invaluable. It\u2019s clear she cares deeply about her clients. She provided wonderful prenatal guidance leading up to my delivery, and provided an encouraging, supportive voice during my son\u2019s birth. I had a very long exhausting labor, and when I was too tired to articulate what I needed or was feeling, I know my husband really appreciated having her virtual guidance and coaching so he could be a better support person for me.

She fought the pandemic with superior will-power and accurately following the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts as instructed by the doctors.\nHer husband Dhanesh experienced symptoms of fever. As a precautionary measure, he decided to get his check-up done. Unfortunately, the tests revealed that he is #COVIDpositive. The couple immediately coordinated with the BMC for help in staying quarantined. There were rumours about them ordering food from outside and throwing parties which spread across their building. \nWith the help and assurance of their landlord and the BMC, they took the necessary precautions and began home quarantine after having the house sanitised, following which they stayed in regular contact with the BMC to navigate the situation.\nThe main thing the body requires to combat this, as they discovered; was a lot of rest and proper nutrition, as the immune system fights it off. Sophia herself showed no symptoms. Post completion of their quarantine period, they got tested at Cooper Hospital, Juhu where they were pronounced fully recovered.\nThrough proper coordination with the authorities, doctors, proper rest and nutrition, along with supportive friends, they got through this difficult period. If you know someone who has tested positive, reach out to them and show your support and positivity. It helps more than you know!

Chegando a um peso e aÃÄ um corpo que eu nunca tive na vida. Mais do que um nuÃÅmero na balancÃßa, mexeu muito com minha autoestima, minha relacÃßaÃÉo comigo mesma e minha relacÃßaÃÉo com o espelho ficou peÃÅssima. \nE eu, super vaidosa que sou (quem me conhece sabe), passei a me sentir feia e com isso insegura, insuficiente, inuÃÅtil, fraca por saber que estava sendo sabotada por mim mesma e naÃÉo estar fazendo nada. \nDurante esse periÃÅodo de isolamento em casa, soÃÅ estava usando roupas mais confortaÃÅveis como camisetas e leggings, claro que sabia no meu inconsciente que estava comendo muito, mais do que o normal, comendo mal e com pouquiÃÅssima atividade fiÃÅsica; consequentemente aumentando de peso. 90% do meu dia se dividia entre estar sentada ou deitada. \nO mais engracÃßado foi como eu tive o \u201Cstart\u201D da minha real situacÃßaÃÉo. \nEm junho fiz uma viagem aÃÄ trabalho e levei jeans na mala.

Nesse exato momento eu tive cieÃÇncia do quaÃÉo fora da curva eu estava. Tentei \u201Cabstrair\u201D e deixei para laÃÅ. \nVoltei da viagem disposta a mudar minha conduta alimentar e rotina de atividade fiÃÅsica, decidi tracÃßar um plano. Marquei uma consulta com a nutricionista para cuidar dessa parte alimentar e como profissional montei meu treino. \nChegou o dia da minha consulta e o que eu jaÃÅ sabia se confirmou: meu percentual de gordura estava aleÃÅm do que era esperado.\n\n#pandemia #isolamentosocial #ansiedades #stress #pandemic #isolation #anxiety #mindset #training #fitness #motivation #workout #life","NumberOfLikes":30,"Hashtags":["#pandemia","#isolamentosocial","#ansiedades","#stress","#pandemic","#isolation","#anxiety","#mindset","#training","#fitness","#motivation","#workout","#life"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Daniela Cesario ü¶ãüåªü¶Å on August 24, 2020.","NumberOfComments":9,"Timestamp":1598266706,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 24 12:58:26 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.\n#wearamask #wearadamnmask #theshining #stanleykubrick #kubrick #allworkandnoplaymakesjackadullboy #redrum #jacknicholson #stephenking #etsy #shopsmall #shopsmallbusiness #horror #horrormovies #horrorfan #horrorfilm #horrorjunkie #covid19 #pandemic #covid_19","NumberOfLikes":32,"Hashtags":["#wearamask","#wearadamnmask","#theshining","#stanleykubrick","#kubrick","#allworkandnoplaymakesjackadullboy","#redrum","#jacknicholson","#stephenking","#etsy","#shopsmall","#shopsmallbusiness","#horror","#horrormovies","#horrorfan","#horrorfilm","#horrorjunkie","#covid19","#pandemic","#covid_19"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Chlo√´ üåô on August 24, 2020.

With the help and support of our dear travellers and patrons we organized donation drives in the national parks to distribute food ration kits to the families of guides, drivers, gate staff, contractual labour and hotel staff. Till date we have distributed over 700 such kits in Kanha, Pench, Kaziranga and Manas.\nAnd we hope to keep doing so in the days to come.\nA big thank you to everyone who has helped us in this noble cause.\nIf you would like to contribute to our future donation drives, get in touch with us soon!\n\n#beyondwild #nature #wildlife #wildlifephotography #nationalpark #forests #jungle #india #donation #pandemic #covid19 #lockdown #quarantine #travel #tourism #travelphotography #travelgram #photography #conservation #natgeo #animalplanet #igers #instagood #instamood #tigers #kanha #animalsofinstagram #kaziranga #wildlifeconservation","NumberOfLikes":40,"Hashtags":["#beyondwild","#nature","#wildlife","#wildlifephotography","#nationalpark","#forests","#jungle","#india","#donation","#pandemic","#covid19","#lockdown","#quarantine","#travel","#tourism","#travelphotography","#travelgram","#photography","#conservation","#natgeo","#animalplanet","#igers","#instagood","#instamood","#tigers","#kanha","#animalsofinstagram","#kaziranga","#wildlifeconservation"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1598265401,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 24 12:36:41 CEST 2020","Location":"India"},{"CaptionText":"You can pre-order Microsoft's Surface Duo foldable phone today\n\nWe had an inkling that the Surface Duo would be coming soon, and \u2014 after letting things slip a little early \u2014 Microsoft just confirmed it.

Professors\rfrom these Universities, who will be leading design studios that address Architecture and\r Urban Design for Disaster Risk Reduction and Resilience are the core members of ArcDR3\rInitiative. Each participant depicted their local context-based strategies to tackle the their\rlocal risks. The event was divided into three panels, plus introduction and closing remarks\rby the general coordinators. Opening remarks we're undertaken by Professors Hitoshi Abe,\rexpert and director of xLAB at UCLA and Fumihiko Imamura, tsunami expert and director of\rthe International Research Institute of Disaster Science (IRIDeS).

Apart from going to school, I also have to help my mother to do activities at home, such as cutting grass to feed the cows, finding firewood for cooking and helping my mother to cook with very simple tools.\n\nAs a student, I also have to do school assignments that are currently being done online. This is a new experience for me, and quite difficult too, because in the area where I live, there is no internet signal. Every Monday, Wednesday and Friday I have to go up the hill to find a signal, all subject areas are sent through the WhatsApp group by the teachers on a predetermined schedule. Sometimes the signal is not good and I have to learn by enduring hunger on the hill. This did not reduce my enthusiasm for learning, because when I returned home, my parents always advised me that it was very important for me to continue to study for a better future, especially since my parents never went to school because they had no chance as there wasn\u2019t a school when they were children.\n\nIn the midst of the difficulties of life, my school friends and I feel lucky, because every month I am assisted with foodstuffs of rice, green beans, dried fish and cooking oil by EBPP; now I have received assistance four times!\n\nI would like to thank all my teachers and parents, who have always guided and encouraged me to learn during this difficult time of the coronavirus pandemic. I would also like to thank all the donors who have helped provide food for me and all my friends. I really hope that this pandemic will pass quickly, so I can go back to studying at school with my friends.
