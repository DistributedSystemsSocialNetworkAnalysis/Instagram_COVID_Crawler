Using data compiled by Araz Chiloyan (@arazchilo ), we were able to create a graph showing COVID-19 trends along with health policy decisions. \n.\n\nWhat is the takeaway here? When restrictions were lifted in April, cases continued to increase: we see a jump in weekly average cases 2-3 weeks after this policy. In early June, enforcement of mask wearing and public health policies became more strict, and about three weeks later we begin to see average weekly cases consistently declining even up until this past week. \n.\n\nSo why is there a 2-3 week delay between policy enactment and a change in trends? Remember that COVID-19 symptoms can take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to the virus, so someone exposed right when a restriction was implemented may go in for testing up to 2 weeks later. Additionally, it takes some time for individuals to adjust behavior after policy change.\n.\n\nIn summary, social distancing and mask wearing works!

That after December, it will magically get better. However, that could not be further from the truth; thinking that it is, is dangerous.\n\nWhat we are seeing and experiencing: pandemic; natural disasters and out-of-control wildfires; injustice; and unrest--is simply the beginning of a new normal. A paradigm shift in the stability of our habit: Earth. While they may seem like separate events, they are all connected.\n\nRemember the unprecedented wildfires that occurred in Australia in January? What is currently happening now in California is simply the flipside of the hemispherical coin. And it's only going to get worse. Instances like these; the hurricanes approaching the Gulf; and the unclassified windstorms in the Midwest will continue to amplify every other systemic problem that we face.\n\nWhat is the solution? In broad strokes, unity. We must end the radical polarization that currently divides us through a strategic, empathetic and compassionate approach that puts the good of all humans, our habitat, and co-inhabitors (animals and plants) first--instead of unfettered corporate profits, executive bonuses, and concentration of power.\n\nThose last aspects can only be controlled through policy; we have the power to directly elect the representatives who will be agents of change. Don't like who you see on the ballot? Then it's time to step up. The necessary changes must occur from the inside. Who is going to answer the call?\n\nüì∑: @xtine.lotus watches the sun set behind Desolation Wilderness's Sierra Crest on Wednesday.

It\u2019s a great resource for city dwellers; it offers ideas for local activities and trips, and features NYC artists\/writers. This sculpture is old but Seeing it makes me nostalgic for my daily 7 train commutes.\n\nPosted @withregram \u2022 @epicenter_nyc This week, we are featuring Linda M. Ganjian, @lindaganjian a Queens-based artist who works in a variety of materials, including clay, cement and paper. Her main pursuit has involved making large \u201Ctabletop\u201D sculptures, composed of hundreds of miniature forms, that are a reinterpretation of Middle Eastern and American craft traditions (carpets, quilts, calligraphy). Much of her work presents memories and impressions of the urban landscape, the specific history of a site or more personal narratives. \n\n\u201C7 Train Panoramas\u201D is a sculptural interpretation of the rooftop architecture visible from the 7 train, organized into a quilt-like structure. The forms (made from clay and painted paper-board) reflect the haphazard array of satellite dishes, antenna, skylights, vents, barbed wire, graffiti, etc., she says, \"that mark the landscape my eyes glaze over on my daily commute.\"\n\nWe want to see, hear, feel, support your art and response to this moment.

This can be done in a baby carrier or while taking a bath together as well! \n\n‚ñ™Ô∏èWith stress levels running high and deep exhaustion setting in, we have to do what we can to take care of ourselves.

But when both parents are gone, it's like shit, I have to do this myself.\" \n\nAs part of my healing in the aftermath of my Dad's death, I've started reading books on being an #adultorphan. \n\nIt's been two months since his death and while there are similarities to when my mom died, it's also different. When the public condolences stopped with mom's death, I had my father. Granted, Dad was a wreck in the first year after Mom died as my brother @nizmlaverite can attest to, but Dad was there for us. Now? It's weird and lonely at times. \n\nIn a culture that doesn't handle death well, our attitudes and responses to loss are immature at best. But when you lose the last parent, the reality of death is no longer distant. It's real. The #pandemic doesn't help since I can't visit with my Dad's siblings or even be with my son and brother. Thankfully, I've got a kick ass therapist, faith and my spiritual practices. That said, some days are better than others. I miss knowing that I could call or text my Dad to talk about anything. Dad was an avid follower of politics and no doubt, last week, he would have been bending my ear about the Democratic Convention. \n\nYet the natural order of life is that our parents leave this dusty rock before we do. It doesn't make it any less lonely, but having just finished this book, it helps to know that what I'm feeling is part of my own #grief and maturation into the last ladder of fully grown. Damn!

We start to forget, and determination can start to waver.\n\nThat\u2019s why ultra-runners often carry with them a little something to help them remember why they decided to do this run in the first place.\n\nWhen I showed up for my first ultra at the Big Red Run in 2017, I packed these 6 ziplocks for 6 days of attempting to cover 250 kilometres across the Simpson Desert. I had no idea what I had signed up for. But my intuition was telling me that I would need something on each day to help me hang on.\n\nDuring one of the low points at Tahoe, just past Armstrong Pass, I read the notes from Rohit @sunraina and Kat that Meg @mey.mey23 had dropped into my bag before the race. They got me going again when all I wanted to do was sleeping for weeks. On the final night heading towards the final checkpoint at Stephen Jones, I remembered a champion track runner talking about skipping when the body gets weary over 6-day championships. I started skipping and found joy again in running. I shared the exuberance with Jenna @jennabrook87 , to whom I had told the same story during her epic 4,500km Running4Bums journey across Australia. Our light banter got me through the fourth sleepless night. \n\nAt Delirious, running with my kind brother Andrew Westwick @andrew.westwick , as we stood on a high point waiting for the sun to set, the memories of my late brother became a source of strength.\n\nI have seen runners carrying photos of their children, partners and grandchildren in their chest.\n\nAs our esteemed Premier said, \u201C[The pandemic] is an ultra-marathon\u201D ü§î, we all know that life is not a sprint.

One day we will look back and what is created during this period will serve as critical reminders, as pieces of a puzzling history yet to fully take shape. Though there is much darkness in many of my recent creations, that vulnerable honesty will serve as a truthful testimony to the struggles of our time as life marches on and new historical records are painted upon the canvas of what may come.\n\nThis is a wonderful, though difficult time to create. One day, as so many times before in the history of art and culture, we will look back and have these treasures to remember what we went through, and what we survived. For that reason, this is also a wonderful time to collect art, to collect pieces of that history as it is forming. One day you will look back and have these creations to remember this time, a time that none of us are likely to ever forget. In remembering these times though, why not remember the difficult and painful beauties that came of it...the roses that grew from the cracks...the little things that offered hope and light when we needed it most amidst the darkness of 2020. \n\nMessage me for inquiries and check out much more at CariniArts.com\n\n#CariniArts #AcrylicAlchemy #MichaelCarini #art #arts #artist #artistsoninstagram #artistsofinstagram #instaart #instaartist #pandemic #covid19 #coronavirus #arthistory #sandiego #culture #community #inspiration #hope #dreamer","NumberOfLikes":95,"Hashtags":["#CariniArts","#AcrylicAlchemy","#MichaelCarini","#art","#arts","#artist","#artistsoninstagram","#artistsofinstagram","#instaart","#instaartist","#pandemic","#covid19","#coronavirus","#arthistory","#sandiego","#culture","#community","#inspiration","#hope","#dreamer"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Michael Carini | Carini Arts on August 23, 2020.","NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598229325,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 24 02:35:25 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Jersey nights with bae\n.\n\n#sundayvibes\n#sundayfunday\n#blacklivesmatter \n#pandemic\n#itsgoingtobeaparty\n#nyc\n#happyjuneteenth\n#birthdaybehavior\n#nycclubs\n#blm \n#icantbreathe \n#georgefloyd \n#ahmaudarbery\n#breonnataylor\n#teamburbanlyfe","NumberOfLikes":9,"Hashtags":["#sundayvibes","#sundayfunday","#blacklivesmatter","#pandemic","#itsgoingtobeaparty","#nyc","#happyjuneteenth","#birthdaybehavior","#nycclubs","#blm","#icantbreathe","#georgefloyd","#ahmaudarbery","#breonnataylor","#teamburbanlyfe"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1598229317,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 24 02:35:17 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"„Éö„Çπ„ÉàÂåªÂ∏´„ÅÆ„Éì„Éº„Ç∫„É¢„ÉÅ„Éº„Éï„ÄÇÂÖ®„ÅèÂ¨â„Åó„Åè„Å™„ÅÑ„Éë„É≥„Éá„Éü„ÉÉ„ÇØË®òÂøµ„ÄÅ‰∏≠‰∏ñ„ÅÆ„Éë„É≥„Éá„Éü„ÉÉ„ÇØ„Å´ÊÉ≥„ÅÑ„ÇíÈ¶≥„Åõ„Çã‰∏ÄÂìÅ„Åß„Åô„ÄÇ„Éè„É≠„Ç¶„Ç£„É≥„Å´„ÇÇ„Ç™„Çπ„Çπ„É°„Åß„ÅôüíÄ\n\nA beaded plague doctor.

The various rallies were held under banners such as the \u201CNo Marxism in America Rally\u201D and the \u201CTrump 2020 Cruise Rally.\u201D Counter-protesters from anti-fascist groups like Popular Mobilization PDX also gathered Saturday, and the two groups quickly began shouting at each other and engaging in tense, face-to-face confrontations in front of the Multnomah County Justice Center. Within an hour of meeting, protesters began to push each other and throw objects. Some demonstrators on the pro-police side fired paintball guns and deployed pepper spray on counterdemonstrators. Other protesters used baseball bats. Many people wore helmets and body armor as they punched, kicked and tore at each other. Ahead of the weekend rallies, the FBI said it had received a bomb threat against federal buildings in Portland. The agency said it was still assessing the credibility of the threat Friday, and closed federal buildings through the weekend as a precaution.

Wherever restrictions are eased, it erupts stronger than before, infecting younger and younger people, and with strains up to ten times more contagious. As temperatures begin to drop and outdoor entertainment becomes less appealing, people will either avoid going out or attend indoors events and increase the already high risk of contagion. At the same time, those who stay home can expect irritation and low spirits, at best, and temper tantrums are more than likely. And worst of all, domestic violence is bound to soar.\n\nAlso, as jobs run out and scores fall into a cash-flow crisis, food insecurity and disconnection from utilities will become commonplace. In that state, hopelessness coupled with the tense upcoming elections will exacerbate street violence, homicide, looting, and arsons to the point where they become routine. In many towns and neighborhoods, people will not dare set foot outside their homes. Unless something changes fast, we\u2019d better prepare for a very tough winter.\n\nBut if anything can change, it is the future. The future is always in our hands to shape. And now is our last call to shape our society into a community, a congregation of accountable individuals who are responsible for one another and do not let other people fall by the wayside just because they\u2019re not on my political, racial, or ethnic side.\n\nWe are living the final days before the collapse, but we haven\u2019t fallen yet. We can eyeball the hatred in our hearts and tell it, \u201CThe more you grow, the more we the people will unite. It is only thanks to you, hatred, that we tighten our bond.\u201D\nIt\u2019s natural for opposites to dislike one another. Love between people of conflicting views always requires hard work. But precisely because of it, it is the only love that you can truly say you chose of your own volition. Only when you rise above your natural inclination can you say that you have made a free choice. But once you\u2019ve made it, it is yours.","NumberOfLikes":77,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Kabbalist Dr. Michael Laitman on August 23, 2020.

If you\u2019re not surrounded by highly sensitive people, you\u2019re going to feel like you\u2019re the only one who\u2019s struggling.

Your boundary is your boundary.

While the woman is not wearing a mask, she does appear to be holding one in her hand.\n\nBefore stepping off the plane, the woman, who appears to be White, turns to the other passengers and says \u201CRacism at its best.\u201D Then, she seemingly notices that someone is filming her (a different person than the one who uploaded the footage to TikTok). The woman then asks why she is being filmed and appears to say, \u201CYou don\u2019t even know what\u2019s going on.\u201D\n\nAt that point, several people on the plane apparently yelled expletives at the woman, to which her daughter tries to defend her.

One of my recent goals has been to give at least twice as much as I get. Every week I go to the @hillcrestfarmersmkt and every week I'm generally dressed the same and covered in paint. Months ago a young lady, whom I now know as Elle and see regularly at the market, commented on my paint covered pants. I noticed she had a sketchbook with her as she was helping work the booth of her family business, Carmel Corn. She showed me some of her sketches and I could feel her passion for being an artist. She told me about some new art supplies she just got and how excited she was to try them. Her work is fantastic and I have no doubt that she has a bright future ahead of her. \n\nI love to do giveaways and I love to do them far more often than I acknowledge because I operate off of feeling and love to surprise people. Random acts of kindness are far more fun and rewarding that scheduled giveaways that are little more than strategic marketing tactics. Today when I walked down to the market I decided to surprise Elle with a gift pack with a bag full of prints, postcards, stickers, and buttons. I also gave her a painting. It was such a cool feeling to make her day...and a reminder that sometimes making the day of someone else can make yours as well.  Living in this pandemic, it's amazing how much more the little things mean and the difference they can make. \n\nYou can check out Elle's work on IG @sleppy.arts \n\nYour support at CariniArts.com allows me more opportunities for random acts of kindness like this.\n\n#art #arts #artist #hillcrest #farmersmarket #artistsoninstagram #artistsofinstagram #instaart #instaartist #sunday #pandemic #goodvibes #smallbusiness #localbusiness #carmelcorn #hope #dreamer #artmentor #artteacher #kindness #cariniarts #acrylicalchemy","NumberOfLikes":106,"Hashtags":["#art","#arts","#artist","#hillcrest","#farmersmarket","#artistsoninstagram","#artistsofinstagram","#instaart","#instaartist","#sunday","#pandemic","#goodvibes","#smallbusiness","#localbusiness","#carmelcorn","#hope","#dreamer","#artmentor","#artteacher","#kindness","#cariniarts","#acrylicalchemy"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Michael Carini | Carini Arts on August 23, 2020 tagging @hillcrestfarmersmkt, and @sleppy.arts.

But lately, I have judged. Several mothers. In the playgrounds, I've observed mothers with reusable face masks, and their babies in disposable nappies. I don't know about you, but that brings a big ????? in my mind. \n.\nI want to ask these mothers: why are you concerned enough about the environment or your wallet or whatever reason you have, to choose a reusable mask over a disposable one (let's not even get started on the topic of all the disposable face masks laying around on the streets....), but make the choice for your baby to use disposable items?\n.\nI know that the step over the line from mainstream disposable nappies to cloth nappies can seem like a huge step. But I assure you, and I am sure all other cloth nappy mom's will as well, that the line is basically just a line your finger drew in the sand. Just step over it. You hardly even have to lift your feet. \n.\nMaybe the reusable face masks so accessible everywhere, and the choice seemed easy for you. But the cloth nappies are not hard to find either, although you don't see it on the front display in clothing shops in all colours and prints: but a simple search online will show you a beautiful universe of colourful and simply just incredible cloth nappies, with all prints you can imagine. Like, how random is it that I have found a face mask that matches one of the nappies my baby has? I've learned something in the rabbit hole of cloth nappies: name something you would like to see as a print on a nappy, and it does exist. \n.\nFun fact: I've even seen a special ordered cloth nappy with the text: \"Daddy, will you marry mommy?\" \n.\nI hope and believe that this time were facing behind a mask will lead on to a more natural way of seeing cloth nappies for families that never even would give it a second thought before.\n.\n#covid19 #facemask #pandemic #motherhood #clothdiapers #clothnappyaddict #newnormal2020 #newnormal #clothnappies #verano2020 #pa√±alesdetelaespa√±a #pa√±alesreutilizables #pa√±alesdetela #pa√±alesecol√≥gicos #makeclothmainstream","NumberOfLikes":7,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#facemask","#pandemic","#motherhood","#clothdiapers","#clothnappyaddict","#newnormal2020","#newnormal","#clothnappies","#verano2020","#pa√±alesdetelaespa√±a","#pa√±alesreutilizables","#pa√±alesdetela","#pa√±alesecol√≥gicos","#makeclothmainstream"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Ecoteca de beb√© on August 23, 2020.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598209548,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 21:05:48 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Kids Size Masksüë∂üèºüçº\n\nLight weight Face Masks \u203CÔ∏èAvailable In Store and Online Only $5 üî•\nPerfectimellc.com \u203CÔ∏èor 13542 N Florida Ave Suite 114c, Tampa üåø\n\n#facemasks #facemask #covid #mask #masks #coronavirus #skincare #staysafe #facemaskselfie #skincareroutine #handmade #facemasktime #n #beauty #quarantine #socialdistancing #stayhome #corona #facemaskmurah #selfcare #pandemic #skin #skincareproducts #facemaskorganic #fashion #facemasksheet #tampa#floridamask#clearwater#tampafashion","NumberOfLikes":22,"Hashtags":["#facemasks","#facemask","#covid","#mask","#masks","#coronavirus","#skincare","#staysafe","#facemaskselfie","#skincareroutine","#handmade","#facemasktime","#n","#beauty","#quarantine","#socialdistancing","#stayhome","#corona","#facemaskmurah","#selfcare","#pandemic","#skin","#skincareproducts","#facemaskorganic","#fashion","#facemasksheet","#tamp","#floridamas","#clearwate","#tampafashion"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Perfectime llc in Tampa, Florida.

E √© isso que vai fazer a diferen√ßa nas nossas finan√ßas pessoais.\n\nUm primeiro passo para manter a economia alcan√ßada √© se questionar: dentre tantas coisas, itens de consumo, ou mesmo despesas fixas, que voc√™ abriu m√£o nesse per√≠odo, de quais deles voc√™ mais sente falta?

I'm already halfway to goal! Every amount counts and is appreciated; though, here's a sweet deal: \n\nIf you want a brand-new, never-even out of the box folding treadmill, here's your opportunity. We're too lazy to unpackage the dang thing, plus using a treadmill on the fifth floor in an apartment building isn't a way to win friends and influence people (even if those downstairs neighbors puff stink weed and let their dogs whine all day). The treadmill's retail value is $430 and won't be available for delivery from Amazon at least until September 2. Be the first to donate $175+ to my #TeamforKids #fundraiser and the thing is yours as soon as you can get it from my #BayRidge apartment with pickup and transport on you. (Note: our elevator is out.) Donate $250 or more and I\u2019ll kick in a TaskRabbit to help you move the thing (within five boroughs + Jersey City). Donate any amount and you have the gratitude of yours truly, as well as that of some 250,000 fit kids. \n\nDonation link: https:\/\/bit.ly\/3jbAuVH (Also in bio.) \n\nAlso, thanks to all who donated to my #SpecialOlympicsChicago campaign. Thanks to you, I hit my goal for 2020! Since the #2020ChicagoMarathon has been cancelled, that fundraiser will pick up in 2021 or 2022; details to follow at that time. #fundraisers #fundracer #running #cheaptreadmill #getinshape #taxdeductions #charity #charitymiles","NumberOfLikes":7,"Hashtags":["#treadmill","#Running","#walking","#pandemic,","#VirtualNewYorkMarathon","#youthfitness","#DriFit","#prorunner-led","#TeamforKids","#fundraiser","#BayRidge","#SpecialOlympicsChicago","#2020ChicagoMarathon","#fundraisers","#fundracer","#running","#cheaptreadmill","#getinshape","#taxdeductions","#charity","#charitymiles"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Anne Szustek Talbot in Bay Ridge.

Luego camin√© por una bajada de concreto donde hab√≠a un muchacho de aspecto agradable a mis ojos. ¬øQue piensas hacer en ese momento para llamar su atenci√≥n? Pues claro, sonre√≠rle.

Blocking the middle seat is such a huge plus, not only does it give you more room, but it truthfully mitigates the risk of COVID-19.  Additionally , the cabin crew ensured everyone was properly wearing a mask , and those that had masks with exhalation valves got surgical masks to cover them.  I'd put the actual flight as the lowest risk of the whole experience.  Not only is the cabin air refreshed with filtered air every few minutes , but everyone had their masks on.  The airport gate however is where I believe the highest risk of transmission is.  While 80% were wearing masks properly, 20% seemed to forget that the nose is part of their respiratory system. However both Newark and Florida had EXTREMLY high levels of mask wearing.  I actually didn't see a single person without a mask.  All in all despite prevalence being much higher now than when I flew back in March, the added safety measures definitely mitigate the spread.

What are the regulations or limitations in this new world?) our workshop is fully customized for the family and - while no one has all of the answers these days - we'd be working with as a team, advocating for them applicable, and will always be out front of the required information so that families stay in the know.\n\nThis workshop is four weeks long (one class per week, at time\/date of your choosing, with follow-up), instructor-led via live-stream (or phone call), and open-enrollment. We do not want to add strain in an already stressful time \u2013 we want to do the opposite \u2013 encouraging students and families to be confident in their next steps.\n\nThese seminars are individualized and customized so that you and your student can get as much value out of them as possible. The sessions focus on the particular needs, capacities, and interests of your student in order to answer questions, set a plan, and lower stress (all while preparing them for what comes next, even if it may be seemingly unknown at this time). It's our way of helping in any way that we can.\n\nIf this interests you and your family, let us know by sending a DM or an email to info@leonardandrew.com!\n\n#Tutor #tutoring  #focus  #admissions #studentathletes #athletes #college #collegeprep #studentathlete #athlete  #collegeadmissions #ncaa #learning #guidance #help #motivation #inspiration #morningmotivation  #workshops  #workshop  #showcase #pandemic #pandemiclife #covid19  #hereforyou  #collegelife #collegesports #educationalconsultant #educational #educationalconsulting","NumberOfLikes":8,"Hashtags":["#Tutor","#tutoring","#focus","#admissions","#studentathletes","#athletes","#college","#collegeprep","#studentathlete","#athlete","#collegeadmissions","#ncaa","#learning","#guidance","#help","#motivation","#inspiration","#morningmotivation","#workshops","#workshop","#showcase","#pandemic","#pandemiclife","#covid19","#hereforyou","#collegelife","#collegesports","#educationalconsultant","#educational","#educationalconsulting"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by LeonardAndrewED in Branford, Connecticut.

Businesses with physical stores mandatorily shut down their physical locations which led to significant layoffs.

Especially if you have the means to listen, because most of the time that\u2019s all someone has ever needed, time and patience.\n.\nIf someone reaches out, stop for a second and listen, we may not fully understand their path or what they may be feeling, but somethings happening, they aren\u2019t \u201Ccrying for no reason\u201D, they are #sensitive and feeling. They have thoughts manifesting they may not understand how to deal with or may be struggling with self acceptance in some way and need an uplifting presence.\n.\nEveryone has something going on and that\u2019s ok, so during times like these #MentalHealth means celebrating our differences because a slight trip can feel life threatening to some, even if it is not. It could push someone over the edge if they haven\u2019t the means to talk or self express, because this is the one way we all know how to vent. \n.\nAt times anxiety can feel like something is wrapping its claws around you and you are struggling to free yourself from feeling that pain. When in truth that might just be the hug needed to move you through stormy days. That feeling may become uncomfortable to some when they aren\u2019t used to feeling loved unconditionally or mentally strong.\n.\nI hope you can understand when you see someone crying, hurt or upset that it\u2019s not because they are bad people or dealing negativity, most of the time it\u2019s more about #selfacceptance and they just can\u2019t seem to grasp the idea of loving themselves.

Pandang wajahnya saat dia tidur, ucapkan....\"Ibu mau (nama anak) jadi anak yang sholeh, sayang...\"\nCoba amalkan (seperti kata Ustadz, kata-kata ini bermakna kita bercakap dengan rohnya) \ndan ucapan ini adalah DOA, sesungguhnya Allah Maha Mendengar lagi Maha Melihat.\n\n3. Bangun shalat malam, shalat lah disisinya. Maksudnya kita shalat dalam kamar dia dan dekat dengan ananda. Jika Kita sering melakukannya dan kita juga selalu beritahu dia bahwa kita sering doakan dia, dia akan merasakan satu  ikatan kasih sayang yang hakiki yang kita sangat sayang pada dia dan mau dia jadi anak yang sholeh. Dia akan tahu kita selalu shalat hajat untuknya.\n\n4. Minta dikasihani. Ucapkan setiap saat bahwa kita ini sedang menunggu panggilan Allah. Jika dia tidak jadi anak sholeh bermakna dia tidak sayang kita dan tentunya kita akan merana di Alam Barzah nanti.\n\n5. Peluklah anak selalu walaupun dia sudah besar, sebagaimana kita sayang dia saat kecilnya. Aura ciuman dan belaian Ibu sambil bisikkan padanya bahwa kita bangga mempunyai anak sepertinya.\n\n6. Maafkan anak kita setiap waktu walaupun perbuatannya amat melukai hati kita. Muhasabah diri, mungkin kesalahan yang anak kita lakukan itu adalah karena dosa-dosa kita di masa lalu.\n\n7. Yang paling penting jaga tutur kata kita, jangan sekali-kali ucapkan perkataan yang bisa melukai hatinya. Jika ini terjadi juga karena kita khilaf, cepat-cepat cari waktu yang sesuai untuk kita minta maaf padanya.

Di sepanjang jalan, dia sering melihat orang-orang makan daging. Dia pun merasa sedih karena jarang sekali bisa makan daging. Dia pulang ke rumahnya dengan hati jengkel.\n\nSesampai di rumah, istrinya menyuguhkan kedelai rebus. Dengan hati terpaksa, dia memakan kedelai itu seraya membuang kupasan kulitnya ke luar jendela. Dia sangat bosan dengan kedelai.\n\nDia berkata pada istrinya :\n\u201CBagaimana hidup kita ini...? Orang-orang makan daging, kita masih makan kedelai.\"\n\nTidak lama kemudian, dia keluar ke jalan di pinggir rumahnya. Alangkah terkejutnya, dia melihat seorang lelaki tua duduk di bawah jendela rumahnya, sambil memungut kulit-kulit kedelai yang tadi ia buang dan memakannya seraya bergumam :\n\n\"Segala Puji bagi Allah Subhanahu wata'ala yang telah memberiku rezeki tanpa harus mengeluarkan tenaga.\"\n\nMendengar ucapan lelaki tua itu, dia menitikkan air mata, seraya bergumam :\n\n\"Sejak detik ini, aku rela dengan apapun yang Engkau berikan yaa Allah...\"\n\nRezeki itu yang penting mengalir, besar kecil yang penting ada alirannya. Jangan berharap mengalir seperti banjir, karena jikalau kita tidak bisa berenang maka bisa tenggelam.\n\n\"Sampai kapan kita sibuk dengan kelezatan, sedangkan kita akan ditanya tentang semua yang kita lakukan.\"\n\nBerkata Ali bin Abi Thalib radhiyallahu 'anhu :\n\n\u201CBarang siapa perhatiannya hanya pada apa yang masuk ke dalam perutnya, maka nilai seseorang tidak lebih dari apa yang keluar dari perutnya.\"\n\nMungkin dulu kita pikir, rezeki itu berwujud uang, banyak job, urusan kerjaan lancar, banyak tabungan, punya banyak asset disana-sini. \nIntinya : harta.\n\nSetelah mencari tahu apa makna rezeki dalam Islam (sesuai yang tertera dalam Al-Qur'an dan hadits), ternyata kita salah besar.\n\nTernyata...\nüåºLangkah kaki yang dimudahkan untuk hadir ke majelis ilmu, itu adalah rezeki.
