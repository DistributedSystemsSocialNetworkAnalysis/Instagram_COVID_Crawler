In a country doubly ravished by war & disease, Nurse Julia Power works at an understaffed hospital in the city centre, where expectant mothers who have come down with an unfamiliar flu are quarantined together. Into Julia\u2019s stressful world step two outsiders : Doctor Kathleen Lynn, on the run from the police , and a young volunteer helper Bridie Sweeney .\nIn the darkness and intensity of this tiny ward , over the course of three days these women change each others lives in unexpected ways . They lose patients to this baffling pandemic , but they also Shepard new life into a fearful world . With tireless , tenderness and humanity , carers & mothers alike somehow do their impossible work . \n\nReview ~ \nThis book from the beginning was startling . The similarities between the 1918 & 2020 pandemic are each as devasting as each other .. a deadly flu that is being spread by love , touch & kindness . \nWe follow nurse Julia over three exhausting days in a maternity ward that fits no more than a few beds in where she works tirelessly to save these mothers and their newborns . I felt raw with emotion for these mothers giving birth in a terrifying era where even to have privacy is denied . Although the mothers did not know each other there was real compassion between them . \nThis is a brilliantly written book , it is evident how much research Emma has done , the detail in the midwifery parts are at times hard to read at the same time utterly astonishing that this was a reality . \nI loved this book , the characters in it are so vivid , such ordinary daily acts that are quite extraordinary . \nA story that will stay with me long after the last page ‚ôàÔ∏è#emmadonoghue #bookstagram #pandemic #booklover #bookworm #books #reading #reviews","NumberOfLikes":26,"Hashtags":["#emmadonoghue","#bookstagram","#pandemic","#booklover","#bookworm","#books","#reading","#reviews"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The Aries Bookshelf ‚ôàÔ∏è‚ú® on August 23, 2020.","NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1598193569,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 16:39:29 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Light weight Face Masks Available In Store and Online Only $5 \nPerfectimellc.com or 13542 N Florida Ave Suite 114c, Tampa üåø\n\n#facemasks #facemask #covid #mask #masks #coronavirus #skincare #staysafe #facemaskselfie #skincareroutine #handmade #facemasktime #n #beauty #quarantine #socialdistancing #stayhome #corona #facemaskmurah #selfcare #pandemic #skin #skincareproducts #facemaskorganic #fashion #facemasksheet #tampa#floridamask#clearwater#tampafashion","NumberOfLikes":23,"Hashtags":["#facemasks","#facemask","#covid","#mask","#masks","#coronavirus","#skincare","#staysafe","#facemaskselfie","#skincareroutine","#handmade","#facemasktime","#n","#beauty","#quarantine","#socialdistancing","#stayhome","#corona","#facemaskmurah","#selfcare","#pandemic","#skin","#skincareproducts","#facemaskorganic","#fashion","#facemasksheet","#tamp","#floridamas","#clearwate","#tampafashion"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Perfectime llc in Tampa, Florida.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598193545,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 16:39:05 CEST 2020","Location":"Tampa, Florida"},{"CaptionText":"Masked on Mackinac Island, Michigan!\n. \n.\n.\n.\n.\n#streetphotography #bnwstreetphotography #bnwstreet #monochrome #peoplewatching  #lifeisstreet #whatisee #scenesfrommylife #storyofthestreet #street_storytelling #streetstories #streetclassics #hcsc_street #candidcamera #streetstories #capturemoments #peopleonthestreet #capturestreets #wearethestreet #streetphotographs #streetview\n\n#covid #covid19 #pandemic #pandemic2030 #lockdown #coronavirus #coping #mackinacisland #michigan #puremichigan","NumberOfLikes":75,"Hashtags":["#streetphotography","#bnwstreetphotography","#bnwstreet","#monochrome","#peoplewatching","#lifeisstreet","#whatisee","#scenesfrommylife","#storyofthestreet","#street_storytelling","#streetstories","#streetclassics","#hcsc_street","#candidcamera","#streetstories","#capturemoments","#peopleonthestreet","#capturestreets","#wearethestreet","#streetphotographs","#streetview","#covid","#covid19","#pandemic","#pandemic2030","#lockdown","#coronavirus","#coping","#mackinacisland","#michigan","#puremichigan"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ·îïT·ñáEET ·ë≠·ïºOTO·îï ·íçI·í™·í™ ·óØE·í™·í™I·ëéGTO·ëé on August 23, 2020.

Every stakeholder has a legitimate set of concerns, especially watching the reports of school districts that have tried and failed to re-open.\u2060\n\u2060\nRead more on the Pattern Blog: #LinkInBio\u2060\nhttps:\/\/www.pattern-for-progress.org\/the-reopening-of-schools-part-one\/","NumberOfLikes":4,"Hashtags":["#LinkInBio\u2060"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Pattern for Progress on August 23, 2020.","NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598191285,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 16:01:25 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"The number of new COVID-19 infections continues to rise daily in Ukraine.

The movie felt extremely real. I liked how it was a shot, through zoom, but it could have been better. I really thought it was unique that the film was shot in real time. This a definitely a movie you would want to watch during quarantine, being this film takes place during the Coronavirus pandemic. They make a few references to the current pandemic. This film had many scenes that will make you jump. I thought these scenes were executed phenomenally. One scene that I thought was great was when the filter face was floating in mid air, and the girl reached for the face and it turned to face her. This demon was as scary as any demon that we have seen it quite sometime. This film focused more on scaring the life out of you than anything else. The characters lacked substance but that wasn\u2019t the point of this film. The final scene, although predictable, has the ability to make you jump 12 feet in the air. Again, this film has many scenes that are capable of scaring just about anybody. Host got right to the point, wasting no time, finishing with a terrifying 7.6.\n\n#horrormovies #horror #scary #demon #demonic #host #zoom #coronavirus #pandemic #quarantine #horrornews #movienight #moviescenes #dark #moviereview #rating #newmovies #currerntevents #ghost #shudder","NumberOfLikes":23,"Hashtags":["#horrormovies","#horror","#scary","#demon","#demonic","#host","#zoom","#coronavirus","#pandemic","#quarantine","#horrornews","#movienight","#moviescenes","#dark","#moviereview","#rating","#newmovies","#currerntevents","#ghost","#shudder"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Horror Crazed in New Orleans, Louisiana with @haley_bishop.

It can also infect humans and is known as Weil's disease. \n\nDon't believe the scare stories- if you have concerns regarding vaccinating your pet please speak to your vet who will be happy to discuss this with you... don't rely on Facebook groups or Instagram accounts that are spreading false rumours!\n\nThere are those who want to see a world with no vaccines. Well, this coronavirus pandemic has shown us what the world is like without just one specific vaccine. \n\nPlease share to spread the world - vaccines work!\n\n#vaccines #vaccineswork #science #medicine #epidemiology #scicomm #pandemic #covid19 #pets #animals #dogs #dogstagram #ilovemydog #cats #horses #veterinary #vetlife #vetmed #stbernard #health #healthylifestyle #natural #animalphotography #thatface #farming #veterinarian #puppy #fakenews  #naturalhealth","NumberOfLikes":61,"Hashtags":["#Repost","#vaccines","#vaccineswork","#science","#medicine","#epidemiology","#scicomm","#pandemic","#covid19","#pets","#animals","#dogs","#dogstagram","#ilovemydog","#cats","#horses","#veterinary","#vetlife","#vetmed","#stbernard","#health","#healthylifestyle","#natural","#animalphotography","#thatface","#farming","#veterinarian","#puppy","#fakenews","#naturalhealth"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Vetlife on August 23, 2020.

The intelligence contains indisputable evidence of the local cover-up attempt, the officials say.\n\nThe reports also say that when the Chinese Communist Party learned about the virus, it sought to obscure the full extent of that knowledge from the rest of the world. They also believe that there came a point where China President Xi Jinping did become aware of the full extent of the outbreak in Wuhan and realised that coronavirus was spreading but continued to downplay the situation publically.\n\nThese findings are on the lines of the Trump administration's repeated accusations against China. The Trump administration has for long looked into the possibility that the novel coronavirus spread from a Chinese laboratory rather than a market, but has presented no proof to back up that theory. \n\nFor more news updates, stay tuned with Socialist-Today.\n\n#covid19 #covid_19 #coronavirus #news #newsupdates #china #wuhan #wuhanchina #pandemic #pandemic2020 #beijing #asia #global #globalpandemic #globalpandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":20,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#covid_19","#coronavirus","#news","#newsupdates","#china","#wuhan","#wuhanchina","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#beijing","#asia","#global","#globalpandemic","#globalpandemic2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Socialist Today on August 23, 2020.

As a matter of fact, the content is now at Irma Boom\u2019s @irma_boom_amsterdam  office to be designed. We took the strange limbo-working from home time to reflect on the Defaults in architecture or maybe the Defaults in society at large. The aftermath of the pandemic will throw us in another long global transition, and architects cannot afford to waste time feeding golden calves. Before we operate, this time we must change the default settings.\n\nHow much of us is by default, and how much is by design?\n\nWe are again very grateful to our great network of friends who immediately helped to think with us and share their insights, hunches and knowledge. Further to our subscribers who stay with us and remain patient. That will be rewarded with an extra super special supplement \u2018Herbarium of Interiors\u2019 we made together with @headgeneve.
