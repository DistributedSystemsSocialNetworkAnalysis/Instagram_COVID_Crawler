Just for being you ♥️ We are in such crazy times right now and it\u2019s rare that our entire world is experiencing that same struggle together. I had a moment at the shops yesterday where I kinda stopped and thought, wow, I\u2019m starting to forget what the world looked like pre-Covid, and that was a weird feeling. I remember the day I walked into work and our boss said, \u201Cget all your stuff together it\u2019s time to relocate home indefinitely\u201D. It was a mix of yes how awesome, woah what\u2019s going on, and how long will this last? I remember being so nervous about how to go outside my house while keeping safe but now it\u2019s such second nature. The prospect of 3 months locked down in the beginning was hard to fathom, I thought they were exaggerating. But now we are nearing 6 months and there is no end in sight. This is a time we will never see again, and hopefully the next few generations don\u2019t either. But there are some incredible things that have come out of it. Kindness, empathy, togetherness, community spirit, compassion, support, and love! I look at our Jeep community here on insta, the community I physically live in here at home, and the ones I\u2019m part of at work and socially and I feel so blessed to witness the strengthened bonds we share.

He and his colleagues have been developing a way to render those particles and other infectious agents harmless. The team researches \u201Celectroceutical\u201D materials that wirelessly \u201Cgenerate electric fields across the surface of the fabric,\u201D he says. Those fields can disrupt the behavior of bacteria or viruses on the cloth.\n\nThe researchers co-developed the material with the biotechnology company Vomaris Innovations in 2012. Last year they showed that the technology could be used to treat bacterial biofilms in wounds. A clinical trial is underway to further evaluate the fabric\u2019s effectiveness as a Food and Drug Administration\u2013cleared dressing for wound care.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers team tested its existing material on a different coronavirus strain that causes a respiratory illness in pigs and on an unrelated type of pathogen called a lentivirus. In a study posted on the preprint server ChemRxiv in May, researchers team reported that its electroceutical fabric destabilized both viruses, leaving them unable to infect cells. The researchers plan to submit the results to a peer-reviewed journal as well.\n\nTo study the fabric\u2019s action, they placed a liquid solution containing viral particles onto the electroceutical fabric and a polyester control fabric without the metal dots. After the droplets were fully absorbed, and the samples had rested for one to five minutes, the researchers recovered viral particles from both fabrics and tested whether they could still infect the types of cells they typically target.\n#covid19 #cdc #coronavirus #covid_19 #covid19update #science #biotechnology #biotech #mask #n95 #ppe #pandemic","NumberOfLikes":1,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#cdc","#coronavirus","#covid_19","#covid19update","#science","#biotechnology","#biotech","#mask","#n95","#ppe","#pandemic"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Uzayr Gul in Neverland.

At the time, I was a few months away from travelling and aspired to work remotely. I've known for a long time that I didn't want to settle down in one place just yet. But I didn't know how I'd fund this location independent lifestyle.\n\nAfter a couple online courses and months of research, I decided to begin my journey with a blog and diversify from there.\n\nAt university, I studied zoology, a subject I'm very passionate about. I didn't want to abandon science altogether and desired to combine my education with my love of travel. I wanted to produce a valuable resource for those interested in sustainable travel, remote work & conservation.\n\nI finally launched The Runaway Grad in February of 2020 and, after some rocky months of lockdowns and travel cancellations, I've finally committed to creating content. While, I dreamed of writing my own posts and stories, I had no idea how blogging would feel. After 8 posts and two months of writing, I can tell you that it's so much more rewarding than I anticipated. And that was before anyone started reading.\n\nIt has, however, only been 2 months. That's no time at all, really. But so far, I love this world of blogging. I'm eager to learn more and work harder to produce better content and useful resources for you.\n\nThe coming months will be a challenge and less free than we all hoped, but I'm now on a mission. 2021 will bring great things for all of us. Yes, we'll have to adapt to the new world, but I know we can make next year a better one! 💙","NumberOfLikes":6,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by 🌍The Runaway Grad in County Durham.

But in the age of social media it's difficult to fully escape; even if it's 10 years later.\n\nI guess if you and your ex partner had a reasonably amicable breakup, then it may be normal to recieve the odd check in text.\n\nBut what happens if you had a toxic relationship, and made it clear you are no longer interested?\n\nEven then it may be 'normal' for them to contact you every now and then, to see if they can still wrap you round their little finger (thank goodness for the BLOCK option). \n\nBut we are living in unusual times.

Sorry to tell you but their BEST SALAD is no longer on the menu BUT.. you would be very happy with their Greek Salad or their Taco Salad. \n🍺My all time favorite drink that, up until now, I have found NOWHERE ELSE... is the Tangerine Tornado. 🍊🌪 For kids? Treat them to one of their amazing Root Beer Floats.🤎\nMOST Importantly.. when all of this has passed... stop in the Kankakee location. Sit down, enjoy.

The weather is finally bearable, there's something pleasant about those cooler mornings and evenings, everything starts afresh with the new school year and end of summer, leaves change. I was desperately awaiting October this year, overexcited to go back to work after seven months spent working from home (as opposed to the one month that was announced back in March), ready to take out clothes that don't resemble fitness attire and to finish what was started months ago. But life has a different plan. This is why I, the Type A who always plans everything, gave up on planning a long time ago. Just let things happen. This year has taught us that and more. There's no point in planning; there's no reason to put things off for later (oh the things I was supposed to do this year! Seems funny now), there's reason to be grateful for work, health, and family; there's always next year. As for this year, while I'm still stuck working from home without a proper desk or adequate lighting, I'll take what I can get and will make the most of it.\/\/ One of our spontaneous trips planned at the last minute (instead of our long road trip to Seattle, Oregon, and California 😭 - canceled among many other things) ended at a park in Pennsylvania, where autumn is slowly creeping in. #autumn #reflection #reflecting #pandemic #2020 #leaves #pennsylvania #birkenstock #plans #planning #spontaneous #roadtrip #roadtrips #placetobe #outdoorsy #beauty #wilderness #wildernessculture #nature #naturelover #outdoors #wanderer #wanderlust #womenwhoexplore #living #liveoutdoors #optoutside #stayandwander #gooutside #travelphotography","NumberOfLikes":6,"Hashtags":["#autumn","#reflection","#reflecting","#pandemic","#2020","#leaves","#pennsylvania","#birkenstock","#plans","#planning","#spontaneous","#roadtrip","#roadtrips","#placetobe","#outdoorsy","#beauty","#wilderness","#wildernessculture","#nature","#naturelover","#outdoors","#wanderer","#wanderlust","#womenwhoexplore","#living","#liveoutdoors","#optoutside","#stayandwander","#gooutside","#travelphotography"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598642774,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 28 21:26:14 CEST 2020","Location":"Ohiopyle State Park"},{"Owner":"shoppers_hill","CaptionText":"#mask #shopping #fashion\n#stayathome #newnormal #covid #loveyourself #socialdistancing #india #staysafe #coronavirus #stayhome #bollywood #help #corona #instagram #stayhealthy #covid19 #like #viral #lockdown #workfromhome #repost  #quarantine #pandemic #love #likeforlike #instagood #beauty #safetyfirst","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#mask","#shopping","#fashion","#stayathome","#newnormal","#covid","#loveyourself","#socialdistancing","#india","#staysafe","#coronavirus","#stayhome","#bollywood","#help","#corona","#instagram","#stayhealthy","#covid19","#like","#viral","#lockdown","#workfromhome","#repost","#quarantine","#pandemic","#love","#likeforlike","#instagood","#beauty","#safetyfirst"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598642772,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 28 21:26:12 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"plasma_bubble","CaptionText":"The #pandemic + #revolution has not affected me one bit!","NumberOfLikes":10,"Hashtags":["#pandemic","#revolution"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Alex Hall in Brooklyn, New York.

The proposal had already won state and federal approval.\n\n\"With all the urgent crises facing our nation and the State of Florida \u2014 the #Covid-19 #pandemic, #racialinjustice, #climatechange \u2014 the #administration has used #taxdollars and #government resources for a #JurassicPark #experiment,\" said Jaydee Hanson, policy director for the International Center for Technology Assessment and Center for Food Safety, in a statement released on August 19. \"Now the #MonroeCounty Mosquito Control District has given the final permission needed. What could possibly go wrong? We don't know, because #EPA unlawfully refused to seriously analyze environmental #risks, now without further review of the risks, the experiment can proceed,\" she added.\n\nApproved by the Environment Protection Agency in May, the pilot project is designed to test if a genetically modified mosquito is a viable alternative to spraying #insecticides to control the #AedesAegypti. It's a species of mosquito that carries several deadly #diseases, such as #Zika, #dengue, #chikungunya and #yellowfever.\n\nThe mosquito, named #OX5034, has been altered to produce female offspring that die in the larval stage, well before hatching and growing large enough to bite and spread disease. Only the female mosquito bites for blood, which she needs to mature her eggs. Males feed only on nectar, and are thus not a carrier for disease.\n\nThe mosquito also won federal approval to be released into #HarrisCounty, #Texas, beginning in 2021, according to Oxitec, the US-owned, British-based company that developed the genetically modified organism (GMO).\nHowever, state and local approval for the Texas release has not been granted, said Sam Bissett, a communication specialist with Harris County Public Health.\n(CNN)","NumberOfLikes":1,"Hashtags":["#genetically","#modified","#mosquitoes","#FloridaKeys","#objection","#residents","#advocacy","#groups.","#Covid-19","#pandemic,","#racialinjustice,","#climatechange","#administration","#taxdollars","#government","#JurassicPark","#experiment,\"","#MonroeCounty","#EPA","#risks,","#insecticides","#AedesAegypti.","#diseases,","#Zika,","#dengue,","#chikungunya","#yellowfever.","#OX5034,","#HarrisCounty,","#Texas,"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by NEWS The Headliner on August 28, 2020.

More than 20% of the children in a recently published COVID 19 study showed eye symptoms.👁\n\nTo elaborate, \u201CA new study out of Wuhan, China, where the novel coronavirus was first detected last year, indicates that some children infected with COVID-19 may show eye symptoms.\n\nIn recent weeks, pediatric coronavirus cases have increased across the country. While most children do not experience serious health consequences, the coronavirus is also linked to multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a rare but serious condition that tends to appear several weeks after a child recovers from COVID-19.The recent study, which was published in the medical journal JAMA Ophthalmology on August 26, examined 216 children between the ages of 2 and 11 years old. All children had tested positive for COVID-19, and while many symptomatic patients had common coronavirus symptoms like fevers and coughs, 49 (22.7%) of the children studied showed \u2018various ocular manifestations.\u2019\u201D \n\nResearcher Kerry Breen has shared with us this information and we would just like to do our part in sharing it with our community.

Our Critical Care physician\/scholars have compelling data that shows a mortality rate of 5.2% in our MATH+ hospitals...compared with an average of 22% in non-MATH+ hospitals. Still, when we presented our peer-reviewed paper (posted here yesterday) to a U.S. television network producer covering the COVID19 pandemic, her response (verbatim) was this:\n\n\"I am sorry but we have so many, many studies to go through every day. I cannot report on this unless there is solid data reviewed by other experts \u2013 which means peer review \u2013 demonstrating improved outcomes. I am sure your team believes this protocol works. But they have to show that it does.\"\n\nAgain, our physicians will NOT conduct an RCT and randomize to placebo any patient needing MATH+ in order to survive... just so we can have our protocol headlining the evening news. This means that though we will sustain our efforts to urge physicians around the globe to implement MATH+ for critically ill COVID19 patients, we are under no illusion that this plea will be amplified by mainstream media. We need to do this ourselves, in partnership with all of YOU.\n\nThe Helsinki Declaration of the World Medical Association stipulates, in part, that \u201CThe health of my patient will be my first consideration,\u201D and the International Code of Medical Ethics declares that, \u201CA physician shall act in the patient\u2019s best interest when providing medical care.\u201D\n\nOur team pledges to uphold the Helsinki Declaration and provide care firmly grounded in these ethical principles\u2014ALWAYS.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.tabletmag.com\/sections\/science\/articles\/randomized-control-tests-doidge","NumberOfLikes":6,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Frontline COVID-19 on August 28, 2020.

Over the last six months, many have applied their energies and imaginations to various virtual initiatives that, in no uncertain terms, pave the way to what could become standard across the #performingarts - equally-weighted live and #virtual programming running side by side. The @santafeopera\u2019s General Director Robert K. Meya said as much in a recent Associated Press article, highlighting the company\u2019s well-received #SongsfromSantaFe virtual opening nights. \n\nTwo singers who\u2019ve taken up this digital \/ virtual challenge are soprano #EmilyMisch and bass #WillMeinert. Based in Herndon, Virginia, Emily was set to be a @glimmerglassfestival young artist this summer, while Will was scheduled for his second season as a #SantaFeOpera apprentice artist. As their summers and lives changed, they began executing an ambitious plan. The results thus far are impressive; as of this writing, the @PareaSeries format appears to be the only one of its kind online. Viewers are treated to wonderful, longer form #recitals with expert guest conversation around a given topic. Parea\u2019s shorter form Instagram promotional videos also deliver maximum interest - and punch - at around three minutes.

Bring your ID +\/- a piece of mail with your new address if you are moving (some states require you to be a state resident).\n2. Wear your mask and bring sanitizer. There are some items being touched by hundreds of people like the pens, clipboards so you can consider gloves for that. \n3. Want a face shield? Check out @filausa and their new visor shields. Who said you cant be stylish?\n4. Take a picture of your requisition with your phone. When you call asking for results they may ask for these numbers and you may lose the paper. \n5. Keep your mouth covered while testing (just move mask down).\n6. For the actual test, it will be uncomfortable. The deeper it goes and the longer it stays in your nose the more effective the test and the lower the false negative rate. It should be an unpleasant experience but here are my tips for getting through it- find something to hold on to (not the nice testing staff) like your phone or your leg. Tilt your head back and try your best to relax your nostrils. If your nose and throat are tense it hurts so much more. The swab will touch the back of your upper throat and cause you to cough but just breathe through it. The more you tense, the longer it takes. \n7. Congratulations! You took your test. Now reward yourself with ice cream or something similar.\n#pandemic #health #healthcare #coronavirus #covid19 #covidtest #medicine #doctor #surgeon #doctorsofinstagram #healthyliving #healthylifestyle #covidkindness #mask #maskon #maskup #florida #floridalife #healthiswealth","NumberOfLikes":49,"Hashtags":["#COVID","#pandemic","#health","#healthcare","#coronavirus","#covid19","#covidtest","#medicine","#doctor","#surgeon","#doctorsofinstagram","#healthyliving","#healthylifestyle","#covidkindness","#mask","#maskon","#maskup","#florida","#floridalife","#healthiswealth"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Kristin Rojas, M.D. in Tallahassee, Florida with @who, @unicef, @cdcgov, @fda, and @floridahealthdepartment.

Contrast the feelings of counting down to a vacation or a Friday night party for example, versus waiting for your delayed package from Amazon or a meal at your favorite restaurant.\n\nMany researchers believe that experiences tend to make people happier, more excited and pleasant because they are less likely to measure the value of their experiences by comparing them to those of others. We compare our new car or iPhone to our peers and the degree of happiness seems dependent on how our \u2018thing\u2019 stacks up to theirs\u2019, but when you go on a vacation, for example, that comparison seems to fade.\n\nThirdly, buying a thing is a solo transaction but experiences are shared. As social creatures, we tend to enjoy moments shared more than purchases made for individual gain.\n\nFinally, we adjust to new things rather quickly (hedonic adaptation) but the happiness over a novel vacation can be relived and conjure up the happiness spark again and again. It also is interesting how people don\u2019t like hearing about others' possessions that much, but do get a kick out of hearing about your recent trip to Costa Rica.   \n\n#happiness #wellness #lifegoals #personalgrowth #successhabits #livethelifeyoulove #summerfun #summerreads #summer2020 #goals  #experiences #adventure #fridayfeeling \n#personaldevelopment #anxiety #anxietyawareness #pandemic #selfcare #wellness #happy #quotestoliveby #signalhill #stjohns #newfoundlandtrails","NumberOfLikes":13,"Hashtags":["#happiness","#wellness","#lifegoals","#personalgrowth","#successhabits","#livethelifeyoulove","#summerfun","#summerreads","#summer2020","#goals","#experiences","#adventure","#fridayfeeling","#personaldevelopment","#anxiety","#anxietyawareness","#pandemic","#selfcare","#wellness","#happy","#quotestoliveby","#signalhill","#stjohns","#newfoundlandtrails"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by William Nippard on August 28, 2020.

I'd like to change the conversation...\u2063\n\u2063\n What have you GAINED this summer?\n\n📸 @dselbak","NumberOfLikes":197,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Sara Lords | Writer on August 28, 2020.

No topo do morro tem as casas mais sólidas, construídas nos anos 70 por emigrantes nordestinos, vindos para São Paulo em busca de fortuna. Descendo em direção ao rio, as casas se tornam barracos, são frágeis, sem saneamento básico.  As casas são muito pequenas e superlotadas, o que dificulta a possibilidade de fazer uma quarentena. Muitas dessas famílias estão sobrevivendo graças a doações e a maioria das crianças estão meses distantes da escola: é difícil fazer aulas online quando a conexão da internet é fraca e quase não há um celular por família.\n\nThe \u201CPeri Alto\u201D favela, in the northern suburbs of São Paulo, reflects the structure of the Brazilian society. At the top of the mountain there are the most solid houses, built in the 70s, when from the northeast of Brazil people emigrated to São Paulo in search of fortune. Going down towards the river, the houses become barracks and the sewers no longer exist. The houses are very small and overcrowded, making it difficult to quarantine. Many of these families are surviving thanks to donations and most children are months away from school: it is difficult to take classes online when the internet connection is weak and there is almost no cell phone per family.\n\nFavela dos Sem-Terra\nPeri Alto\nSão Paulo \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#streetphotographymagazine\n#spicollective\n#coronavirus\n#covıd_19\n#reportagespotlight\n#documentaryphotography\n#everydaybrasil\n#everydaylatinamerica\n#EverydayEverywhere\n#ihatesp\n#myfeatureshoot\n#bbcbrasil\n#myspc\n#quedateencasa\n#bakhishcollective\n#eyeshotmag\n#tdmmag\n#inaltoloco\n#fotografospelademocracia\n#pandemic\n#stayhome\n#covidphotobrazil\n#saopaulo\n#pandemia\n#favela\n#suburban","NumberOfLikes":197,"Hashtags":["#streetphotographymagazine","#spicollective","#coronavirus","#covıd_19","#reportagespotlight","#documentaryphotography","#everydaybrasil","#everydaylatinamerica","#EverydayEverywhere","#ihatesp","#myfeatureshoot","#bbcbrasil","#myspc","#quedateencasa","#bakhishcollective","#eyeshotmag","#tdmmag","#inaltoloco","#fotografospelademocracia","#pandemic","#stayhome","#covidphotobrazil","#saopaulo","#pandemia","#favela","#suburban"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Luca Meola in Jardim Peri Alto with @inaltoloco, and @associacaoresiliencia.

I didn\u2019t get to run into an old friend and compare our class schedule hoping that we had a class or at least a mutual day within the building together. Although there was a lot I didn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t do, there was a lot that I did do...\n\nI got to have a slow morning and take my time for breakfast. I got to spend some time with God.

Harris spent the majority of her first non-nomination-related speech excoriating the Trump administration\u2019s failures in dealing with the covid-19 pandemic \u2014 a prebuttal, of sorts, for whatever Trump says about the issue when he accepts the Republican presidential nomination Thursday night. \u201CThe Republican convention is designed for one purpose: to soothe Donald Trump\u2019s ego.

Ben yeğenimin eline bu oyuncağı güvenle verebiliyorum🥰\n.\n.\nÇocuklar herkesin bildiği gibi çevresindeki şeyleri tanımak için ağıza alınmayacak şeyleri bile ağızlarına alirlar. Eline verdiğimiz 'masum' oyuncaklar belki de bizim tahmin edemeyeceğimiz kadar zarar veriyor onlara. \n.\nPlastik maddelerin ne kadar zararlı olduğu günümüzde daha da önem kazanmaya başladı. Buna dikkat çekilen bir uygulama da plastik poşetlerin yasaklanması 👍(bu örnek  siyasetle ilgili bir atıf değildir yanlış anlaşılma olmasın 😉)\n.\nBu uygulama ilk geldiğinde evet bana da tuhaf geldi ama şöyle oturup düşündüğümüzde gerçekten biz insanlar doğaya o kadar çok zarar veriyoruz ki! Hele ki şu yaşadığımız pandemiden sonra insanlar evlerine çekildiklerinde dünya kendini yenilemeye başladı. Bu boş bir bilgi değil tabiki de bilimsel olarak kanıtlanmış. \n.\nBelki de klişe olacak fakat bir tane plastik poşet toprakta uzun yıllar kalabilmekte. Ben elimden geldiğince plastik kullanmamaya ve de çevremdeki insanların da buna dikkat etmesini sağlamaya çalışıyorum 😉\n.\nBir tek kişiden ne olacak deme!

I ask them questions about how they feel about everything going on right now, like the COVID-19 pandemic, the Black Lives Matter movement, and online learning. The goal of this project is to communicate how students are feeling about the state of our world right now while still maintaining quarantine.\n\n\u201CIn the beginning, it was all very overwhelming because of the fact that, I mean, the pandemic on its own is a lot to take in and adjust to, and with schools closing down, not being able to see people as much, having to stay home a lot. And now, because of more focus on the Black Lives Matter movement, like with George Floyd and his death, which obviously was awful, it\u2019s only added more chaos into the mix of everything else that was already happening. It\u2019s definitely odd not being able to be with people you love as easily. I think that as a result of this people are going to take being able to be together for granted less, which I think will be a positive change. I know that greenhouse gas emissions have definitely decreased since the pandemic started, so, if nothing else it\u2019s had some positive benefits for our environment. I\u2019m looking forward to when this finally ends. I\u2019m hopeful that things are going to get better and that this all resolves soon.\u201D\n\n#portraits #portrait #portraiture #photographylovers #photography #portraitphotography #discoverportrait #featurepalette #photographysouls #makeportraitsnotwar #makeportraitsmag #endlessfaces #hvmansouls #creativephotography #creativeart #thebmorecreatives #pursuitofportraits #portraitmood #creative_portraits #pandemicportrait #pandemic #covid19 #covid_19 #artofportrait #bravoportraits #profile_vision #portrait_ig #portraitshoot #portraitstream","NumberOfLikes":29,"Hashtags":["#pandemicportraits","#portraits","#portrait","#portraiture","#photographylovers","#photography","#portraitphotography","#discoverportrait","#featurepalette","#photographysouls","#makeportraitsnotwar","#makeportraitsmag","#endlessfaces","#hvmansouls","#creativephotography","#creativeart","#thebmorecreatives","#pursuitofportraits","#portraitmood","#creative_portraits","#pandemicportrait","#pandemic","#covid19","#covid_19","#artofportrait","#bravoportraits","#profile_vision","#portrait_ig","#portraitshoot","#portraitstream"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Madeleine Phillips on August 28, 2020 tagging @washingtonpost, and @baltimoresun.

AT THE SAME TIME, EVERYTHING CHANGED, NOTHING REALLY CHANGED, EXCEPT, LIKE MANY OTHERS, I\u2019M FIGHTING AN INVISIBLE WAR IN AN UNPREDICTABLE AND UNEXPECTED WAY.\n\nMAY 2020, AFTER TWO LONG MONTHS OF STRAIT AND SEVERE LOCKDOWN, THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT FINALLY UNLOCK THE COUNTRY, IS THE BEGINNING OF \u2013 PHASE 2 \u2013 THE PHASE DURING WHICH YOU MUST LEARN TO LIVE WITH THE ENEMY, BECAUSE THE VIRUS IS NOT COMPLETELY BEATEN YET. SEEMS TO BE A GRADUAL RETURN TO NORMALITY, A NEW NORMALITY DURING WHICH THE SOCIAL DISTANCE RULES ARE MAINTAINED. IS IT REALLY THE END OF THIS PANDEMIC OR IS IT ONLY THE SUMMER SUN THAT IS THAWING THIS COLD WAR?\n\nANDREAROUNDTHEWORLD.COM\/COLDWAR\n\n#coldwar #thawing #selfisolation #socialdistancing #solitude #isolation #pandemic #wildlife #animals #nature #sea #bythesea #cat #lkitten #dog #wolf #photography #instaphoto #documentaryphotography #colorphotography #icpconcerned #sguardoitaliano #tpghomealone #fisheyelemag #thephotographersgallery #polkamagazine #offtheroad #fase2 #salento #italy","NumberOfLikes":12,"Hashtags":["#coldwar","#thawing","#selfisolation","#socialdistancing","#solitude","#isolation","#pandemic","#wildlife","#animals","#nature","#sea","#bythesea","#cat","#lkitten","#dog","#wolf","#photography","#instaphoto","#documentaryphotography","#colorphotography","#icpconcerned","#sguardoitaliano","#tpghomealone","#fisheyelemag","#thephotographersgallery","#polkamagazine","#offtheroad","#fase2","#salento","#italy"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ANDREA D'AMICO in Italy.
