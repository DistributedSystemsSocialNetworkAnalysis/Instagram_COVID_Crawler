There have been days earlier when more deaths have been reported, but those have mainly been a result of some states clubbing together large number of previously unreported deaths. Never before have more than 1,000 deaths been reported on two consecutive days. And in the last three days, there has been no unusual addition of deaths from previous days.\n\nThe increase in the number of deaths have coincided with¬†a big jump¬†in the number of new infections being detected. More than 75,000 new cases have been discovered in the last two days. Before this, the numbers had remained well below 70,000 for more than three weeks. So, it can be tempting to correlate the rise in cases and increase in deaths as part of the same trend. But that is not the case.\n\nÔøº¬†The increase in daily deaths due to Covid-19 in India\n\nThe people who die are not from the same lot who are found infected on that day. They are usually from groups that are been detected positive two to three weeks earlier. There have been reports of people dying within a day or two of being detected positive, but these are small numbers. In most cases, deaths happen after several days of the person getting infected. But there is no fixed time lag, and therefore, it is difficult to correlate any particular episode of spurt in death count to any corresponding rise in the number of cases","NumberOfLikes":0,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#coronanews","#pandemic","#coronavirus","#indiacorona","#indiacovid19","#staysafe"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by News tidbits on August 28, 2020 tagging @who, and @indianexpress.

Before all of this, errands were easy and always a challenge to see how much I could accomplish.  Now, we seem to break a long morning of errands down into smaller bite sizes, while wearing a mask and dousing our hands in hand sanitizer.  This week, one of our outings was at a local nursery here in #columbusgeorgia called @bloomerscolumbusga . Beckham roamed the greenhouse and gardens and soaked his feet in the pond with the goldfish.

This year is stretching us in ways we couldn't have pictured at New Years when we were setting goals and thinking up resolutions.

I ask them questions about how they feel about everything going on right now, like the COVID-19 pandemic, the Black Lives Matter movement, and online learning. The goal of this project is to communicate how students are feeling about the state of our world right now while still maintaining quarantine.\n\n\u201CIn the beginning, it was all very overwhelming because of the fact that, I mean, the pandemic on its own is a lot to take in and adjust to, and with schools closing down, not being able to see people as much, having to stay home a lot. And now, because of more focus on the Black Lives Matter movement, like with George Floyd and his death, which obviously was awful, it\u2019s only added more chaos into the mix of everything else that was already happening. It\u2019s definitely odd not being able to be with people you love as easily. I think that as a result of this people are going to take being able to be together for granted less, which I think will be a positive change. I know that greenhouse gas emissions have definitely decreased since the pandemic started, so, if nothing else it\u2019s had some positive benefits for our environment. I\u2019m looking forward to when this finally ends.

The summer spike in #COVID_19 has started to ease, and governments soon will need to consider how they might begin to reopen the #economy further. Gov. Gavin Newsom is expected to outline his plans Friday. California\u2019s first effort at reopening was disastrous, with the spring\u2019s worst weekly death counts doubling to nearly 1,000 during the summer. Last week\u2019s total fell to about 900. There already are warning signs about what the fall may bring.\n\nA new surge in the #pandemic is far from a certainty \u2014 but experts said it\u2019s essential that California learn from the mistakes of the last reopening.

He is now on a new treatment that requires IV injections, he said. While there is some improvement, there is no guarantee that it will cure his condition and so he decided to step down after treatment Monday, he said.He said his health problem was under control until earlier this year but was found to have relapsed in June when he had an annual checkup.\nAbe, whose term ends in September 2021, is expected to stay on until a new party leader is elected and formally approved by the parliament.\nAbe became Japan\u2019s youngest prime minister in 2006, at age 52, abruptly ended a year later because of his health.\nAfter his recent hospital visits were reported, top officials from Abe\u2019s Cabinet and the ruling party said he was overworked and badly needed rest.\nShigeru Ishiba, a 63-year-old hawkish former defense minister and Abe\u2019s archrival, is a favorite next leader in media surveys, though he is less popular within the governing party. A low-key former foreign minister, Fumio Kishida, Defense Minister Taro Kono, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, and economic revitalization minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, who is in charge of coronavirus measures, are widely mentioned in Japanese media as potential successors.\n\n#japan tokyo #shinzoabe #health #pandemic #politics","NumberOfLikes":2,"Hashtags":["#japan","#shinzoabe","#health","#pandemic","#politics"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by NewsTerminus in Tokyo, Japan.

They include digitization, innovation, technology, artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and virtual reality.\n\nThe reason is that our world is evolving and we cannot undo it. This also means that the ways we live, work, school, do business and even shop are also evolving. Technology has been a vital part of globalization in the last decade or so, now even more so.\n\nAs our traditional methods break down gradually, into non-existence, technology rises to take its place. More and more, the future becomes tech-intensive. We can ride this new wave out or get thrown out of the game. To stay relevant in work and business, we need to tech-up. This means being aware of the innovations in our fields and also implementing them in our processes. It also means learning to be functional in these new areas.\n\nA challenge? Yes, but you\u2019re up for it. Get prepared. The future is tech.\n\n#tech #futureofwork #innovation #technology #digitization #globalization #pandemic #newnormal #future #ai #ar #vr #thefutureistech #thefutureishere #welcometothefuture #poisenigeria #makinggreatexecutives","NumberOfLikes":13,"Hashtags":["#tech","#futureofwork","#innovation","#technology","#digitization","#globalization","#pandemic","#newnormal","#future","#ai","#ar","#vr","#thefutureistech","#thefutureishere","#welcometothefuture","#poisenigeria","#makinggreatexecutives"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Poise Nigeria in Pinnock Beach Estate, Lekki.

In view of the improving public health situation in Hong Kong, a partial return to face-to-face (f2f) teaching will be adopted since September 22.\n\nüíª From Sept 1 to 21, all courses will be delivered online only. During the period of Sept 22 to Nov 30, all courses with either \u2018f2f\u2019 or \u2018mixed\u2019 as the delivery mode (view under \u2018course attributes\u2019 in SIS) will provide a f2f option. For S1 as a whole, all courses will be available online and no f2f classes on campus will be required. All final exams will take place online.\n\nüìù For some courses involving hands-on engagement, they might have to be taken f2f either in whole or in part. Some exams will be held in-person either because of the special requirements (e.g. professional programmes).\n\nüìå As in Semester 2 earlier this year, students will be provided with a \u2018self-enrol\u2019 function on HKU Moodle to allow courses to be audited during the add\/drop period.\n\nüì∑ In 2020-21, students taking online classes are required to turn on their webcams when the teacher asks them to do so (virtual backgrounds are of course permissible).

Whether you want to update your clients on new industry developments or host online tutorials on how to get the most out of your products and services, more people than ever before are choosing to dial into webinars.‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nHow to choose a topic for your webinar‚†Ä\nIf you choose a topic that doesn\u2019t interest your audience, your webinar is doomed to failure. Do your research and identify a topic that will resonate with your audience. Check out what your competitors are up to \u2013 are they covering an interesting topic that seems to get the attention of customers? Take the time to check out what other firms in other industries are doing too \u2013 you might be able to take a theme or idea and repurpose it in a way that works for your audience. Eventbrite is a great place to see what else is going on in your industry and region.‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nPromote your webinar‚†Ä\nThere is no point creating a webinar if nobody knows about it. Email a link to your customers inviting them to join in. Give them a couple of weeks\u2019 notice and follow up with a reminder a few days before the webinar.‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nIf you want to attract some potential new customers, post an invitation to your upcoming webinar on your company website, LinkedIn page, on Twitter, etc. On the day of the webinar, send a final email reminder an hour beforehand that includes a direct link to attend.‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nPractice, practice, practice ‚†Ä\nPractice makes perfect. Have a few rehearsals in order to ensure you iron out any potential glitches. A good practice session can help you to get your timing right, ensure your technology is working correctly and will also help you to deliver your content in an engaging and effective manner.‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nRead the full blog on our website!‚†Ä\n ‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nHave you started hosting webinars and online networking events?

We have been told colds and flu are bad. They are nasty bacteria, germs, or disease that can be caught. Yet what if I told you that the cold or flu is the detox process not the root cause? Meaning the symptom of coughing, fatigue, temperature etc is simply your immune response. Then what is the cause, what is a cold or flu?\u2063\n\u2063\nThey are both the body's last line of detox defence if the general pathways via the immune system, lysosomes to break down damaged cells, phase 1 \/2 liver detox, liver pathways such as  glucuronidation, sulfation and methylation are unable to help. Hence it is the deep clean of removing the accumulated waste from prolonged detoxification. Think of your dirty kitchen being cleaned with the aforementioned immune and detox systems. Yet if your kitchen got out of hand, you may need to hire an external team of cleaners to help. Our cells become toxic due to chemical exposure, toxic food and thought. \u2063\n\u2063\nThe detox may have gone on for months or years. Nutrition is important as we utilize many nutrients to harness the cleansing process. Colds are seen as more bacterial as ita bacteria that is ridding the body of toxic cells. Our janitors are bacteria, parasites and fungi to name a few. They are the deep clean service. In short, colds are good. Too many and it's a sign you're too toxic. Never getting colds and you're either super clean or your immune system is not working. I like to think we need one or so every year or two. \u2063\n\u2063\nI hope to reshape your view on illness. It's simple, if you have a splinter in your finger and it hurts, or is pussing, do we suppress the pain ? Or should we suppress the puss with antiobiotics? Is the pus and pain the cause or symptom? Or should we just pull out the splinter? That is why naturopaths help raise body temperatures and aim to bring the cold out, not suppress it with medicine.\u2063\n\u2063\nIn my next post we will discuss what happens if you don't have the right balance of inner janitors and or essentially you have wiped out certain bacteria, parasites and fungi.

And did you know that we have the choice to be swayed in the chaos or to stay sturdy during the storm?

The Ministry of Home Affairs told the Court that it has given an exemption for opening educational institutions for the purpose of conducting exams.\nIt was argued by the State Governments that the UGC has only the power to lay down standards or education and cannot issue peremptory directions to universities. Further, it was argued that the UGC can only lay down guidelines, that too after consluting the Universities as per¬†Section 12 of the UGC Act. The States contended that the UGC took the decision without consulting them and without taking account of the local situations.\nOn July 20, more than a dozen students had moved the apex court against this UGC decision.

U.S. air travel has dropped 95% compared to last year and the number of flights scheduled globally is down by 63%. More than 16,000 of the world\u2019s commercial aircraft are grounded. These planes can\u2019t just sit idle, they need routine maintenance and a place to be stored. And when you suddenly have thousands of planes with nowhere to go it becomes a logistical nightmare. Here\u2019s a look at how airlines parks thousands of planes and the outlook for the grounded fleet.\n\nAirports are essential to the economic development of cities, countries, and regions. They directly contribute to economies by providing services to airlines, moving passengers, and transporting cargo. The movement of goods and people also benefits governments, consumers, and industries.\nHowever, the COVID-19 outbreak has hit airports hard\u2014which could stall development in emerging markets.\n\nAs a result, air travel has fallen sharply, which has prompted airlines to cut capacity. Many have been closed by governments to contain the spread of the virus. The result is a sharp fall in revenues. Given the importance of airports to the economic development of cities, countries, and regions, the broader impact of COVID-19 on the global economy is enormous.\n\n#covid19 #aviationgeek #aviationdaily #pandemic #economy #aviation4u #aviationnews #airlines #aviationlovers","NumberOfLikes":6,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#aviationgeek","#aviationdaily","#pandemic","#economy","#aviation4u","#aviationnews","#airlines","#aviationlovers"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598598701,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 28 09:11:41 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"globalnews24.7","CaptionText":"#mumbai #bombay #bmc #maharashtra #covid19 #coronavirus #pandemic \n\nFollow¬†@globalnews24.7\nStay alert Stay Update Stay with Current Affairs\n\n#news¬†#newsupdates¬†#newsalert¬†#newsupdate¬†#india¬†#kerala¬†#tamilnadu¬†#andhrapradesh¬†#telangana¬†#karnataka¬†#goa¬†#maharashtra¬†#madhyapradesh¬†#delhi¬†#westbengal¬†#gujarat¬†#rajasthan¬†#jammukashmir¬†#punjab¬†¬†#uttarpradesh¬†#chhattisgarh¬†#odisha¬†¬†#assam¬†#latestnews","NumberOfLikes":13,"Hashtags":["#mumbai","#bombay","#bmc","#maharashtra","#covid19","#coronavirus","#pandemic","#news","#newsupdates","#newsalert","#newsupdate","#india","#kerala","#tamilnadu","#andhrapradesh","#telangana","#karnataka","#goa","#maharashtra","#madhyapradesh","#delhi","#westbengal","#gujarat","#rajasthan","#jammukashmir","#punjab¬†","#uttarpradesh","#chhattisgarh","#odisha¬†","#assam","#latestnews"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by GlobalNews24.7 on August 28, 2020.

Unlike other diseases, life is always fatal.\" With these provocative words, taken from his book 'The Consciousness of Zeno', our great Italo Svevo invites us to review the paradigm of 'health' and 'disease' that we generally take for granted. According to him, in times of crisis and change, it is not so much the 'healthy' who survives, as the 'sick'. Let us first clarify what this writer meant by these terms, within his panorama of ideas. The 'healthy', in Svevo's eyes, was the person perfectly integrated into the social cog of his time who, at the time of the novel in question, could be embodied by the figure of the perfect productive and pragmatic bourgeois. Translated to our days, the 'healthy' is the person who never asks himself questions and identifies himself pedantically with the attitudes, expectations and above all with the roles of today's society: the ambitious manager, the perfect working mother-diligent worker, the rebel a priori, the model student, the radical-chic and so on.\u201D(from my blog) #health #healthy #pandemic #sarabini #italosvevo #blog #instablogger #myblog #lacoscienzadizeno","NumberOfLikes":48,"Hashtags":["#health","#healthy","#pandemic","#sarabini","#italosvevo","#blog","#instablogger","#myblog","#lacoscienzadizeno"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Sara Bini on August 27, 2020.

Frankl, famous Austrian Psychotherapist.\n\nThis #book is an account of the author's experiences as a #Holocaust survivor. He developed his theory of \"logotherapy\" based on his own experiences in the Nazi concentration camp. The chief idea of the book revolves around finding a #purpose or #meaning (\"logos\" is the Greek word for meaning) in life. He explores the reason behind his #survival despite of the suffering he went through. \n\nWhy this book?\n\nIn the first part of the book, Viktor Frankl's vivid description of the social, emotional and spiritual aspects of being a prisoner in the Nazi concentration camp is not only thought provoking but surprisingly relatable as well. The author has addressed many sensitive issues with utmost care and honesty. He recalls, \"The thought of suicide, was entertained by nearly everyone, if only for a brief time. It was born of the hopelessness of the situation, the constant danger of death looming over us daily and hourly, and the closeness of the deaths suffered by many of the others.\"\n\nIn the second part, he describes the different facets of logotherapy, which is basically an account of his learnings from his own experiences. In simple yet intriguing language he explains how finding a meaning in life can help us overcome any situation no matter how difficult or adverse it is- \"Those who have a 'why' to live, can bear with almost any 'how'.\n\nDuring this #pandemic situation, when most of us are suffering from a sense of #uncertainty, this book can be really helpful. It can motivate the reader finding a purpose in life and work towards a meaningful change. #happyreading üòá\n\n#manssearchformeaning #viktorfrankl #logotherapy #viktorefrankl #psychologyfacts #psychologybooks #bookreader #readbooks #bookreading #bookworm #bookstoread #booksofinstagram #bookrecommendations #bookreview","NumberOfLikes":12,"Hashtags":["#Repost","#bookrecommendations","#book","#Holocaust","#purpose","#meaning","#survival","#pandemic","#uncertainty,","#happyreading","#manssearchformeaning","#viktorfrankl","#logotherapy","#viktorefrankl","#psychologyfacts","#psychologybooks","#bookreader","#readbooks","#bookreading","#bookworm","#bookstoread","#booksofinstagram","#bookrecommendations","#bookreview"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Priyanjali Paul on August 27, 2020 tagging @deepanwita_cp.

What we don't, is the effort needed to grate coconuts. Most online stores (FTH, Big Basket etc.) in Bengaluru have middling supply of grated coconut. Even iD's new grated coconut product is rarely available. \n\nIn came Shrikalpa! We saw a WhatsApp message on our apartment group and ordered 2 KGs (at Rs. 200 per KG). It was so very good! Break and thaw what you need, and keep the rest in freezer.\n\nThe owner\/founder delivers it himself for now. He said that they had steady buyers in the airline and hotel industries, so they didn't even bother with a proper website, attractive pack (see iD's for comparison) or deep delivery network. Now, that has completely dried up and forced them to seek a D2C model which demands customer-facing messages, packs and network!\n\nPS: If you're in Bengaluru and want this, let me know.

In Oxford, this included people sleeping on the streets & those in Floyds Row & the sit up (assessment) service at O\u2019Hanlon House. To date, there have been no confirmed cases of the virus among homeless people in Oxford...\n...Interim housing is a bridge between emergency #lockdown arrangements and more sustainable housing. The acquisition of Canterbury House and extension of the YHA lease mean the council will be able to maintain accommodation for people housed during lockdown as existing agreements with hotels & colleges come to an end this month.\nIt will also allow the council to provide accommodation and support for people who become homeless over the coming months. This will include winter beds that were provided in shared spaces before the #pandemic...\n...A total of 203 people have been housed in hotel & student rooms in Oxford over the past 4 months. Of these, 76 have been supported into more permanent #housing & this includes a number of people who had been sleeping rough on a long term basis...\n...While infection rates among #homeless people in #England have been around 6-8%, the rate in US shelters \u2013 where communal spaces have remained open \u2013 is between 60 and 70%. To date, there have been no confirmed cases of the #virus among homeless people in #Oxford.\u201D\nSource @oxfordcitycouncil \n\u2014\u2014\nVisit our website the-daily-good.com or find us on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, & Sticher to listen to our most recent episodes. \n#thedailygood #thedailygoodpodcast #peterflahiff #podcast #applepodcast #stitcher #spotify #goodnews #dailynews #goodnewsfeed #instagood #newspodcast #positivevibes #positivenews #goodvibes #wonderfulworld #covid19","NumberOfLikes":7,"Hashtags":["#pandemic","#emergencyhousing","#coronavirus.","#lockdown","#pandemic...","#housing","#homeless","#England","#virus","#Oxford.\u201D","#thedailygood","#thedailygoodpodcast","#peterflahiff","#podcast","#applepodcast","#stitcher","#spotify","#goodnews","#dailynews","#goodnewsfeed","#instagood","#newspodcast","#positivevibes","#positivenews","#goodvibes","#wonderfulworld","#covid19"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by The Daily Good on August 27, 2020 tagging @oxfordcitycouncil, and @thedailygoodpodcast.

If we use historical data as an indicator, it can be expected that around 75 per cent of single used masks, as well as any other pandemic-related waste such as disposable gloves, will end up in landfills or floating in our seas! \n\nThe promotion of mask wearing to slow the spread of COVID-19 has led to a dramatic increase in the production of disposable masks, single-use masks are typically made from polypropylene, a plastic that can take hundreds of years to break down. They also shed harmful microplastics into our waterways, which are then consumed by unsuspecting marine life harmfully damaging our ecosystem. \nThe continuous use of disposable mask negatively impacts our earth in several ways.

The track also appeared on the 2001 video game Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3, with British music magazine NME describing it as \"so intrinsically linked to 1990s skate culture\".

Our final semester has evaporated into the internet. \n\nThere may not even be a graduation ceremony \u2014 you know, where the principal tries to make everyone laugh and your bum hurts from sitting down for so long until it\u2019s your time to walk.\n\nThings are weird right now, for all of us. But missing the final months of our college story has got to sting. You have the right to feel uncertain, fearful and anxious. You are allowed to feel like fate has wronged you. \n\nWe\u2019re running away from our peers who we\u2019ve \u201Chated\u201D but now we\u2019re realising the family that was created after these 3 years of college. We\u2019re clutching on to the endless laughter with our friends, late night talks, the so called \u201Cstudy sessions\u201D and every last moment that\u2019s familiar. \n\nBut we are a generation of fighters. We have weathered this storm. We are survivors. \n\nDuring this pandemic, you\u2019ve been using the technology and media to raise your voices and share your ideas. You\u2019ve published books. You\u2019ve coded programs to help the community. You\u2019ve expressed yourselves. You\u2019ve created and shared memes to brighten each other\u2019s day. You\u2019ve accomplished something special. \n\nBe proud of your accomplishments and do not dwell on the disappointment or fear that you might not get to walk across that stage at the end of the year. You will be celebrated. \n\nWe may not be gathering in a large auditorium, but please throw a quarantine-safe celebration for yourself. Eat cake. Toss confetti.

Her 2020 Motto is Patience and Flexibility. Everything will take longer than expected and your Plan A will probably not happen. She shared with us how she handled the hustle and bustle of a millennial on the move.\n\nLauren writes:\n\nWe found out at the beginning of 2020 that we are moving to Washington State from Virginia. Neither of us had ever been to the Pacific Northwest so we planned a trip! I hoped to scout neighborhoods and decide where we\u2019d be living. With the pandemic, nothing like that happened. \n\nOur move date got pushed and we were just on standby for weeks. For someone who likes to control everything...the unknown period was so challenging! \n\nOnce we got a date we had about a month to find a house, plan a trip, rent a truck, and start packing! \n\nLuckily, we were able to make quick decisions and found a home, rented a moving truck, and finalized the drive in a few days! \n\nOnce we started the drive, we limited all interactions with people. We\u2019re traveling across many states and want to ensure we take every precaution regarding COVID-19. \n\nWe wore masks everywhere, enjoyed \u201Ccar picnics\u201D, and choose to explore outdoor (dog-friendly) sights! \n\nIt\u2019s an adventure we will never forget! Any future move has to be easier, right? \n\n#millennial #millennials #millennialsmakingit #inspiringwomen #womensupportingwomen #strongwoman #strongindependentwoman #female #femaleempowerment #inspireothers #behonest #shareyourstory #becandid #justbenice #moving #buyingahouse #crosscountrymove #pandemic #movingduringapandemic #covid19 #thestruggleisreal #doingourbest #married #millennialmarriage","NumberOfLikes":12,"Hashtags":["#millennial","#millennials","#millennialsmakingit","#inspiringwomen","#womensupportingwomen","#strongwoman","#strongindependentwoman","#female","#femaleempowerment","#inspireothers","#behonest","#shareyourstory","#becandid","#justbenice","#moving","#buyingahouse","#crosscountrymove","#pandemic","#movingduringapandemic","#covid19","#thestruggleisreal","#doingourbest","#married","#millennialmarriage"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598581992,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 28 04:33:12 CEST 2020","Location":null}]
