The repercussions could be felt in economies and societies for decades to come\". \n\nAdditionally, massive disparities were observed in terms of regions, with 121 million children coming from Sub-Saharan Africa and 147 million from Sub-Saharan Africa. Rural areas particularly were found to suffer especially due to lack of internet access and other online learning facilities. \n\nThe study involved the usage of globally representative data obtained from 100 countries on the availability and presence and availability of technology which can enable online learning, such as television, radio and internet in households.\n\n#propergaanda #education #UN #unitednations #unicef #illiteracy #coronavirus #pandemic","NumberOfLikes":789,"Hashtags":["#propergaanda","#education","#UN","#unitednations","#unicef","#illiteracy","#coronavirus","#pandemic"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ProperGaanda on August 28, 2020.

Amidst the perpetual din of #constructionworkers mainly #migrants living in make-shift huts, a #coaching centre has been functioning for last 5 years in a road-side shack. \u201CWhen I first started teaching, students didn\u2019t know the basics of #mathematics & #science,\u201D says Panna Lal, 22, a teacher at the centre since 2015. Although students would go to a nearby #governmentschool, most of them failed in ninth grade and dropped out.\n\nSince most families in the village comprise tenant #farmers who work on rented land, children are under pressure to forego studies & join their parents. It is this problem that Lal set out to address. The centre takes a minimal fee of INR 100 per month from kids in lower classes & INR 250 from kids in higher classes.\n\nThe #lockdown of about five months due to ongoing #Covid19pandemic has disrupted regular #studies for students at the centre. \u201CMost of the students have forgotten all that they learnt & many still fear coming to school,\u201D explains Dev Kumar, another teacher.\n\nHowever, due to closure of #schools and the break in studies due to absence of #digitaldevices the number of students coming here has jumped manifold. While before the #pandemic, there were 300 students in two centres, the institute has added five more centres with another 550 students, making it a total of 750 in seven centres.\n\n\u201CMost of them don\u2019t even have an #Aadharcard and get no #government benefits in ration or shelter. They also don\u2019t have any #publichospitals nearby. Their make shift huts have no electricity or portable water,\u201D Kumar adds.\n\nThe land on which the school stands belongs to the #delhidevelopmentauthority. Even though people like Lal & Kumar are trying to #educatethecommunity, lack of any #governmentsupport and absence of #basicutilities like #electricity & water has kept residents of Yamuna Khadar in substandard lives & without hopes.\n@eduminofindia @msisodia.aap\n@cmo.delhi\n\n📸@amankanojia.ak\nText @richanigamm\n\n#covid19andeducation #indianeducationsystem #digitaldivide #delhicovid19","NumberOfLikes":53,"Hashtags":["#NewDelhi\u2019s","#Mayur","#metrostation","#Yamuna","#constructionworkers","#migrants","#coaching","#mathematics","#science,\u201D","#governmentschool,","#farmers","#lockdown","#Covid19pandemic","#studies","#schools","#digitaldevices","#pandemic,","#Aadharcard","#government","#publichospitals","#delhidevelopmentauthority.","#educatethecommunity,","#governmentsupport","#basicutilities","#electricity","#covid19andeducation","#indianeducationsystem","#digitaldivide","#delhicovid19"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598619879,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 28 15:04:39 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"\u201CFor every 5 masks we sell,we donate 1 mask\u201D😇\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nIt is because of your love&support today we are able to help all those who cannot afford a mask during this pandemic.🥰✨\nKeep supporting us in this great cause so that we can continue helping needy people.\n#mask#facemask#coronavirus#pandemic#helpinneed#masking#staysafe#stayhealthy#essentials#newnormal.","NumberOfLikes":30,"Hashtags":["#mas","#facemas","#coronaviru","#pandemi","#helpinnee","#maskin","#staysaf","#stayhealth","#essential","#newnormal."],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1598619866,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 28 15:04:26 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Le test PCR, faites le!

They get their name from the crown-like spikes\u2014coronas\u2014that appear on the viruses under a microscope. Coronaviruses can cause the common cold (which can also be caused by other viruses, such as rhinoviruses), as well as dangerous illnesses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). SARS CoV-2, the coronavirus virus first discovered in December 2019, causes the disease now known as COVID-19.\n\nSARS (Severe acute respiratory syndrome)\n\nA coronavirus, which first infected humans in 2002, that reached epidemic proportions before it was contained\u2014there have been no outbreaks since 2003. SARS causes fever, headache, body aches, a dry cough, hypoxia (oxygen deficiency), and usually pneumonia. SARS and SARS CoV-2 are related genetically, but the diseases they cause are different.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2)\n\nThe new coronavirus that causes COVID-19, which is believed to have started in animals and spread to humans. Animal-to-person spread was suspected after the initial outbreak in December among people who had a link to a large seafood and live animal market in Wuhan, China. While no one knows for sure how SARS-CoV-2 spread from an animal (and what type of animal) to a human, SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus, which means it originated in bats. \n\nCOVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019)\n\nJust as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19. The symptoms of COVID-19 include cough, fever, and shortness of breath. While the disease appears to cause mild to moderate illness in most people, in others it has caused life-threatening pneumonia and death. Doctors and researchers continue to learn more about the disease, so information about symptoms, prevention, and treatment may change as more data becomes available. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nhttps:\/\/www.yalemedicine.org\/stories\/covid-19-glossary\/\n\n#coronavirus #covid19 #sars #mers #sarscov2 #pandemic #2020 #acute #respiratory #syndrome #virus #spread #stayhome","NumberOfLikes":11,"Hashtags":["#coronavirus","#covid19","#sars","#mers","#sarscov2","#pandemic","#2020","#acute","#respiratory","#syndrome","#virus","#spread","#stayhome"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Journey to Genes on August 28, 2020 tagging @harvardmed.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598618076,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 28 14:34:36 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"MASK ON😷\n#pandemic #pandemiclife #quarantinelife😷 #mask #maskmode #vastraclub🛍👗 #dmtoorder📩","NumberOfLikes":21,"Hashtags":["#pandemic","#pandemiclife","#quarantinelife😷","#mask","#maskmode","#vastraclub🛍👗","#dmtoorder📩"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598618048,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 28 14:34:08 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Covid-19 has changed the world as it was.every country is continue putting their effort for vaccine.
