Summer may hang on for a tad longer, but fall is creeping in. The nights are cooling off, and the days are getting shorter. We started harvesting apples this week, and the bumble bees are starting to die off for the season. \n\nI know there will be wonderful things this fall, and still so much to be grateful for, but I love the summer and I hate to see it go. Change is inevitable but still hard, and with so much constant upheaval in the world, I guess it was nice to be heads down and working to the point of exhaustion in the summer sun. Looking up again is...tiring. \n\nI know it's a privilege to tune out. And I also know that the work that I'm doing is 'essential', and plays a major part in getting food to those in need, so I shouldn't devalue it as a simple distraction. But some days when I try to engage and stay aware of what's going on, all I see is people dying -- in hospital beds or at protests or at the hands of those meant to protect them. \n\nMaybe I'm mourning a lot more than the end of the summer. But the long, long days of sunshine helped ease the overwhelm a bit, and I don't see things getting a whole lot better but I do see the days getting shorter. So I'm trying to hold on a bit, I guess, to the bees and the flowers and the sun. Maybe I can store it up like a battery to pull through the fall and winter, eh?

I just follow.\nI took off my pants and socks and kneeled over the bed with my head in my pillow gripping the sheets, squeezing them with each roll of waves crashing with grace and purpose. \nBetween holding my palms towards the roof and calling in all the womxn before me, with me and beside me. \nSaying out loud. \nJust let it be, I am doing this.\nAnd it was then I saw them. \nA gathering of womxn, holding space for me. Reuniting. A galaxy of a porthole. \nAn unfolding veil. I felt warm and safe.\nI was not touched. \nI was heard and left to my own dance of birth.\nThe power was all me. \nA few times the midwife asked to use the doppler and I agreed. \nShe placed a mirror under me so I could see with each contraction baby was coming closer and closer. I knew it wouldn't last forever. I found a rhythm. \nA place that took me to ectascy. \nAnother world. A transcending fleet.\nA pleasurable mask that seemed surreal.\nAnd somehow enjoyable and orgazzmic.\nI reached my hand down and could feel baby crowing, and then a gush. \nMy waters had broken and baby had done a mecconium within.\nIt didn't worry me I knew babes was safe. \nDo you want to catch baby? \"Yes absolutely I'm so ready\"\nI reached down and gathered life on my skin, soaking in glory. Victory.\n\nTo be continued...\n. #iso\n#positivebirth\n#lockdownbaby\n#birthwithoutfear \n#melbournedoula \n#empoweredbirth\n#birthingincovid\n#pandemic\n#birthstory","NumberOfLikes":20,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Lilium Health on August 27, 2020.

Again, this data is incorrect. \n\nThis difference in 14 digits, should not be seen as cases, samples or simple numbers, but as people. Where are these 14 people? Do they even exist?

One of these risk factors is obesity. According to a recent study from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, obesity increases the risk of getting coronavirus, risk of arriving in the hospital and ICU, and risk of death. Additionally, due to a weakened immune system response, a vaccine would be less effective for people who are obeise. UNC researchers concluded that obese people had a 46% higher chance of contracting Covid and a 113% greater risk of landing in the hospital compared to non-obese people. Furthermore, obese people had a 74% increased chance of landing in the ICU and a 48% greater chance of dying compared to non-obese people. These results are very clear: Obesity is a serious risk factor of COVID-19. In order to reduce the risk of a severe case, the CDC advises obese people to take any medications for underlying conditions exactly as prescribed, immediately visit a doctor if symptoms are present, and practice good nutrition and physical activity.

We know he lied about at least SOME of the women who accused him of sexual harassment and\/or rape. We know he lied about colluding with Russia to rig the 2016 election and about how close he was with Michael Cohen, Paul Manafort, Roger Stone\u2026and whoever was getting indicted or thrown in jail that day. Presidential historian Douglas Brinkley calls Trump, \u201Ca serial liar.\u201D\u2060\nI mean, even freaking Wikipedia says, \u201CDonald Trump has made many false or misleading statements, including thousands during his presidency. Commentators and fact-checkers have described this as \u2018\"unprecedented\"\u2019 in American politics and the consistency of these falsehoods has become a distinctive part of both his business and political identity.\u201D That\u2019s putting it mildly in my estimation. The man's a full-blown Pinocchio. \u2060\nThere are lies and then there are lies that change the course of history. At this moment in history, we\u2019re facing one of the scariest foes of our generations\u2014the Covid-19 Pandemic. And the lies Trump has told about this scourge, thus shirking his responsibility to handle it, has resulted in a colossal cascade of coffins. \u2060\nCurrent US Coronavirus cases: 6,038,922 \u2060\nDeaths: 184,472\u2060\nTrump Lies: 7\/2\/20 \u201CThe pandemic is \u201Cgetting under control. 2\/27\/20 He said it would be temporary. \u201CIt\u2019s going to disappear. One day it\u2019s like a miracle. It will disappear.\u201D 7\/4\/20 \u201C99%\u201D of COVID-19 cases are totally harmless.\u201D 7\/6\/20 \u201CWe now have the lowest fatality rate in the world.\u201D\u2060\nProbably the most destructive lies have been the ones where he discourages mask wearing and thus gets away with not issuing a much-needed national mandate and plan because he won\u2019t admit that the pandemic is so out of control, which would hurt him in the election. Yes, these lies have sold a boat load of coffins. And the bulk of these deaths are all on Trump\u2019s head, or in this image, hanging from Trump\u2019s lying nose. @blueravenartist #blueravenartist #blueravenpolitical\u2060\n#dumptrump #trumplies #pandemic #blacklivesmatter #bidenharris2020 #biden2020 #voteblue #voteblue2020 #votebymail #votebymail2020 #vote \u2060","NumberOfLikes":51,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by blueravenartist on August 27, 2020.

Since then, LeBron James, a main advocate for the cancellation of the 2019-2020 season, has changed his mind though.

Please follow the guidelines and remember that not everyone has a safe space to return to.\nWhen universities close, many students can enter resource-limited or stressful domestic situations. Students may return to multi-generational homes, where maintaining boundaries may be a challenge. Students with certain characteristics may be disproportionately impacted.\nFor example,students with low socioeconomic status may have inadequate housing options, limited access to high-speed internet, and be pressured to work.Symptoms of mental health conditions have been high in college student populations since before the start of the pandemic. But relative to fall 2019, the prevalence of depression increased while substance use decreased in spring 2020. And compared to the previous year, in March to May 2020 a higher proportion of students reported that their mental health negatively impacted their academic performance.\n\n So please:\n\nWear face coverings at all times in campus buildings, outdoors when they cannot social distance from others, and wherever state or local laws require.\n\nHonor physical distancing requirements on and off campus.\n\nFollow good hand hygiene practices.\n\nStay home and seek medical care if you are ill.\n\nDon't be responsible for shutting down fall semester. \n\n#students #college #university #covid #covid19 #safe #staysafe #guidelines #coronavirus #pandemic #2020 #fallsemester #popular #instagram #follow #like #love #trending #instagood","NumberOfLikes":218,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598566023,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 28 00:07:03 CEST 2020","Location":"New York, New York"},{"CaptionText":"Ready for more?

I am always a teeny bit saddened when summer ends as I love everything about it \u2013 the long days, the mesmerizing blue skies, the sounds that uniquely belong to this season, all of the delicious, fresh produce and of course the lazy days spent by pools and on the beach.\n \nUnfortunately, for many of us, we haven\u2019t had many lazy days this summer or at all this year. We have been met with a global pandemic, educating our children from our kitchen tables and doing all we can to keep our heads afloat.\n \nWhen I walk to the post office each day to pick up our mail \u2013 I notice how quickly people look away behind their masks and I am trying to be more intentional about offering a friendly nod or hello. Two of my friends recently disclosed that they have been experiencing deep depression and anxiety this year. Even former First Lady @michelleobama shared that she has mild depression. We are all seeking, and in many cases lacking, genuine connection. The simple things \u2013 like speaking to a stranger, holding a door, texting a loved one to check on them \u2013 have suddenly become the very real threads that are holding our collective fabric together.\n \nYour extended family in Uganda experienced an overnight emergency when the entire country went into lock-down due to COVID-19. And yet, without hesitation \u2013 you helped fund emergency food bundles, academic packages for our students, dignity kits that provide both our girls and boys with hygiene products, counseling for our children and guardians, anti-malaria products to protect our families, solar lamps and income generating activities (read more about our tailoring training below) to help sustain the children and their beloved families.\n\nWhether you have been with us since Day 1 (thank you!) or you learned about us during this pandemic (welcome to the family), you are an invaluable piece of the fabric of this organization.\n\nWe simply cannot thank you enough for being in lockstep with us during this lock-down to provide critical and urgent care for families hit hardest by the pandemic.","NumberOfLikes":14,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by COU in Children of Uganda.

The use of thieves oil dates all the way back to the year 1413.  The time of the infamous Bubonic Plague (aka The Black Death) that devastated a large portion of France.  The Black Death spread like wild-fire amongst the citizens, and the doctors alike.  It seemed impossible to be in the vicinity without contracting it, and at the time, the sickness really did mean ultimate demise.\n\nDuring this time, however, four thieves were captured and charged for stealing from the sick and dying.  The thieves never contracted the plague, despite the close contact with the Black-Death victims.\n\nAt this time, the crime these 4 men committed was punishable by burning alive.  The judge was so intrigued by how these men had stayed immune to this terrible disease, that he told them if they shared their secret he would spare them of this punishment.\n\nThe Thieves told the judge their secret: they were perfume & spice merchants who were unemployed due to the closure of the seaports and the devastation of the plague.  They had prepared an essential oil recipe that when applied to their hands, ears, temples, feet & a mask over their mouths, kept them safe from infection.  The judge stayed true to his word.  The men were not burned alive, but instead, they were hanged for their crimes. Try to stay safe and healthy by keeping clean hands.\n\nCrystals \n\nAmethyst  Nature\u2019s tranquilizer, known to bring calming peaceful energy, keeping you mindful, offers protection and associated with the crown chakra. \n\nBlack Tourmaline  Protection, psychic protection, instills calm, grounds you, & blocks negativity.\nLink in bio ‚òùÔ∏è\n#spiritnest #witchesnest #fortune #handsclean #cleanhands #washyourhands #sanitize #sanitizer #covid19 #pandemic #quarantine #2020 #essentialoils #reiki #crystals #crystalhealing #thivesoil #alcohol #hand #love #flower #herb #aloevera #goddess #grateful #thankyou #coffin #goth #blessed","NumberOfLikes":96,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Spirit Nest on August 27, 2020.

On top of that, add these plates to spin: does the uniform fit, they need shoes, what shoe size are they? Can they take a lunchbox? How will I juggle the different start times? How will I make it all work? This isn't even the tip of the mental load iceberg. \n\nThis has been both tough and amazing in equal measure. \n\nFor the next few days i will be mothering in whichever way causes the least resistance. I will be doing things to make my life easier. I'll try and enjoy these last few days. But, that old bitch, 'mum guilt' will no doubt creep in. That overwhelming guilt that we all feel, whilst doing the best we can on whatever reserves we may have left in the tank. Did I do enough learning with them (absolutely not). Did I take them to new places in the last 6 weeks (nope). Did they eat healthy food (no comment, leyla has normally asked for icecream at least once by 9am). I could go on, there is enough guilt in my burnt out brain.\n\nDid we survive?I think so.It's so easy to lose yourself, the old 'me', lost in motherhood and this last 5 months is that on steroids.Motherhood is hard. We're not saying we dont want it. We're just saying it's tough.The last few months of having dictators beside me 24\/7, no breaks, no time at all, has tested me. Everything has become heightened.the noise.the mess.the attitude.the workloads.the chores.There has been no escape.

However for little over a month and a half, I experienced the headaches, diarrhea, mild fever, loss of smell followed by no taste, FATIGUE, shortness of breath, cough, and chest pains. Now months later I\u2019m still plagued by arrhythmia, swollen ankles and hair loss. Oh and nobody mentioned, the lingering mental & emotional fatigue. \n\nTruthfully writing this post is way out of my comfort zone. It\u2019s much like when I did my first sliver hair post.

Thus, each fighter with coronavirus will receive his own award separately.\n‚†Ä\n‚ùó You can order the medal for dedication in the fight against the pandemic only from the official manufacturer - the Factory of Awards company.\n‚†Ä\nWe can use laser engraving to apply any inscription and decor on the obverse and reverse of the medal‚ùó\n‚†Ä\nMedal cost: 6$ (\u203C Discounts from quantity\u203C)\n‚†Ä\n#covid #coronavirus #covid19 #covid19 #coronavirus #pandemic #covid_19 #medicine #covid #coronavirus2020 #pandemic2020 #thankstodoctors #corona #pandemiccovid #coronavirus pandemic #medal #award #order #cup #victory #coinsmedal #gift #numismatics #badges #stamping #medals #souvenir","NumberOfLikes":2,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by –§–∞–±—Ä–∏–∫–∞ –ù–∞–≥—Ä–∞–¥ on August 27, 2020.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598560499,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 27 22:34:59 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#trump #donaldtrump #Trumppence #republicans #Trumptrain #idiotinchief #trumpbodycount #Trumpvirus #trumpplague #pandemic #covid #Covidiots #covidmemes #covid19 #Worstpresidentever #fakepresident #Conservativememes #republicanmemes #Enemyofthepeople üåäüåäüá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏ #saveamerica #Voteblue2020 #bluewave #Biden2020 #joebiden #Ridinwithbiden #takeamericaback #bidenharris2020 #Occupydemocrats #joebiden2020 #Kamalaharris2020","NumberOfLikes":8,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Patriot on August 27, 2020.

As I am just coming off of a long and much needed social media break I can't help but feel immense gratitude and love for the authentic and heartfelt relationships that I have attracted over the last couple of years. (I love my yogi tribe!) Going through a pandemic and social unrest has a way of helping you appreciate and understand the power of authentic connections on another level!‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nThis video clip brings back great memories from a Ritual Hot Yoga retreat that I attended in 2019. It was perfect timing as I was at a point in my life of intentionally creating and maintaining radical self care rituals. My healing journey has taught me and led me to make radical self-care my top priority. My self-care is over everything! Making this decision has changed my life for the better and I will never turn back. ‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nWhen you decide to take care of yourself in a radical way, you must understand that your relationships and who you choose to connect with matters in a really big way. You must CHOOSE you first by deciding that your life is sacred, your heart is sacred and your energy is sacred. Remove yourself from anyone who demeans, disregards, disrespects or denies you! Deem yourself worthy of love and respect and watch how the universe lines up people in your path who can demonstrate it in your life.‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nRadical self-care is a main pillar in my coaching program! Those who embrace this methodology begin to see their lives shift in a huge way! If you'd like to join me or find out more, reach out and let's chat.

Until recently when we began serious exponential technological progress as a species, the oral report was the only way to collect, save, and pass on information. It's biological. Now, up until recently we had free reign to gather without repercussion, face-to-face. Because unless you've been marooned on an island as a soldier fighting a war that has long since come to and end and just emerged from your foxhole, you have been affected by COVID-19. Now, even though we can't ethically get together for a beer and possibly spew world ending viruses all over each other's atmosphere, we can definitely have a lovely, safe chat over the phone, recorded into a podcast to share with the rest of the ethernet world around us. No living thing can pass through that network protocol. So, we at What's Your Why have collected a few stories from across Wyoming to put each and every one of you in the shoes of someone else this pandemic season. Everyone is struggling, and no one has experienced COVID the same. Listen, read, experience, empathize, share, and spread love.

Deze foto van een weggegooid mondkapje is onderdeel van de expositie PANdemIC, nog t\/m 30 september 2020 te zien in @museumhilversum. \n\nVoor deze expositie heeft het museum samengewerkt met de Stichting Care4Corona. Iedereen kon hierbij foto\u2019s insturen bij een fotowedstrijd om de pandemie in beeld te brengen. Indrukwekkende beelden vanuit de IC, handjes tegen het raam met oma aan de andere kant, enzovoort.\n\nIk heb met mijn inzendingen juist gezocht naar de minder voorspelbare foto\u2019s, zonder iets af te willen doen aan de andere inzenders. Wat zag ik nog m√©√©r om me heen veranderd? Dat was dus ook dit weggegooide mondkapje, bij een hangplek hier in de buurt. Nonchalant gedumpt. In het verhaal van PANdemIC paste dit beeld blijkbaar ook, want hij is opgenomen in de selectie voor de fotoexpositie!\n\nMeer op tikfout. nl uiteraard! \nhttps:\/\/tikfout.nl\/marketing\/pandemic-noud-in-het-museum\/\n\n#museum #pandemic #MuseumHilversum #mondkapje #fotowedstrijd #mouthmask #trash #corona #fujifilm @fujifilmnederland","NumberOfLikes":35,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Noud de Greef in Museum Hilversum.

Seg√∫n las normas AFNOR¬™ francesas, se considera eficaz cuando tras su aplicaci√≥n observamos:\n\n- Una disminuci√≥n del n.¬∫ de microorganismosü¶† (menos de 100.000 colonias).\n\n- Su efecto no tardan m√°s de 5Ô∏è\u20E3 minutos.\n\n- Es eficaz en, al menos, 4Ô∏è\u20E3 tipos de cepas bacterianas de referencia.\n\n‚úÖEn las im√°genes del post veremos una tabla con las caracter√≠sticas principales de los antis√©pticos m√°s usados en Espa√±a. Pero m√°s concretamente:\n\n- Agua oxigenada (Per√≥xido de hidr√≥geno): Hay pocas evidencias sobre su acci√≥n bactericidaü¶†. Tiene efecto¬†desbridante¬†del tejido necr√≥tico¬†y aporta ox√≠genoüçÉ en heridas anaerobias. Adem√°s, por su acci√≥n oxidante, es desodorizanteüëÉ. Se inactiva‚èπÔ∏è frente a materia org√°nica.\n\n- Alcohol 70%: Bactericida. Usado como antis√©ptico previo a inyeccionesüíâ o extracciones. No debe usarse en heridasü§ï, ya que tiene efecto irritativo y puede formar un co√°gulo que protege las bacterias supervivientes. Se inactiva‚èπÔ∏è frente a materia org√°nica.\n\n- Clorhexidina: Bactericida de amplio espectro. No es irritante y carece de reacciones sist√©micas ya que su absorci√≥n es nulaüö´. Su actividad se ve poco interferida por la presencia de materia org√°nica‚ñ∂Ô∏è. Puede usarse en embarazadasü§∞, neonatosüë∂ (cord√≥n umbilical) y lactantesü§±.\n\n-Povidona yodada: Bactericida. Se inactiva‚èπÔ∏è en contacto con materia org√°nica. Es citot√≥xica‚ö†Ô∏è. En uso sistem√°tico, se ha descrito disfunci√≥n renal y tiroidea.

The more conversation we have about troubles or frustrations however, the more frequent we awaken unpleasant feelings that cost us morale and peace of mind. When you become serious about only discussing problems if you are seeking a solution or reflecting on a lesson learned, your mind will engage in a more productive, peaceful gear. \n\nThinking about and discussing problems are seductive because it feels like problem solving. In reality however, research has shown that prolonged and repeated focus on set-backs and difficulties don\u2019t solve the problem but instead exacerbate the stress and low morale associated with the issue.\n\nI cannot overstate that if you want a peaceful, calm mind, you will have to stop thinking and talking about the bad stuff.¬† Increase your value, discover peace of mind and attach meaning to what you do by seeking solutions, changing the problem-focused conversation and train your brain to switch to the abundance in your life, not repeatedly discussing problems.\n\n#success #successquotes #successhabits #leadership #management #happyatwork #personaldevelopment #personalgrowth #workhappy #leadershipdevelopment #thursdaythoughts #anxietyawareness #pandemic #selfcare #wellness #happy #quotestoliveby #lifegoals #gymgoals #fitness #motivationalquotes #noexcuses  #trainyourbrain  #happiness #transformation #dentalhygienist #dentistry #dentistrylife #dentalygiene","NumberOfLikes":10,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by William Nippard on August 27, 2020.

With nowhere to go and nothing to do socially, I found things to take up my time.\n\nElijah, of course, is a great way to do that. His Cameo videos have been a delight and I've been working on a little sumin, sumin that I hope will come to fruition soon. I'm always working in Adobe, I made some logos, took some photos, edited some videos (with some crazy ideas), watched some movies I've been meaning to for a spell and bingeing some television shows... old and new. The second season of The Umbrella Academy is fantastic and I'm absolutely obsessed with Hamilton. My head is continuously filled with tunes from the musical while I'm trying to hone down those lyrics.\n\nWhat things have you done to take your mind off the mundane and unsettled era that is called 2020?\n\n.\n\n.\n\n#2020 #pandemic #lockdown #activities #working #adobe #elijahwood #cameo #editing #movies #bingewatching #series #television #umbrellaacademy #hamilton #hamilfan #hamiltonmusical #musical¬†#rocketman #deadstill #sixfeetunder #drama #avengers¬†#mcu #logos #artistic #creative #website #photography","NumberOfLikes":41,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1598542939,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 27 17:42:19 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Sz 11 VNDS $120\nAlways Buying Kicks New\/Used!","NumberOfLikes":42,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Playa Soles, LLP We Buy Shoes in Playa Soles.
