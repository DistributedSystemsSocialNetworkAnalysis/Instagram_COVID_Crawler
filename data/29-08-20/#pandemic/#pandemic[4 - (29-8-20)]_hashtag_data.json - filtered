Jeremiah was walking past a game store on his way home one day, and he saw this in the window! He popped in to ask the store owner about it, then ran home to tell me about it üòÖ\nIt was halloween time, so how could we resist? We bought the game, brought it home, read the rules, and set up to play.\nAt the time, our apartment had a BIG bay window (made up of 5 large windows), and for Halloween I had strung up red-orange lights all around the windows, and hung monster cutouts in each of them. It was awesome. Our dining table was right in the middle of these spooky windows, so when we played, we turned out the regular lights and played in the ambiance of Halloween light and monster shadow.\n\nEscape Zombie City is important for a couple reasons: 1. It was the first game we bought for ourselves, and 2. It kicked off my love for zombie themed games, which will become apparent later üòÖ\n\nIs there a certain theme that you just particularly love in board games?\n\nIf anyone would like to join the #10gameschallenge to share their own journey, I\u2019d love to see your stories!\n\n@queengames_us \n\n#boardgamejourney #escapezombiecity #queengames #halloweengames #zombies #boardgames #boardgame #bgg #boardgamegeek #tabletopgames #boardgamenight #boardgamegirl #nerdwife #boardgamesofinstagram #boardgameday #meeplestation_wifeside #meeplestation #meeplegamers #gamenight #boardgamenight #boardgamecommunity #boardgamelove #boardgamelover","NumberOfLikes":271,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Kara in Rexburg, Idaho.

Appreciate the feature.\nüëâüèª Head to the link bio to read the full article.\n\nPosted @withregram \u2022 @thehindumetroplus Despite the many portrayals of bibliophiles as loners, reading can be social endeavour. Abigail Williams, in her book 'The Social Life of Books\u2019 writes about the prevalence of communal reading in 18th Century England. \nReading together was necessary then, for two reasons: In the absence of modern printing technologies, not everyone owned a book; and it was the only way people with poor sight could consume a book as ophthalmology was underdeveloped and bulbs didn\u2019t exist. In the following centuries, technologies progressed, eyesight got better, books were aplenty, reading became more solitary. \n\nYet the inherent need to share stories never changed. Book discussions are now more interpersonal and unorganised, but there have always been manifestations of the 18th Century reading groups in the form of book clubs.\n\nA book club can connect a doctor, an entrepreneur, a homemaker and a college student through their shared love for reading. The #pandemic, however, halted most clubs\u2019 regular get-togethers. \n\n@praveensudevan looks at how book clubs in India have been coping with #COVID19.

Puncak musim kemarau yang terjadi pada bulan Juli dan Agustus adalah waktu yan tepat untuk menerbangkan layang-layang\n\nAngin kencang dan langit cerah menjadi daya pikat bagi para \u2018penerbang\u2019 untuk melambungkan layang-layangnya lebih tinggi. Bisa bermain layang-layang tanpa gangguan tiang listrik dan lalu-lalang kendaraan adalah sebuah kemewahan tersendiri bagi warga Jakarta, karena permainan sederhana ini membutuhkan ruang terbuka yang luas, yang sudah sangat jarang bisa ditemukan di Ibukota\n\nSejak pukul 15.00 WIB warga berkumpul dan membawa layangan andalannya masing- masing. Beberapa warga ada yang baru membeli layang-layang dan benang gelasan di Hek, sebuah toko yang khusus menjual pernak-pernik layangan di daerah Halim, Jakarta Timur. Toko Hek telah berdiri sejak tahun 1994 dan selama dua dekade lebih selalu memenuhi kebutuhan para \u2018penerbang\u2019\n\nAgar tidak terjadi bentrok, warga telah membagi lahan bermain menjadi dua. Lapangan depan digunakan untuk anak-anak kecil yang biasa menerbangkan layangan jenis sukhoi. Mereka sering kali adu ketangkasan dengan layangan sukhoi ini. Sementara para remaja dan bapak-bapak berkumpul lebih jauh di lapangan belakang. Mereka menyukai layangan jenis koang yang lebih besar, beragam bentuknya dan membutuhkan keahlian tingkat tinggi untuk menerbangkannya\n.\n.\n.\n#coronavirus #covid2019 #asia #southeastasia #jakarta #indonesia #pandemic #photojournalism #everydaycovid19 #reportagespotlight #people  #quarantine #largescalesocialrestriction #psbb #newnormal #jakarta #indonesia #layangan #layanglayang #kites #koang #sukhoi","NumberOfLikes":256,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1598527694,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 27 13:28:14 CEST 2020","Location":"Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"CaptionText":"Parenting in this digital world?

It goes on to say that students who test positive are not considered an exposure risk if masks were worn and social distancing was practiced\u2014meaning the students and professor may never be informed if someone in their class tests positive.¬† Multiple other emails from other departments reviewed warn teachers against telling students about a positive classmate or posting about it on social media, even in the most general terms, claiming it could constitute a HIPAA violation. Professors who spoke said the policy made them feel unsafe on campus. Asked about the email, Associate VP for Communications Monica Watts directed The Daily Beast to the official guidance on its website, which states that, \u201Cfor privacy reasons, the instructor should not announce to the class that a student in the class has tested positive, even anonymously.\u201D The crisis in Tuscaloosa comes amid similar outbreaks at schools across the country, Both the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Notre Dame were forced to move to online-only classes after a spike in cases this month. Dozens of schools have reported widespread outbreaks in their sports programs and Greek life communities, and some\u2014including the University of Alabama\u2014have suspended all gatherings and social events.

Set over three days, mostly in a city centre maternity hospital as one nurse tries her best to care for pregnant women amidst the chaos and unpredictability that is a global pandemic, poverty amongst most of her patients and the medical knowledge of the time. \n\nI love books set in Dublin, my hometown, and it made for extremely interesting reading, almost like a true narrative of the time. I loved reading about the conditions and state of Dublin after the Rising, along with thoughts of fathers, brothers, uncles away fighting for King and Country on the front lines of World War 1. It really gave a good overall sense of what Dublin was like during that time. The similarities from that time of trying to curb the spread of the \"grip\" as the Spanish Flu was known as, was fascinating. \n\nHowever, this is a slow burner, and there are a lot of details, in fact in some parts I found it to be overly descriptive and here I found it difficult to maintain my interest in the book. On the whole though, a very interesting read that gives a lot of food for thought on today's current pandemic situation. üåüüåüüåü\n\n#bookstagram #bookstagrammer #bookreview #bookaddict #bibliophile #thepullofthestars #bookphotography #emmadonighue #readabook #booksmakemehappy #readingtime #kindle #bookcommunity #bookchat #smbcaug1 #lovetoread #booksbooksbooks #readingisfundamental #irishbookblogger #pandemic #dublin #bookaholic #bookishfeed #historicalfiction #goodreadschallenge #tbr #netgalley #fortheloveofbooks #irishbookstagrammer","NumberOfLikes":170,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Elaine's Reviews Ireland üáÆüá™ in Dublin, Ireland with @girlsbookishlove, and @bookishsupport.

They work with people who have active addictions, as well as those already in recovery. Recovery coaches are helpful for making decisions about what to do with one's life and the part addiction or recovery plays in it. They help clients find ways to stop addiction (abstinence), or reduce harm associated with addictive behaviors. These coaches can help a client find resources for harm reduction, detox, treatment, family support and education, local or online support groups; or help a client create a change plan to recover on their own.\n\nRecovery coaches do not offer primary treatment for addiction, do not diagnose, and are not associated with any particular method or means of recovery. They support any positive change, helping persons coming home from treatment to avoid relapse, build community support for recovery, or work on life goals not related to addiction such as relationships, work, or education. Recovery coaching is action-oriented with an emphasis on improving present life and reaching future goals.\n\nRecovery coaching is unlike most therapy because coaches do not address the past, do not work to heal trauma, and put little emphasis on feelings. Recovery coaches are unlike licensed addiction counselors in that they are non-clinical and do not diagnose or treat addiction or any mental health issues. #recoverycoach @intlrecoveryspecialists @evyanelizabeth @intl_recovery_coach @janiqueprivate #covid19 #pandemic","NumberOfLikes":525,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Janique Svedberg on August 27, 2020.

We'll discuss potential opportunities by adding online elements to your business offerings such as courses and digital products, all while focusing on how these can be integrated into your existing business model and tailored to suit your personality and goals.\n\nThis has never been more important than now as we face uncertainty during the pandemic and related lockdowns.\n\nA Spark Session works on the principle that real value can be found by shifting perspective from the day-to-day of running your business and taking a broader, longer-term view, and gleaning insight from an outside perspective. Inspiration is important and so is action. By the end of this session you will have created an actionable goal as well as a plan for how to achieve this, all with in-built accountability.\n\nTo find out more (and score yourself a discount!) visit: http:\/\/tracyhallcreative.com\/spark\n\n#businesscoaching #pandemic #businessstrategy #resilience #entrepreneurship #entrepreneur #boss #lockdown","NumberOfLikes":6,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Tracy Hall on August 26, 2020.

But since it\u2019s her first time... She\u2019s still in the phase of adjusting in the new set up of learning. Well most of us actually. üòä\n\nI just feel a little emotional how our kids now especially those who haven\u2019t started school yet, can experience the so-called distance learning. It\u2019s really a different experience at first especially before when you as a parent get used to excitedly seeing your classmates and teachers, giddy about your new and cool school stuff, happily sharing your baon\/snack to your classmates, embracing your best friends and etc.\n\nI hope this #pandemic will end so our children can still experience the education that we parents have experienced.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on these mommies? üòä\n\nAnd oh, @mindchamps.ph is having their Free trial class.
