Who Is Involved In The Obama Gate And Pizza Gate Scandals? https:\/\/youtu.be\/8wcWagoPWZs\n\nThe virus and pandemic continues to shake the world to its core. The situation in the U.S and EU is getting worse with each passing day and the virus and pandemic has resurfaced in China. Trump recently announced that the WHO was a pawn and puppet of China and that the U.S will cut its funding for the organization. In addition, Trump mentioned that he would soon make an important announcement about the WHO and that he is not happy with the fact that they are treating China like a developing nation and that they are benefitting from rights that U.S cannot. Trump said that we could have severed that tie with China and as a result could have saved 500 billion dollars; this option is still on the table. The deep state through Trump is putting the WHO and the world trade organization on the side of China, London and the globalist elite. This clash between these two sides is the main reason behind the turbulence taking place in the world today.\nFurthermore, Trump announced that James Comey the head the FBI remained loyal to Obama and hid valuable information from me and presented it to Obama, this is Obama gate. As we mentioned in previous videos, he was indirectly bringing Pizza gate to the forefront. The deep state wants to include Trumps opponent Joe Biden in the scandals of Pizza gate and Obama gate before the elections.\n\nFollow OTRV On Instagram at: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/otrvideo\/\nFollow OTRV On Twitter At: https:\/\/twitter.com\/OTRVideos\nFollow OTRV On Facebook At: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/offtherecord.otrv.3\n\n#pızzagate #obamagate #billclinton #hillaryclinton #johnpodesta  #tonypodesta  #jeffreyepstein #epstein #rothschild  #jamesalefantis #georgesoros  #opensocietyfoundations #princeandrew #royalfamily #virus #pandemic #america #china #usa #trump #who #joebiden #jamescomey #london #elite #fbi #eu","NumberOfLikes":17,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by OTRV on August 26, 2020.

It refers to how much we can handle before we dysregulate. \n\nAs parents, we strive to be in the optimal zone. This is the feeling of \"I've got this\" when we are met with difficult moments in our home. We are centered, calm and the ideal version of ourselves. \n\nWhen we are out of our window it is harder to stay in control and we can be thrown off balance more easily. \n\nThis concept provides us with a better understanding of ourselves and a starting point to discover what makes our tolerance higher and lower. It goes without saying that all of our rivers are probably a little narrower due to this pandemic and all that it has thrust upon us. \n\nHowever, when we turn self-blame to curiosity we can begin to give ourselves a little bit of grace, compassion and hopefully develop more strategies to stay within our window during times of stress.\n\nThe strategies provided are general, but I would love to hear how you all widen your rivers\/window of tolerance.

Growing up in a household with a patriarchal dominance and being born with a last name that symbolizes insuperiority as a women has only encouraged me to push further than what the status quo expects of me. #girlpower\n\nThis summer, I co-founded a nonprofit organization with a few other amazing and beautiful high school girls.

So I wanna talk about one moment of this ride, which happened yesterday. \n\nTuesday was chemo #3. That morning, I listened to some boss ass music, danced around while getting ready and SMILED the whole ride down. I felt GOOD! Optimistic! My tumors, 2 of which I can feel, have gone from hard and spikey to soft and even a little smushy. The chemo is working!\n\nAt Penn, I got my labs and eagerly waited to chat with the oncologist prior to my infusion. The past 2 appointments, my lab work was AWESOME! Yep, braggin about the stuff swirling in my blood. \n\nIt\u2019s all about the WBCs and neutrophils, the BADASS fighters of infection that live in your blood. The past 2 infusions...mine were PERFECTION! That meant, I didn\u2019t need an extra shot. I was killin it...UNTIL yesterday. \n\nMy itty bitty fighters were within range for someone not getting chemo. BUT, chemo crushes them and this time I would need to boost them with this NASTY shit called Neulasta. It pulls cells from from your bones...so imagine the INTENSE pain that comes with that. F*CK! \n\nMy happy, optimistic mood sunk into the pit of my stomach. Another hit. Another thing thrown at me. MAKE IT STOP! \n\nWell, today at 445pm, the shot was delivered into my arm. The anticipation of possible EXTREME side effects SUCKEDY SUCKS! I\u2019m taking meds in hopes that I can ward off the bone pain. Some people are lucky and those work. I NEED to be one of those people! Shit! Chemo and now this crap! Are we all having a blast?!\n\nThis is cancer. You\u2019re floating on air and having one of your BEST mornings. Then BAM! The rollercoaster I didn\u2019t even buy a ticket for plummets hard! Nothing else to say except  F*CK CANCER! \n\n#fuckcancer #chemotherapy #chemohair #chemosucks #coldcapping #breastcancer #breastcancerawareness #breastcancerwarrior #momwithcancer #hotmess #hotmessmomlife #motherhoodunplugged #motherhood #momsofinstagram #momlife #mom #reallife #truth #vulnerability #chemosideeffects #pandemic #neulasta #cancerrollercoaster #chemorollercoaster","NumberOfLikes":16,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Kimberly Hyman on August 26, 2020.

When I think of Summer, I always think of  locally grown tomatoes. That flavor explosion-sweet, salty, tangy, a little citrusy in your mouth! I think of Italy, of how Italians love tomatoes and pasta and how I love these things too. I ponder how one day I will go there and make the same sauce but with Italian tomatoes. Secrets: Boil , cook on medium, stir, cook on medium, repeat  about 2-4 hours. Durung the process, add crushed garlic, fresh summer onion, basil oh, oregano, turmeric, organic tomato paste, marjoram and sea salt. And when it is done, taste it and prepare to experience heaven!! It doesn't get better than this and our amazing Ohio summer has made this possible. Blessings in the middle of a pandemic.

The energy we take out with us, generally speaking, transfers to each other and we go out with every intention of making our happier selves... happier. That's what bars are for right? \n\nWhat is the presumed course of action, however, when we are sad? Largely we sit alone and feel alone. \n\nPhysics cheats us in to making time fly by when we're happy, yet it feels like wading through treacle when we're sad. It's a cruel universal truth.\n\nI begin to wonder. Is it an unshakeable truth that we are alone when we're sad? Yes, most of us have at least one person we can share are darkest selves with. But even if we do, we often feel unable to share certain aspects of ourselves with them.  And some of us are just alone.\n\nWe predominantly rely on a crumbling mental health system that heavily relies on medication or a referal to a generic therapy service that you have to wait often weeks if not months to access. \n\nWe don't want to go 'out' when we're sad. Or perhaps, if we look closer, we don't want to be surrounded by happy people when we're sad. \n\nWe are presented by happiness on social media and in social spheres.  It's a conspiracy but I think there's an epidemic of shame and denial that sadness exists at all. \n\nLet's get dystopian. We have sex clubs. Shooting clubs. Gin bars. Gay bars.\n\nLet's say bars did exist in the future or another world that specialised and catered for... the sad. Where we could go in unashamed and be there for a stranger. For eachother. I often wonder if the most qualified person to help a sad person, is a sad person.\n\nSo...

A small study recently found that #stress has TRIPLED for pregnant women since the beginning of the pandemic.\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\"There is a lot of literature that supports the idea that stressors during #pregnancy can have a deleterious effect on #fetalbrain development,\" said Charles Nelson, a professor at @harvardmed and @bostonchildrens.\n\u2022\n\u2022\nHormones released during stressful periods are able to cross the placental barrier between mother and baby, thus impacting the fetus\u2019s health. And \u201C[a] study published earlier this year in @jamapeds found marked differences in the growing fetal brains among pregnant women who were psychologically distressed.\u201D\n\u2022\n\u2022\nCatherine Limperopoulos, of Developing Brain Institute at Children's National Health System, has been surveying pregnant women about their perceived levels of stress since 2014. Since the onset of the pandemic, reported symptoms of #stress, #anxiety and #depression have doubled or nearly tripled.\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\"Even in the setting of a low-risk pregnancy, where the mom has no risk factors and the baby is developing well,\" Limperopoulos said, \"there really is an alarming prevalence of #mentalhealth problems reported by these women.\"\n\u2022\n\u2022\nTo add insult to injury, it has been well documented that the #coronavirus has disproportionately impacted racial minorities, especially the Black \/ African American communities, even more so with pre-existing conditions.\n\u2022\n\u2022\nHowever, since stress can be managed, Limperopoulos and her team are now spearheading Project RESCUE, a randomized study evaluating the effectiveness of  interventions such as #mindfulness, #yoga, #breathing techniques, and #sleep health for #expectant moms.\n\u2022\n\u2022\nLearn more: https:\/\/developingbrainresearchlaboratory.org\/rescue.html\n\u2022\n\u2022\nArticle link: http:\/\/ow.ly\/aHOI50Ba3rt\n\u2022\n\u2022\nPC @nbcnews\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n#MMH #PMADS #momsmatter #selfcare #pandemic","NumberOfLikes":27,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by MMHLA on August 26, 2020.

As individuals, we've had to make changes \u2013 both big and small \u2013 to our everyday lives.\nBut while physically distanced, the internet and social media have allowed us to reach into each other\u2019s homes over the past weeks. Social relationships for many seem not to have suffered. They have also allowed us to explore hobbies and interests we might never have had before \u2013 like the people turning to social media to solve real-life mysteries from their homes.\nWhile being enormously disruptive and painful, crises also invariably nurture the emergence of great common purpose, solidarity, creativity, and improvisation. And social media has opened little windows into how everybody else has responded and found their own coping mechanisms. Shortages of commonplace items, or difficulties in getting out to the shops or securing a delivery slot, or perhaps just that many of us have more time on our hands these days, has unlocked an inner creativity and resourcefulness that can be shared widely online. \n\n❇️ By \u201CLewis Dartnell\u201D 29th June 2020\n\n✅You can find the whole article here: \nhttps:\/\/www.bbc.com\/future\/article\/20200629-which-lockdown-changes-are-here-to-stay\n\n#coronavirus #pandemic #newnormal #corona #lockdown #newlife #changinglives","NumberOfLikes":2,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by WISC Life on August 26, 2020.

Months?).. It's no lie that we (and many other business owners) have been struck by unfortunate events due to Covid-19. Our production has been delayed several times due to covid-19, both in terms of lockdown, strict working guidelines, the employees from our supplier getting covid (they are OK), and disinfection and close down of the factory after every case of covid-19. So much has been out of our hands and we have only been able to stand by and wait. \nOur clothes were shipped maybe approximately 3 weeks ago now but have still not reached Denmark as our luck with freight companies continue.😔 Our styles were shipped from India to Singapore. There the plane was over-filled and they couldn't take our parcel on board. Now, here it gets tricky. The freight company then changed tracking number out of nowhere. Our old tracking number showed it was on the way, but the new one showed it was stuck in Singapore🤦🏼\u200D♂️🤦🏼\u200D♀️ Then after a week the shipping company sends it back to India where they ship it to another location and even a whole other part of India than where it was shipped from. Our supplier has finally located our parcel but are now struggling to have the freight company ship the parcel directly to Denmark and not back to the factory and then Denmark. Oh man. We know that it will take approximately 6 working days if they ship it back to our supplier before sending it and 2-4 if they ship it directly. \nSo, your pre-orders are on their way. They've just been on a little adventure, some would say detour, and are now being monitored closely. With that said, we want to apologize for the long waiting. We have learned from this and will be careful with future pre-orders. We are deeply sorry for the inconvenience and hope you know we are doing everything we can to get your orders home!❤️","NumberOfLikes":16,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Sustainable Slow Fashion on August 26, 2020.

Let me know: Would you add this book to your list? \n2. If you read it: What\u2019s your rating? What are your thoughts? Would you recommend it?\n\nRating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️💫\/5 \n\nA VERY Short @goodreads Summary:\n\nEducated is an account of the struggle for self-invention. It is a tale of fierce family loyalty and of the grief that comes with severing the closest of ties. With the acute insight that distinguishes all great writers, Westover has crafted a universal coming-of-age story that gets to the heart of what an education is and what it offers: the perspective to see one's life through new eyes and the will to change it.\n\nTHE READ AFTER THE READ: \n\nEmotional AF: It\u2019s hard to rate a memoir because you can\u2019t just rate someone else\u2019s life. At first, it was hard for me to read how I normally do because there\u2019s alot to unpack here. It\u2019s \u201Cemotional\u201D because it made me very angry to read what Tara Westover had to go through with her abusive family growing up. Had me cursing EVERY👏🏽BODY👏🏽AND👏🏽THEIR👏🏽MAMA👏🏽OUT👏🏽! \n\nThought-provoking AF: Some people take having the opportunity of an education for granted. Sad, but it\u2019s more common than not. It really made me realize how blessed I was to be able to continue my education because a lot of people don\u2019t have the luxury or the means to do the same. It also shared the lesson that I\u2019ve lived and known every day of my life: not everybody is meant to come along with you during your journey of personal development, especially if they\u2019re toxic. My Scorpio self\u2019s cutoff game is LETHAL! If I feel like someone is shady, doesn\u2019t have my best interest at heart or doesn\u2019t want to see me fulfill my dreams, and are stunting my growth\u2026 no matter who you are, ✂️✌🏽\n\nInspirational AF: This story has also made me think about how, as individuals, we have to make our own choices for ourselves and our future. No matter our circumstances or the examples around us, we have the ability to break generational and community curses by walking to the beat of our own drum and wanting better for ourselves. No matter how outlandish it may sound to others, believe in yourself and your dream, have faith, and make that move!","NumberOfLikes":156,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Jaz Imani🌙🌻 on August 26, 2020 tagging @randomhouse.

Maskapai itu dan maskapai lainnya di AS, telah dilarang merumahkan pekerja hingga 30 September di bawah persyaratan paket bantuan federal senilai US$ 25 miliar (sekitar RP 350 triliun) yang dikhususkan bagi operator penerbangan untuk menghadapi krisis corona.\n\nSetelah bantuan itu berakhir, perusahaan merasa tidak akan sanggup mempertahankan pekerjanya dikarenakan pendapatannya terganggu akibat permintaan perjalanan yang turun drastis. American Airlines mengatakan kapasitas kuartal keempatnya akan menjadi setengah dari level tahun lalu dan penerbangan jarak jauh internasional hanya akan mencakup 25% dari jadwal 2019.\n\nPasca PHK Oktober, maskapai itu mengatakan jumlah karyawannya yang diberhentikan akan menjadi sekitar 40.000 orang. Angka itu sudah menghitung cuti 17.500 pekerja serikat, termasuk pramugari, pilot dan mekanik, dan 1.500 pekerjaan administrasi dan manajemen.\n\n#WorldHealthOrganization #CoronavirusPandemic #CoronaPandemic #COVIDPandemic #COVID19 #Coronavirus #COVID19Pandemic #WHOSwitzerland #WHOIndonesia #WHOInternational #CoronavirusDisease2019 #Pandemic #GlobalPandemic #CNBCIndonesia #PandemiCorona #PandemiKorona #PandemiCOVID19 #MediaLawanCOVID19 #BersamaLawanCorona #LawanCorona #MediaPemersatuBangsa #KnowledgeToElevate #IndonesiaMelawanCOVID19 #IniBaruTRANS7 #TVRI #MetroTV #TRANS7","NumberOfLikes":6,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Yoga-kun in CNN Indonesia with @who, @americanair, @officialtrans7, @telkomindonesia, @whophilippines, @cnnindonesia, @detikcom, @metrotvtoday, @metrotv, @tvrinasional, @whoeurope, @news_trans7, @transvisionid, @cnnidpr, @precure_curesta, @cnbcindonesia, @transmediajabar, @whoindonesia, @detikfinanceofficial, and @who.searo.

I know all of us can be a little low in spirits at times, but this pandemic has taken a heavy toll on our elderly. At least half of my hospice patients are in facilities, still guided by strict visitation restrictions. They miss having visitors, activities, special music, church. They need reminders that they are not alone, that they are loved, that life is beautiful and that laughter is good for the soul.\n.\nI need your help!! I don\u2019t believe things will change for our elderly population anytime soon, so I am collecting as many cheerful creations as possible that I can distribute to my patients and their neighbors, to lift their spirits and give them hope. You, your kids, their neighborhood friends and classmates could put together a stack of creations!! I will get them from you, disinfect them, and deliver them to my beloved patients! It would mean the world to them. Message me if you are interested in helping me out!

Your life is priceless, and your monthly premium is bound to reflect that, right? Turns out, it doesn't have to.\n\nVarious programs are available for individuals and families. The trick is to know which type is best for you and your wallet. We offer term, whole, or universal solutions that are personalized to suit your needs and budget. A term policy may be right for you while you're young and single - premiums tend to be lower while coverage remains inclusive enough to alleviate a potential burden on your loved ones in the case of unexpected loss or hardship. On the other hand, you might prefer a whole or universal policy that generates cash value over time and protects you and your family throughout your entire life. The Piedmont Group can help you find the best fit.\n\nWe employ our patented Tailored Risk Solution approach when assessing your lifestyle protection needs. It starts with a conversation. We will conduct a professional introductory meeting with you, in person or virtually, to assess your specific needs.

It is not about those four walls, but it is about those four people whom I miss like hell. 😞My mom's affection, my dad's taunts and those silly fights with my siblings.😫 I never thought that I would miss these things as they came easily to me. This pandemic made me realize 😅that these little things are the ones we care & crave for.. \n\nBut then, thanks to the technology🤗 that provided me with my saviour. Yes, those conference calls & video calls which are keeping that little thing alive inside me. 🥰Whenever I need help in kitchen, I'd call my mom. Because the way she nags about my cooking skills feels like home, always. Whenever things go south, I'd call my best enemy who is miles apart. Because he never fails to bring a smile on my face and makes me feel comfortable with his🤭 lame jokes...\n\nI don't know how you felt😒 after hearing about the lockdown extension.

It threatens everyone, and we all must cooperate to lower the chance that the coronavirus harms any one individual. Among other things, that means keeping safe social distances and wearing masks. But many people choose not to do these things, making spread of infection more likely.\u201C\n\n\u201CTo me, it seems the problem of coronavirus defectors could be solved by moral enhancement: like receiving a vaccine to beef up your immune system, people could take a substance to boost their cooperative, pro-social behavior,\u201D Crutchfield says, acknowledging that the idea is a \u201Cfar-out proposal that\u2019s bound to be controversial.\u201D\n\nNationalFile report: The bioethics professor goes on to bemoan the gall of citizens who refuse to comply with mask mandates, and recommends \u201Cmoral enhancement,\u201D which he describes as \u201Cthe use of substances to make you more moral.\u201D\n\n\u201CThen, perhaps, the people who choose to go maskless or flout social distancing guidelines would better understand that everyone, including them, is better off when they contribute, and rationalize that the best thing to do is cooperate,\u201D Crutchfield argues, adding that the main drawbacks to moral enhancement are that \u201Cthe science isn\u2019t developed enough,\u201D and that people may refuse to take the so-called moral enhancement pills.\n\n\"IT'S ALWAYS THESE NERD LOOKING MUTHAFUCKAS WHO THINK OF SHIT LIKE THIS LOL.

Water bottles, rocks, and fireworks were aimed at police, who in returned fired rubber bullets and tear gas into the crowd of people. Protesters dispersed and moved several blocks away.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nThat is when things took a turn for the worse. In video footage of the melee, a white vigilante appears on video brazenly walking down the street with his long gun. Reports say he had already shot someone in the stomach a few blocks away and was reportedly being chased by protesters trying to subdue him.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nThe gunman is seen on video falling to the ground, and that is when he fires his gun, striking and killing two people.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nAfterwards, police who likely heard the gunshots swarmed the area in patrol cars and fortified vehicles, from the video we see the gunman\u2014with his gun still clearly visible around his chest, put his hands in the air.

Change is not something that most people accept easily, especially when it comes to values or beliefs, which they have had for a long time. Sometimes, the emotional investments in those values or beliefs are so great that people cannot accept the notion of change. This detrimental practice has facilitated the conscious withdrawal of efficiency in so many aspects of life.\n\nThe main objective for people is to learn how to expect change so they can step into the future without experiencing pain. Our language structure needs alternation so we can start accepting significant global recommendations. The way we see our fellow human beings from other cultures needs to change as we learn that there are no races or creeds but we are all one species. People need to have access to information to investigate different perspectives and widen their understanding to expect change.\n\nThe challenge is to abandon notions that do not correspond with observable reality. We, as human beings, need to accept that praying for help from a deity or hoping that things will turn out are only examples of wishful thinking. There are no good or bad people but conditions that make people behave the way they do. Earth is a single organism, supporting life and we are part of it just like every other living creature. And most of all, that we must work together to create an environment that would support our evolution into the future.\n\nTheVenusproject.com","NumberOfLikes":148,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by 10.230.303 on August 26, 2020 tagging @thevenusproject.

Already she had seen more life than many people twice her age. At 17 she had graduated and taken nurse training. The war was on and the US of A newly in it. The boys were going \u201Cover there\u201D and Arianna with them. She served at a battalion hospital for several months, witness to more death and heart-wrenching suffering than she could have imagined possible while growing up in rural Minnesota. Then, the first wave of the misnamed Spanish Flu hit. She fell victim while tending the ill soldiers and it nearly killed her. She was shipped to Boston after she recovered and stationed there working with newly arriving amputees. When the second wave struck America in the fall of 1918 her mother insisted she come home. Even there, in their little community, the deadly disease was stealing the lives of young, old, and otherwise healthy people in their twenties and thirties. Young Reverend Olsen died a week after the heartbreak of laying his little son Simon to rest. All that summer Arianna watched her sisters and helped on the farm. They stayed close and had no visitors... and no suitors.

Depression in elderly individuals may have a varied presentation, and it may be difficult to diagnose. It has devastating consequences and contributes significantly to misery in this phase of life. It is associated with increased risk of morbidity, decreased physical, cognitive, and social functioning, and greater self-neglect. Depression not only decreases the quality of life, but it also influences prognosis of other chronic diseases that further aggravates disability.

In the US, decisions about who could vote were left up to the states. The 19th amendment, ratified in 1920, ensures voting rights for everyone regardless their GENDER. \n\nToday, Women\u2019s Equality Day celebrates the achievements of women\u2019s rights activists and reminds us of the unique daily struggles that women face. \n\nSo with that being said, USE YOUR VOICE IN 2020 AND VOTE or don\u2019t complain.

The Mediterranean Diet is proof positive that eating healthy is fun and flavorful. Here is sopa de Albondigas or meatball soup with spinach, tomato, eggs, chickpeas, and lots of saffron and chicken broth. It\u2019s very refreshing, hot, and steamy.

On April 23rd, 2020, the Government announced initiatives that were aimed toward helping citizens cope with the impact of the COVID-19.\n\nA report by NASA Earth Observatory quotes \u201CGreen spaces most strongly protect against mood disorders, depression, neurotic behaviour, and stress-related issues, the study found that psychological restoration may be the strongest protective mechanism that green spaces offer. The effect of green spaces is also dose-dependent, meaning those who have longer exposures to green spaces have greater mental health benefits.\u201D\n\nMany reputed researchers agree that green spaces can have a restorative effect on the human mind. Forests and national parks are just two examples of greenspace areas that may help individuals decrease levels of mental unrest, stress, anxiety caused by this pandemic. \n\nThe presence of green areas in Barbados is much less than most of the Caribbean countries. The total land area of Barbados is 43,000 hectares and only 2,000 hectares are covered with forest, and 40 hectares of mangrove.  The green area totals only 4.65%. Simply put, green space in Barbados is scarce. \n\nThe Graeme Hall Nature Sanctuary, a protector of green space, is one of the best places for the Barbadians to enjoy nature and take advantage of what it can provide to our mental health and well-being. \n\nWe hope that the people in positions of policy and changemaking in Barbados will realize the dire importance in protecting the greenspace in Barbados and take proactive actions to ensure that the people of Barbados can enjoy it now and into the future.\n#graemehallnaturesanctuary #savegraemehallnaturesanctuary #barbados🇧🇧 #covid19 #coronavirus #quarentine #pandemic #savetheplanet #savetheocean #nature #sanctuary #peace #ecofriendly #corruption #wellness #wellbeing #anxiety #deppresion #stress #relief","NumberOfLikes":0,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598461189,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 26 18:59:49 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"There are so many ongoing stressors today: social injustice, coronavirus, school, hurricanes and the list can go on, but you can find rest in the comfort of God\u2019s word.

So much of our headspace is working out details that either have already happened or could possibly take place. Meanwhile life is happening in the now. \n\n\u2022\nGod is so powerful he resides in all three spaces. The past, the future, and the present. However, it\u2019s fascinating to recall the moment in Genesis Chapter 2 when we read: \u201COn the seventh day God completed the work he had been doing; he rested on the seventh day from all the work he had undertaken.\u201D Why did God rest? He\u2019s God. \n\n\u2022\nThere is peace found in receiving. Whether it is stopping to take in the simplicity of life or in simple joys like laughter. There is also a peace that can only be found in stillness. You have to stop in order to receive it. You have to rest. \n\n\u2022\nThis forced pause on the world has been anything but peaceful. As a whole we have seen so much unrest and pain surface to a level we can no longer deny. However, in our own private lives so many of us have found a simplicity we didn\u2019t know we needed. So many families have gotten stronger. So many marriages have become more fortified. Is this because we are all faced with only being promised with the current now? \n\n\u2022\nThe past we grieved we now know and accept no longer exists. And the future we grieved we now know and accept might never be what we had imagined. But the present is now where we know to focus and accept. This new everyday is starting to make sense. Somewhere a shift happened and we all learned to rest. \n\n#peace #rest #receive #Hope #love #faith #catholic #family #prayer #catholiccreative #instagramblogger #marriage #vocation #bepresent #reflect #acceptance #catholicspeaker #catholicwoman #femininegenius #catholiclife #catholicfamily #catholicmarriage #forgiveness #pandemic #hurricanelaura #texas #hillcountry #newglasses","NumberOfLikes":105,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Liv Harrison in Log Country Cove.

No traffic, no one out\r\nand about. I feel slowly & cautiously it is now waking up.\r\n\r\r\nThe store I visited today was fairly empty. They were checking everyone's temperature & dispensing sanitizers. Everyone with masks on, keeping a feet apart.\r\nThe outing was devoid of seeing People smile at one-another, to see actual faces.\r\n\r\r\nI guess, the World will stay forever divided between Pre-Covid & Post-Covid eras, and it will take a while before everything goes back to how it used to be.\n\nHowever, i have a feeling in my Heart that this new era, has brought many changes!\nThere is a new found respect and love for slow-living, simple-living & close-knitness in Families! These past 6 months have made us unanimously agree that we don't need much to be Happy! \n\nThus, I see a NEW WORLD emerging, as it took a PANDEMIC to break our OLD PATTERNS!!\n\nType me a YES if you agree!!\n\n-- hashtags --\n\n#dothebestyoucan #goforward #staypositiveandloveyourlife #betterdaysarecoming #circumstances #situations #humanbehaviour #thoughtprovoking #understandinglife #lessonslearnedinlife #lifesayings #lifeisfun #enjoymoments #selflovewarrior #selfworthmovement #selflovetribe  #youdeservetobehappy #selfesteemboost #worthyoflove #upliftingquotes #encouragingquotes #healingfromwithin #emotionalwellness #exclamatingquotes #covid #pandemic #coronavirus #lockdown #quarantine #newworld","NumberOfLikes":29,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Exclamating Quotes on August 26, 2020.

Anyone? No? \n\nShortly after we were married, @meeplestation and I started looking for simple activities we could do together. I remembered that my brother had gotten this \u201Cteam game\u201D years and years ago called Pandemic, and he had left it behind when he moved out for a bit.\nSo, the next time I was at my parents\u2019 house, I snuck into my brother\u2019s room like a wiley little trash-panda and stole it for myself! That\u2019s right, my board game journey started with a crime.\nWe took the Pandemic back to our apartment, read the rules, and played our first game. We lost. So we played again, and lost again! Third time\u2014 lost. But the fourth time, we won! And it was exhilarating! Ohhh we were hooked, and we started to wonder... what other cooperative games might be out there...?\n\nThanks for reading along my board game journey! I\u2019d love to hear yours too\u2014 even if it\u2019s not the full 10 games series 😊 If you want to join in the challenge, or share your story, please do!\n\n@zmangames_ \n\n#pandemic #pandemicboardgame #zmangames #boardgamejourney #boardgames #boardgame #bgg #boardgamegeek #tabletopgames #boardgamenight #boardgamegirl #nerdwife #boardgamesofinstagram #boardgameday #meeplestation_wifeside #meeplestation #meeplegamers #gamenight #boardgamenight #boardgamecommunity #boardgamelove #boardgamelover","NumberOfLikes":348,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Kara in Rexburg, Idaho.
