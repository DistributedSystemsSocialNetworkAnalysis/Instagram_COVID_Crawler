But I feel that this needs to be seen by everyone. \n\nThe protests are no longer peaceful, and people are beginning to stand up for property that is being destroyed. This is what happens when things escalate to this level. \n\n\u2014- \u2014- \u2014- \u2014- \u2014- \u2014- \u2014-\n\u2022\nRepost from @qthewakeup\n\u2022\nHere is dramatic footage of a shooting last night in Kenosha. A man with a rifle was guarding an auto dealership when major rioting broke out. He shot and killed someone defending property and was then chawed by a mob. As he was attacked by a man with a skateboard, he shot at least 2 people, and then ran to police with his hands up.\n\nThis video is difficult to watch but IMPORTANT to witness. We can\u2019t turn away from the absolute insanity that is being allowed to occur in our cities. \n\nQ had told us we will be brought to the brink of destruction before the people finally wake up, so I\u2019m expecting things to get dramatically worse before they get better.\n\u2014- \u2014- \u2014- \u2014- \u2014- \u2014- \u2014-\n\n#xposingtruth #savethechildren #saveourchildren #endhumantrafficking #wherearethechildren #pedo #virus #adrenochrome #thegreatawakening #truth #Qanon #Q #WWG1WGA #hoax #pandemic #nomasks #maskoff","NumberOfLikes":14,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1598457781,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 26 18:03:01 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#딸사랑\n\nfather & daughter run🏃\u200D♂️\nhow the pandemic has changed our perception of time😔\nits even difficult to find a place to walk around our homes😥\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#pandemic #corvid19 #일자산 #일자산허브천문공원 #일자산공원","NumberOfLikes":21,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598457780,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 26 18:03:00 CEST 2020","Location":"일자산공원"},{"CaptionText":"\"Hazmat Suits\" from Casting Room Miniatures. #minipainting #miniaturepainting #miniatures #dnd #dungeonsanddragons #hazmat #hazmatsuit #rpg #ttrpg #tabletopgame #tabletop #gaming #creative #creativity #fantasy #eirwen_ripple #pandemic #gaming #hobbies #hobby #paintedminis #paintedminiatures","NumberOfLikes":45,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1598457734,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 26 18:02:14 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"IJS 🤷🏽\u200D♀️ #covid19 #coronavirus #covid_19 #pandemic #school","NumberOfLikes":41,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Samara Renée on August 26, 2020.

Na agenda, os compromissos da manhã: Zoom em São Paulo, Rio e Delaware, Skype em Tóquio, mensagens instantâneas para Porto Alegre e Florianópolis, e-mails para Lisboa, Londres e Belo Horizonte. O relógio já marca 11h27. Não vi a hora passar, mas sinto que o dia mal começou. Instalada no Japão, a 12 fusos de diferença do Brasil, preciso adaptar horários para conseguir conversar com fontes e editores espalhados pelo mundo, graças à tecnologia. A um clique de distância digital, experimentamos novas noções temporais: atravessamos fusos e nos conectamos em tempo real, em diálogos que duram minutos (mas podem parecer intermináveis) ou horas (dissipadas num piscar de olhos). Em tempos de pandemia embalados pela dopamina digital dos apps do momento, os dias estão passando mais rápido do que o dito normal? Ou mais devagar?\nDepende. Na verdade, o tempo está fragmentado. Segundo um estudo liderado pelo acadêmico americano Philip Gable, professor do Departamento de Psicologia e Neurociência da Universidade de Delaware, a pandemia de covid-19 vem provocando impactos diversos nas nossas percepções sobre o tempo. Com apoio financeiro da National Science Foundation, dos Estados Unidos, Gable desenvolveu um aplicativo para documentar impressões e comportamentos dos americanos ao longo da pandemia. A primeira amostra conta com mil participantes de todos os estados americanos, que mês a mês respondem a uma série de questões para o estudo.\n\nLink na bio. \n\nFonte: Revista Gama\n\n#covid19 #coronavirus #ONN #onovonormal #covidart #covid2020, #covid19brasil #covidmask #covidphotodiaries #covidnews #covid19art #corona #coronavírus #coronavirusbrazil #coronaviruspandemic #coronavirusoutbreak #coronavirus2020 #pandemic #pandemicart #pandemic2020, #pandemicorona #pandemiclife #fiqueemcasa #futuro  #homeoffice #emcasa  #usemask #mask #pandemia #revistagama","NumberOfLikes":7,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by O Novo Normal in São Paulo, Brazil.

I\u2019ve woken up with the best of intentions to get things done and to be patient, but by the time 4pm rolls around I\u2019m feeling twitchy, irritable and frustrated. Then I feel guilty. The children go to bed and I feel even worse - I make a promise that tomorrow will be better. I\u2019ll be fun mum again. Then invariably something happens the next day to make me tense up - squeezing my work in the gaps between keeping the children happy and fed. Having three humans here 24\/7 all with very different needs, needing things from me and me only. Housework piling up. Bums to wipe. Knowing I\u2019ve got to launch my Autumn classes but the fear of putting myself out there is mounting. Running behind on what I need to achieve that day. \n\u2063\nI begin to feel a simmering rage at bloody Covid - how much it\u2019s changed things for everyone. The crushing realisation that we have to live with this virus for much longer than originally thought.\u2063 It\u2019s not natural for us to live so deeply in each others\u2019 pockets for months on end. \n\nIt all feels a bit deflating and very frustrating.\u2063\n\u2063\nOn days like this when my spirit is crushed and my temper is rising, I have to remind myself that yes things are hard, it\u2019s OK. We are all finding it hard, whatever our situation. We\u2019ve spent the best part of six months living in a pandemic - adjusting, processing, getting through in whatever way we can. \u2063\n\u2063\nSo however I feel today - it\u2019s OK. It\u2019s the best I can do today, and that\u2019s enough. \u2063\n\u2063\nSometimes just that little bit of tenderness towards myself is enough to bring my simmering down a notch.\u2063\n\u2063\nIf you\u2019re feeling the same this week then virtual hugs to you.

I'm lucky because I have a roof over my head and food to eat and support from people who care about me. But I'm still an out-of-work musician who can't tour and for now can't livestream from home or elsewhere so I'm left with a lot of time to ponder things.\n.\n.\nI think about the arts and their place in society. What they're worth to folx, why they're a part of us, what they say about us. Musicians are often documentarians of the life they observe. I've heard beautiful new albums out this year by artists I love even more for hearing them. I released 2 myself. Music is still being made. I've been writing a song a week all year.\n.\n.\nAnd I've been thinking of the role of the arts in the entertainment industries. For me, they're different things. I create art; I'm not an entertainer. Many performers are both. But being grounded in one place for 8 months after 3 years of extensive touring has given me time to analyze my role in this indie music life and I know without a doubt now, I don't sing to entertain. I sing and play because my voice and my fingers are the vehicles of my art.\n.\n.\nI am a gallery on tour. I want people to come listen to me the way they would come to a gallery - to observe, to be inspired, to be provoked, to ponder, to be made to feel uncomfortable, to feel seen, to feel part of a greater consciousness, to partake in a conversation. Struggling to put my finger on what about bar gigs and jukebox-mentality have never sat right with me for 7 years now and this is it.\n.\n.\n#pandemic #pandemicthoughts #2020 #grounded #limbo #musician #entertainment #artist #gallery #galleryontour #sonicgallery #redefine #reframe #indielife #indiearts","NumberOfLikes":53,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Leslie Hudson on August 26, 2020.

On this session Ms Melia and Ms Maureen have recorded the puppet show before. They shared the gospel by puppet show to make the children more excited to learn and listen to the Gospel. In other hand, Father Ferry Pr from Kei Island told a story about The Hidden paradise (Kei Island) near Ambon. So everyone can plan to visit Kei Island someday.

This volleyball player is without her team and classmates in the fall, as APS has cancelled all their fall sports and in-class lessons. Though Akron Public Schools are remote for the first 9 weeks (minimum) and have cancelled all sports, it appears that Bella is comfortable with that. In our short [follow up photo shoot] time together, Bella helped encourage her younger siblings and her sweet heart shined as she was loving on her family. Clearly a heart for helping others grow, Bella was using all her tricks to make the kids laugh. She was talking about honey with Sam and doing invisible taste tests off the fence at one of their apiaries. \n\n\u2022\n\nFall might look vastly different than what we are used to, but maybe that\u2019s what makes it more special.

My 6 takeaways from an article by @adamgrant in the @theeconomist (link in bio) on how Covid-19 could change the way we work. \u2060\n\u2060\n1, We will be more grateful for the work we have. Gratefulness -> happiness. Therefore people would be happier at work.\u2060\nCounterpoint: Bosses may take advantage of people who value their work. Ever heard of \"passion tax\"?\u2060\n\u2060\n2, \"People-first\" approach wins in the long term. People notice when companies care, they will stay more loyal after the crisis.\u2060\n\u2060\n3, Ethical leadership will prevail. We could end up with Japanese model of protecting jobs or Scandinavian model of providing a safety- net for those who lose their jobs.\u2060\n\u2060\n4, We will see a renaissance of guilds: groups that share occupational skills. Could be employee-owned or structured as partnerships with job security and benefits.\u2060\n\u2060\n5, Trust - we will see polarization of trust. Either it is complete trust or complete distrust. The middle way is unlikely.\u2060\n\u2060\n6, Best for the last - Would we see a change in working hours? Perhaps we would finally align working hours with school hours. What would be the implications on traffic patterns? Grant advocates less hours in general. Task ahead would be to make the fewer hours count.\u2060","NumberOfLikes":7,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Surya Ramkumar on August 26, 2020 tagging @adamgrant.

Hailing from Tuli in Mokokchung district, he wanted to find a way to be self sufficient by using resources available. He paints and draws, but never really thought of enterprising on his artworks. However when Nagaland was announced as a plastic free state, an idea struck him. Climate change is already a pressing concern, an issue he took very seriously. Therefore as the state takes this important pledge, he found a way to contribute. What better way to do so, than threading on sustainable lifestyle and encouraging the same. He bought few cloth bags from a friend which he customized by painting on them.  These bags were then sold through his personal Instagram account (@tim_yanger ). Though he was initially nervous about this venture, the support he received pushed him. \u201CIt is important to represent your products with longevity and sustainable quality,\u201D says Mr Yanger. Apart from hand painted cloth bags (tote bags), he also sell paintings on canvas. He follows a colourful palette with minimalistic design. \u201CI draw inspiration from everyday domestic use, something that is organic, patterns, faces and also sunsets which always turn out quirky yet pleasing.\u201D His works are mostly original, but he also takes requests from customers for any particular design. He has flair of designing them in a way it carries his artistic identity. An example being his customers\u2019 highest demand- Van Gogh\u2019s Cypress Tree, which also carries his own touch. As an artist, he creates and as an entrepreneur, he sells. Mr Yanger mentions his utmost passion which is driven by the fact that though the product follows a transaction, each artwork is a piece of memory that is being transferred. \u201CArtists I look up to would always be Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso. Whenever I feel unmotivated, I just go through their work because they create such complex pieces through simple marks\u201D, he added. \n\n#nagaland","NumberOfLikes":239,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":21,"Timestamp":1598439459,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 26 12:57:39 CEST 2020","Location":"Mokokchung"},{"CaptionText":"The new thing will begin with you letting go of the old ones.

There is a huge economic inequality, so if we can, we must attempt to spread the wealth through charity. The pandemic caused a lot of burden in the middle and lower class. People are getting sick and a lot are losing their jobs and businesses. It is a crucial time that calls for \"bayanihan\". What seems small for you may be the cost of survival for others. That's why I am all for giving instead of lending.\n\nI had a bad experience with lending. The person I lend money to, kept on dodging me even if I am not asking for the money back. Our relationship became awkward and confusing. She was ashamed, and I was frustrated because I don't want our relationship to change. \n\nEver since then, I use a different approach to lending. I either give what I can afford to lose, help them find opportunities to earn, or set clear and specific expectations early on. It really depends on the reason, the amount they need vs the amount I can lend, and the urgency of borrowing. This enable me to maintain relationships and help at the same time.\n\nDo you lend money to family and friends?\nShare us some tips!

For both the TB and COVID tests, swabs are collected using the same manner. As per the proposal, people who show symptoms of TB, such as coughing, chest pain and fever, as well as those who are in contact with TB patients, and diabetics at high risk of developing TB will be tested.\n\nSaid Dr Sunil Kumar M, an officer in the state TB cell: \u201CThe state\u2019s TB elimination programme has, for the last two months, been hampered by the pandemic. Now, we are utilising even the COVID platform to detect TB.\u201D The estimated annual risk of infection in the state is only one-fifth of national estimates. The System for TB Elimination in Private sector (STEPS) has suggested that the plan be implemented countrywide.\n\nSince 2019, Kerala has been on the forefront of recognising latent TB infection, and its management.

Teaching children during this period is not easy, because all the students\u2019 homes are far apart from one another.\n\nAs a teacher, I have to be able to continue educating all students, even in difficult times like now! Every day, I prepare and distribute learning materials to each student\u2019s house. For teaching elementary school students, I\u2019m assisted by our local tutors to provide daily learning materials which we give to our students in hard copy, prepared by EBPP teachers in their respective fields of study. The learning system we use is to gather several students whose houses are reasonably close together, then the tutor immediately explains the lesson with questions and answers. Sometimes though, it\u2019s a little difficult for students whose homes are far apart to gather with their friends who live far away and they could only access on steep roads - on foot! For those situations, the tutors and I have to come to their houses, so they can all follow all subject lessons.\n\nFor junior and senior high school levels, they study mainly online using WhatsApp texting with a predetermined schedule. In teaching online lessons, sometimes I have difficulties too, because the internet signal in our area is hard to find.\n\nThis does not reduce my enthusiasm for doing my duties as a teacher, because all students need their teacher\u2019s guidance.\n\nIn the midst of this difficult situation, I feel grateful because I\u2019m still able to do my job, and can help each student to share knowledge - and always hope that what I am doing right now is useful for EBPP students.\n\nI also thank the donors who have helped. I hope that the coronavirus pandemic will pass quickly so that the situation returns to normal and I can return to teaching our students face-to-face at school.","NumberOfLikes":9,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598429408,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 26 10:10:08 CEST 2020","Location":"Ban, Kubu, Karangasem"},{"CaptionText":"1 week countdown to Shenzhen #LEDChina2020!

Bagi kalian yang ikut terdampak, semangat ya, ini bisa dibilang bencana yang buruk tapi di sisi lain saya melihat ini merupakan cara Tuhan menegur kita untuk lebih bersyukur atas semua yang kita punya saat ini, terutama hidup yang diberikan-Nya. Bagi yang tidak merasakan apa-apa, kalian patut lebih bersyukur lagi. Di saat semua merasakannya, kalian bisa duduk diam di rumah dengan keluarga tanpa harus pusing ini itu.\nPandemi ini memberi kita pelajaran bahwa manusia tidak hebat. Sebanyak apapun uang, kekuasaan dan kekuatan yang kita miliki, kita tidak bisa menghentikannya dengan cepat. \nBagi yang membaca  atau sekedar like tanpa baca, terima kasih sudah meluangkan waktunya.

How we forget names but never faces. How we fly with 27920 crew in a single month ( sometimes never repeating for months ) and still crack up to every single one in the galley. How we still smile when you order a black coffee and then ask for creamers and sugar (still smiling oho). How fathers hug their daughters at the arrival gate. How lovers meet and get teary. How to use an oxygen bottle on someone. How to fight fire. How to evacuate the entire flight in 90 (NINETY!!!) seconds. How to borrow pens and never give them back. How to EXPLORE on a short 9 hour layover. How to smile when you're behind the mask. How to help wholeheartely with your PPE. How to stand in the aisle LIKE YOU OWN IT. How to continue singing a song stuck in your head while serving a cuppa.  How to wake up and not know where you are, what time it is. How to know your staff by recognising the back of their heads.
