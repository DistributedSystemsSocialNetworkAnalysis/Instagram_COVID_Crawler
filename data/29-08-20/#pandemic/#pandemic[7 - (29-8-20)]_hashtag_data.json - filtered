I thought about. \n\nSome of my friends know that I am not doing okay. Away from home, less money, no friends, no cats and sometimes no food.\n\n10 days - work days, no sleep, weird sleep, bad days, sad days, and extremely sad days. Absolutely no breaks. Ofcourse there are good days as well and extremely good days as well. \n\nThis has been the loneliest phase of the pandemic. You know the time, in captive punishment, you resort to journal and write things. This may be my captive punishment.\n\nMy preoccupation has not allowed my be there for my closest friends and vice versa. And the ones that I reach out are are digitalalized binary waveforms transmitted through different hubs. No one in vicinity. \n\nSo I started looking at old pictures of family and friends. My home, roads, family, cats, flowers, you get the drift. \nAnd then these defining moments. \n\nPictures of my first car, that swimming certificate, the bucketlist cross-outs. \n\nI think my drive comes from my grandmother, more importantly this letter that papa wrote for Dadi. Papa was 7, chacha was 9 months old. Dadi left them to dada and her a sister to pursue her masters. Oh, she prepared well.\n\nI am sure she was called selfish, I am sure she was mocked upon and made fun of  50 years ago. She would have to go through that today. But she didn't care, she was singleton like that. \n\nLook at the impeccable writing by a 7 year old and the fact that my father calls himself 'sun' (#punny ). \n\nThe thing is I am never going be okay. There is no normal, it's just a mindset. I don't know what else to do apart from keeping my engine afloat, I am singleton that way. \n\nThe truth is I not am doing okay.\n\nSo if you see me say #thistooshallpass and I will pray for you. And pray for me  and say that the world will get better and we will only drive past our limitations. \n\nP.S. this is my grandmothers death anniversary week and I am coming to realize that at one point of time she defined my life.\n\n#wednesdaymotivation #dadi #papa #letter #drive #passion #okaynottobeokay #oldletters #50yearsago #papasays #pandemic #goodtimes #badtimes #anxiety #longtimeago #determination #perserverance","NumberOfLikes":26,"Hashtags":["#punny","#thistooshallpass","#wednesdaymotivation","#dadi","#papa","#letter","#drive","#passion","#okaynottobeokay","#oldletters","#50yearsago","#papasays","#pandemic","#goodtimes","#badtimes","#anxiety","#longtimeago","#determination","#perserverance"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by nida sahar on August 25, 2020.

The accomplishment comes with Nigeria, formerly one of three countries still dealing with polio, having been declared polio-free. The only remaining countries dealing with polio now are Afghanistan and Pakistan. However, a rare vaccine-derived polio does remain a danger in Africa with 177 cases having been identified this year. Identified in countries like Nigeria and Angola, this form of the virus mutates from the oral polio vaccine and may spread into under-immunized communities. It will take longer to eliminate this form.\n\nAlthough polio has been eradicated in all but two countries now, the World Health Organization has stressed that it can easily return via imported cases. An example of this is Angola, a country that defeated polio in 2001 only to have it return in 2005 after cases were brought into the country from outside its borders. The WHO has warned countries to continue remaining vigilant and avoid complacency. \n\n#propergaanda #polio #africa #polioeradication #nigeria #angola #pakistan #disease #pandemic","NumberOfLikes":1885,"Hashtags":["#propergaanda","#polio","#africa","#polioeradication","#nigeria","#angola","#pakistan","#disease","#pandemic"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ProperGaanda on August 25, 2020.

Of course. So why didn\u2019t he? Because the goal is #blackgenocide.\n*\nWe blacks are the ones being killed by the cops \u2014 and by the #pandemic as the health care system in most countries benefit the ones with more access to essential services (whites). We\u2019re the ones living in poorer conditions, with less access to education and low paid jobs.\n*\nThen, you might say, \u201CYou\u2019ve always had good jobs + high-quality education, attended expensive schools, lived in comfortable houses in good neighborhoods. What are YOU talking about?\u201D\n*\nWhites like using exceptions to justify racist ideas. Most black women in Brazil, where I come from, live in the favelas, have basic or no education, and the only way to earn income is to clean white people\u2019s houses.\n*\nThat wouldn\u2019t be a problem if they wanted to clean houses. Most black women raise their kids alone \u2014 if their kids are not shot by the cops. I\u2019M THE EXCEPTION.\n*\nWhites have historically tried to keep us on the other side of the line. \u201COver that line, I see...beautiful white women with their arms stretched out to me...I can't seem to get over that line...The only thing that separates women of colour from anyone else is opportunity,\u201D said @ViolaDavis when she won the Emmy.\n*\nDo you know when we tend to be most respected by whites? When we\u2019re artists or athletes because white people enjoy being entertained. But #blackpeople as the boss, in the family, in the academia? Hell no!\n*\nWhites don\u2019t like being questioned or \u201Ceducated\u201D by us. They feel uncomfortable. As they feel superior, if we question them, they realize they\u2019re not better than us \u2014 and it hurts because of #whitefragility. Whites don\u2019t like being in the position they always wanted us to be.\n*\nTHIS is #systemicracism. If you don\u2019t do anything to change the status quo, you\u2019re not only guilty.

Hal ini menjadi tantangan untuk para pelaku usaha yang berbasis offline.\n\n\"Sekarang ini apa sih yang terjadi saat Corona?¬†Market behavior¬†bergeser, orang jadi diam di rumah. Bayangkan saja mal jadi sepi, bioskop jadi kosong, kafe jadi sepi,\" kata dia dalam acara d'mentor di¬†detikcom, Selasa (23\/6\/2020).\n\nDengan lebih banyaknya orang yang berdiam diri di rumah, maka orang yang berpenghasilan secara harian pasti akan sangat terdampak. Untuk itu, dia menjelaskan ada beberapa solusi yang bisa dilakukan agar bisa tetap menjalankan usaha di tengah pandemi. Misalnya jangan mengerjakan sektor yang butuh waktu dan tenaga banyak untuk produksi seperti di bidang fesyen.\n\nDia menyarankan agar bisa mencoba dengan menjadi reseller yang modalnya bisa dimulai dari Rp 500 ribu.\n\"Bisa jadi dropship dulu kan kita ngejualin barang orang dulu. Kita cari ilmunya kita pelajari dulu,\" ujar dia.\n\n\"Kalau modal berani doang terus rugi bagaimana? Nah makanya jangan usaha yang ada risiko produksinya dulu, mending jualan produk orang lain dulu ilmunya diambil, contohnya begini, iklan begini,\" ujarnya.\n\nSumber :https:\/\/m.detik.com\/finance\/berita-ekonomi-bisnis\/d-5067106\/kiat-moncer-bisnis-jualan-online-saat-pandemi-corona\/1\n\n#pandemic\n#corona\n#covid19\n#bisnisonline\n#dropshipper\n#apphelp\n#antarpaketmurah\n#tarifmurah\n#ojolkmurah\n#ojollangganan\n#lawancorona\n#tetapusaha","NumberOfLikes":4,"Hashtags":["#pandemic","#corona","#covid19","#bisnisonline","#dropshipper","#apphelp","#antarpaketmurah","#tarifmurah","#ojolkmurah","#ojollangganan","#lawancorona","#tetapusaha"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by apphelp on August 25, 2020 tagging @ayik_kampoengbikersjacob, @ivanyudhistiro, @r1ckywp, and @andrewariskyputra.

The unexpected close of schools in March was bittersweet for her as she had an unexpected and incomplete goodbye to students, but was able to enjoy more time with her daughters. She shared her experience of the ups and downs of pandemic parenting with us.\n\nAndi writes:\n\nWhen the world is always go, go, go, having a global pandemic to slow things down isn\u2019t ideal but I was grateful. Being a mom of an infant and toddler during these times was equally joyful and exhausting. \n\nI was able to see more of the development of my 4 month old to an almost 10 month old. \n\nMy husband was actually home without a sporting event to attend and our sassy three year old got to see him more than she ever had before. \n\nWhat I wasn\u2019t prepared for was the talks about where her friends went, why she couldn\u2019t see them, and why the stores didn\u2019t let us in. I was blown away by how much someone as young as three missed and verbalized the need for socialization with someone her own age. \n\nIt has made me appreciate how schools and daycares foster learning and a care for others outside of our home. \n\nYou\u2019d think my house would be super clean and I\u2019d cook dinner every night, but honestly, we choose to make memories and hustle when we need to. \n\nWe\u2019ve made it and I\u2019m forever grateful for the cherished time at home with my little family. \n\n#pandemic #pandemicparenting #momlife #momoftwo #girlmom #daughters #sisters #blackandwhite #parenting #educator #teachers #teachersofinstagram #teachersfollowteachers #teacherlife #teacherandstudent #mask #masklife #educatorsofinstagram #scienceteacher #scienceteachers #inspire #millennial #millennialsmakingit","NumberOfLikes":11,"Hashtags":["#pandemic","#pandemicparenting","#momlife","#momoftwo","#girlmom","#daughters","#sisters","#blackandwhite","#parenting","#educator","#teachers","#teachersofinstagram","#teachersfollowteachers","#teacherlife","#teacherandstudent","#mask","#masklife","#educatorsofinstagram","#scienceteacher","#scienceteachers","#inspire","#millennial","#millennialsmakingit"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598404374,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 26 03:12:54 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Nightly make out session.\n.\n#pitbull #staffy #staffygram #pittbullsofinstagram #dogsofinsta #pandemic #dontbullymybreed  #adoptdontshop #adventureswithdogs #dog #doglife #americanbully","NumberOfLikes":24,"Hashtags":["#pitbull","#staffy","#staffygram","#pittbullsofinstagram","#dogsofinsta","#pandemic","#dontbullymybreed","#adoptdontshop","#adventureswithdogs","#dog","#doglife","#americanbully"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1598404362,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 26 03:12:42 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"New Mask $14.99 from @theinspirationalmaskstore get yours today link in bio\n.\n.\n#mask #covid #facemask #masks #coronavirus #skincare #art #masker #corona #staysafe #stayhome #beauty #fashion #love #quarantine #handmade #n #makeup #maskerwajah #photography #socialdistancing #like #virus #cosplay #instagram #instagood #pandemic #follow #m #bhfyp","NumberOfLikes":1,"Hashtags":["#mask","#covid","#facemask","#masks","#coronavirus","#skincare","#art","#masker","#corona","#staysafe","#stayhome","#beauty","#fashion","#love","#quarantine","#handmade","#n","#makeup","#maskerwajah","#photography","#socialdistancing","#like","#virus","#cosplay","#instagram","#instagood","#pandemic","#follow","#m","#bhfyp"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The Inspirational Mask Store on August 25, 2020.

I\u2019m definitely an introvert, and I spent the last 5 1\/2 years of my life extremely busy with my career, so I had really been enjoying my time home with Jack and taking in the beautiful, quiet Vermont country lifestyle up until this point. \n\nNow I\u2019m craving some sense of normalcy, whatever the new normal is going to look like. I want to go places and do things and see people. Mostly, I want to develop our own community here like we had back in Massachusetts, which is nearly impossible during a pandemic. \n\nLuckily, I have great friends, family, and a husband to talk to, a great creative outlet in my blog, and the cutest baby in the world who brightens even the darkest days. \n\nI\u2019ve said this from the beginning of the pandemic, but I love watching Jack still lead a life as close to the normal he would have had. While there are no play dates or errands or trips out anywhere, he is still meeting all of his milestones, learning new things every day, and making us smile more than we ever knew possible. \n\nHow are you doing? Like how are you actually doing? Today was better than yesterday for me.

To ask ourselves, what are things that are really important in our lives and why?\n\nFor me I've learned that I need to slow down every once in a while and that it's okay to be by myself.\n\nI've learned just how important staying connected with friends and family is for my sanity and, that I can make do without a lot of what I thought was necessary. There is so much more but I\u2019d love to hear from you. \n\nIn a time when our worlds can feel stripped of familiarity and joy, we also have the ability to reinvest meaning into it and to discover what it really is that makes us tick.\n\nWhat is one thing that you have realized during this pandemic?

Neighboring Argentina is \"burning out of control\" as a result of cattle ranchers burning grasslands to create new pasture.

I met a gentleman named Jacob B. who generously donated his time and 3D printer to make the visor portions of face shields. He was looking for someone with a laser cutter to make the face shield parts so he can assemble and deliver the final face shields to hospitals. The rest was history.\n\nOne day later, I shipped the laser cut PETG face shields to Jacob. Jacob assembled them and delivered them to hospitals.\n\nAll of this started from a simple question, how can I help? \n\nSo, how can I help? What are you helping with? Let me know in the comments section.\n\n#glowforge #glowforgemade #glowforgecreations #lasercutter #lasercutting #lasercut #lasercutacrylic #faceshield #faceshields #faceshieldcovid19 #essentialmedicalsupplies #designingforhumanity #designforhumanity #covid19 #covid #covid_19 #pandemic #pandemic2020 #essentialworker #helpothers #helpessentialworkers #protectmedicalprofessionals #designforgood #ungstudio #makersgonnamake #makersmovement #makerscovidresponse #makerscovid19","NumberOfLikes":30,"Hashtags":["#glowforge","#glowforgemade","#glowforgecreations","#lasercutter","#lasercutting","#lasercut","#lasercutacrylic","#faceshield","#faceshields","#faceshieldcovid19","#essentialmedicalsupplies","#designingforhumanity","#designforhumanity","#covid19","#covid","#covid_19","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#essentialworker","#helpothers","#helpessentialworkers","#protectmedicalprofessionals","#designforgood","#ungstudio","#makersgonnamake","#makersmovement","#makerscovidresponse","#makerscovid19"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":7,"Timestamp":1598392807,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 26 00:00:07 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"High taper fade \n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n#Barber #barbershop #brampton #melanin #pandemic #quarantine #barberlife #barberlifestyle #barberpost #barbergrind #barbergang #barbers #hair #bramptonbarbers #lineup #crisplines #freshcut #canada #hightaperfade #taperfade #fadehaircut #cutjunkies #hairstyles #haircut #wahl #babyliss #andis","NumberOfLikes":11,"Hashtags":["#Barber","#barbershop","#brampton","#melanin","#pandemic","#quarantine","#barberlife","#barberlifestyle","#barberpost","#barbergrind","#barbergang","#barbers","#hair","#bramptonbarbers","#lineup","#crisplines","#freshcut","#canada","#hightaperfade","#taperfade","#fadehaircut","#cutjunkies","#hairstyles","#haircut","#wahl","#babyliss","#andis"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598392602,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 23:56:42 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"What college in 2020 looks like my two girls @adiatroy @emiholmess #2020 #collegebound #educatedwomen #holmesgirls #mypacemakerbaby #life #pandemic #italiangirlüáÆüáπ","NumberOfLikes":15,"Hashtags":["#2020","#collegebound","#educatedwomen","#holmesgirls","#mypacemakerbaby","#life","#pandemic","#italiangirlüáÆüáπ"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598392597,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 23:56:37 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"He further said, \"The coronavirus pandemic will define this era. \"\n.\nFollow us for more @tradewithstatistics\n.\n.\n.\n#tws\n#businessnews #indiannews \n#billgates #billgatesnews  #microsoft  #lockdown #coronavirus #covid19\n#pandemic #coronaviruspandemic","NumberOfLikes":38,"Hashtags":["#tws","#businessnews","#indiannews","#billgates","#billgatesnews","#microsoft","#lockdown","#coronavirus","#covid19","#pandemic","#coronaviruspandemic"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by TWS ‚Ñ¢ Stock Investing Trading in Nashik ‡§®‡§æ‡§∂‡§ø‡§ï Maharashtra.

Our culture is so focused on \u201Cdoing\u201D and \u201Cgetting things done\u201D that the value of taking a pause is often questioned. But how can we expect ourselves to constantly be \u201Con\u201D without recharging? We don\u2019t expect this of our electronics (hello 10% battery remaining warnings!) so it truly makes no sense to expect this of ourselves.\n\nSomething that came up in a therapy session today was the concept of being in alignment - my client and I noted that when her mind and body can align around her needs (getting up early to go for a walk vs. sleeping in due to fatigue) it\u2019s much simpler for her to take care of herself in the way she actually needs, as compared to harsh or unrealistic expectations (I\u2019ll get up everyday at 6am no matter what). But until she was able to slow down, she couldn\u2019t pay attention enough to align. \n\nLet\u2019s be clear: sometimes rigor and discipline are needed, or sometimes we simply have no choice (eg. getting up at 6am every day to train for a marathon or to go to work). But in situations where we do have a choice, paying attention to our needs is much more accessible in the slow moments, when we allow ourselves to reset. All the more during this COVID pandemic, in a time of constant uncertainty, where our needs may differ from day to day.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget about the pandemic of hate and racism that we get constant reminders of too. In the wake of yet another brutal police shooting, moments of rest and recharge are critical to maintaining enough internal resources to keep doing the work of coping with - and changing - systems of injustice. Burnout causes us to check out, and this is not a time we can afford to check out. But that\u2019s only possible if we allow ourselves to take a pause when it\u2019s most needed.\n\nSlow moments are crucial when we are feeling emotionally and physically taxed, and despite every message we hear around \u201Cproductivity\u201D and \u201Cdoing\u201D, don\u2019t forget that rest is productive too.","NumberOfLikes":19,"Hashtags":["#TuesdayTip"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Dr. Gauri Saxena on August 25, 2020.

In times of crisis, this can be lifesaving if sterilization of bottles was not available.\nü¶† Lastly, but possibly most importantly, breastmilk changes to meet the needs of your baby or toddler! Your breastmilk responds to your environment by creating antibodies to fight any unwanted bacteria or viruses. By kissing, smelling, and nibbling on your baby, you are taking in their environment and creating antibodies to fight anything that your little one may be fighting. Your breastmilk will then contain the antibodies that your baby will benefit from!\n‚ú®Breastmilk really is an amazing substance! It\u2019s not magic, it\u2019s science! üí™\n\nü¶†Did you find that your baby didn\u2019t get sick much while you were breastfeeding?\n‚ú®Were you able to feel the effects of those hormone releases??\nüëá Tell us about it in the comments üëá\n‚ú®Sign up for our breastfeeding class this Thursday to learn more!‚ú®\n@breezybirthcentralvalley \n#breastfeeding #breastmilkmagic #covid_19 #pandemic #2020 #breastmilk #parenting","NumberOfLikes":12,"Hashtags":["#breastfeeding","#breastmilkmagic","#covid_19","#pandemic","#2020","#breastmilk","#parenting"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Emily Garcia on August 25, 2020.

As a society, we have become an AC-obsessed culture. And don\u2019t get me wrong, I love my new suburban central AC setup. But the experience of sitting on a patio, sidewalk or vista, sessioning an aperitif and hoping for the whiff of a faint breeze to cool you off felt like an experience only culturally underlined in places like Rome, Paris and Barcelona.\n.\nIt has been such an inspiring show of resolve for the hospitality industry and such a revelation to see these experiences come en masse to our shores. For outside dining to no longer be the overflow option for the braver late-comers on a muggy summer evening but for the elevated al fresco experience to be the new arms race to differentiate your venue. It\u2019s no longer the \u201Csmoking section\u201D equivalent for the sweat-tolerant. Whatever this new normal looks like, I hope this trend has a lasting impact, and that my first instinct will no longer be to cram into a dimly lit cocktail corner instead of enjoying some glorious summer twilight.\n.\nMasks on.

It would be lovely if you could subscribe, please ü•∞. Link in bio.\nEveryone has had a different experience throughout this pandemic. Some experiences will be relatable to others. Of course, I am aware that people have lost there loved ones because of this virus and that is so painful. We all FEEL different emotions because we all have different experiences throughout life and that is ok. Yes, we can put things in perspective, but we should never feel guilty for how we FEEL. For example, My Grandad passed away in January then 2 months later my Granny had to isolate for so many weeks on her own. I can\u2019t relate to that, but I\u2019m able to understand that would have been very difficult for her. I can\u2019t relate to all the long hours the NHS staff would have had to work to help the patients, but I\u2019m able to appreciate and acknowledge them for all their hard work ‚ú®.\nI, however, have had so many changes throughout this lockdown. My relationship ended, I lost my job because I had to move from London to Newcastle in the height of the pandemic in April. Bearing in mind I had just made all these new changes in December to leave a job in the NHS up north so I could move to London and commit to my relationship. Anyways that was my story I kept on telling myself, but it\u2019s not anymore as I have had to change my mindset instead of being my own self-pity party. It takes me a while to get used to change and settle into things, therefore I have struggled with all these changes again. Although I\u2019m not the type of person to adapt to change quickly I don\u2019t ever want this to put me off from making other big changes in my life again. Change = Growth üíõ\nMy mental health has struggled a little bit in lockdown and I know I won\u2019t be the only one. I haven\u2019t felt depressed, but I have felt very sad and frustrated some days. I know this has to do with my situation, but others might have felt anxious\/depressed because they have been alone in this or maybe they have just had so much fear with the way the world is.

But we\u2019re back and better than ever.\n\nSince the outbreak of the coronavirus, more than 40 million U.S. workers have filed for unemployment. We feel and understand the collective concern surrounding layoffs and the impression it may leave on a hiring manager, but we are here to assure you that your situation will not catch hiring managers by surprise. They are fully aware that millions of Americans have been laid off, many by no fault of their own.\n\nSo, don\u2019t be consumed with worry. Your layoff had nothing to do with your performance, and they know that. Instead, pray, stay calm, keep your focus on the future, and be optimistic. The right job is on its way to you. \n\nGod bless you!

The don\u2019t just drive buses. At their discretion, they give homeless people somewhere warm to sleep. They provide security for night shift workers against people who have had too much to drink and are acting aggressively. I have seen bus drivers stop buses and get out of their seat to help older people on and off the bus, to intervene when women are sexually harassed, to sit down with their phone and help people who are lost get home when the other passengers don\u2019t care enough to help. .\n\nIn April 2020, TFL\u2019s director of bus operations, Claire Mann stated her devastation at the deaths of TFL employees But then she said the \u201Cvery latest scientific advice\u201D was that PPE was \u201Cnot required in non-care settings and could be counter-productive.\u201D In my opinion I lay the blame of TFL employees squarely at their employers feet. .\n\nDuring June 2020, when pandemic lockdown restrictions were easing I started looking for a new job and taking buses again with the knowledge of at least 23 London Bus drivers had died due to contracting Covid-19. I was pleased to see that bus drivers had finally been given protection. .\n\nAlso by this time it was made compulsory for passengers to wear face masks on public transport and I witnessed a new set of challenges for bus drivers. They are now left solely responsible for enforcing masks on the buses and also refusing passengers when the bus is full. Whilst doing this, I\u2019ve witnessed horrific verbal abuse from people who are challenged by the drivers on not wearing masks. This abuse has extended to racist slurs and ever banging on the barrier and kicking the drivers door. I have been disgusted by the reaction of the general public towards the men and women who are providing a key service. .\n\nIs standing outside and clapping once a week your maximum capacity to care? .\n\nThis series is dedicated to Mervyn Mally Kennedy. .\n\n#transportforlondon #tfl #covid19 #pandemic #lockdown #lockdownlondon #pandemic2020 #mervynmallykennedy #londonbusdrivers  #lockdownlife #f","NumberOfLikes":24,"Hashtags":["#Repost","#transportforlondon","#tfl","#covid19","#pandemic","#lockdown","#lockdownlondon","#pandemic2020","#mervynmallykennedy","#londonbusdrivers","#lockdownlife","#f"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by FIXPHOTO on August 25, 2020.

More than one in five US adults, 22% of the population, has relocated or knows someone likely to do so as a consequence of Covid-19\u2019s socioeconomic impact, according to a recent study. Silicon Valley companies like Google, Facebook, Twitter and others have sent their employees to work from home, making their physical¬†proximity to the workplace irrelevant. High rents and safety concerns are the main reasons for considering relocation in many communities, marking a trend to abandon the city for rural areas. Does this indicate a step backward? No, simple life is moving forward.\n\nMobility is a US characteristic. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, on average, Americans change their place of residence no less than 11 times during their lives, mainly pursuing better job opportunities. But relocation due to the pandemic has a peculiar characteristic\u2014it is a true move back to basics. Residents in urban areas are increasingly abandoning the stressful and expensive big cities to settle in the quiet and pastoral countryside, a noticeable trend in America and Europe.\n\nDecades ago, people flocked from farms and villages to the big cities expecting to fulfill their dreams of progress and upward mobility. Today, businesses are closing and those still employed are changing their work patterns from activities in the physical workplace to remote engagement. So, what now is the benefit of living in the urban areas? None. The pandemic is transforming our lifestyle for good. We will realize more and more how adapting to a more virtual environment is a positive thing.\n\nWhen the population is more scattered and evenly dispersed, everyone benefits\u2014the ecology and humans. Conversely, overcrowded, high-density cities add stress to surrounding environments and pose challenges in the efficient use of natural resources such as water, energy, and food. On the personal level, life outside the urban areas is more manageable, affordable, and healthy.","NumberOfLikes":92,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Kabbalist Dr. Michael Laitman on August 25, 2020.

The NBA Playoffs are ongoing and some players have shined while others have struggled mightily,¬†including the one we're covering today: Paul George!\n*\nTHE STATS: 15.3 PPG  22% 3PT%  29% FG%  4 PFPG  YEAR 1960\n*\nFor this post, traditional numbers are enough to highlight how bad PG13 has been so far in the 1st round series against the Mavericks. He's shooting a putrid 29% from the floor, including an abysmal 22% from behind the 3-point line. In 4 games, he's averaging 15.3 ppg (a number actually inflated by his 27-point effort in Game 1 - he scored 14, 11, and 9 points in Games 2, 3, and 4, respectively).\n*\nThe last 3 games have been particularly brutal for PG: he made only 10 of his 47 field goal attempts (21.3% on average). He's the first player since 1960 and Celtics great Bob Cousy to shoot under 25% from the floor in 3 straight playoff games (minimum 10 attempts in each game)! To make things worse, he's been subpar¬†on defense too, often getting burnt by Mavs opponents. In the current series against Dallas, his defense has been like bubble gum: soft. He has also committed 4 fouls per game (four in each game).\n*\nThe Los Angeles Clippers haven't looked amazing since the restart of the season in the NBA bubble in Florida, and Paul George has now been given the nickname \"Pandemic P\" by NBA fans due to his poor play up until now. However, when at the top of his game,¬†@ygtrece is an elite two-way player - one of the main reasons why the Clippers are thought of as a championship contender by many (including us). But the question is: will he finally be \"Playoff P\" going forward, starting with tonight's Game 5?\n*\nHave you been surprised by Paul George's poor performance so far against Dallas? Will he finally get his groove on and bounce back in the remainder of the series? Will Dallas upset the Clippers?

Living in the US, I\u2019ve essentially been at home since March and there\u2019s no end in near sight. 2020 has been a strange and scary year, but in order to stay sane, I\u2019ve taken up journaling to be able to pen down my thoughts and anxieties. Mental health and wellness has deteriorated in the US this year, with over 53% of Americans reporting that they have felt increased worry and stress. \n\nFor me, journaling has become a key way to deal with such worries. By keeping a daily log for all the thoughts I experience during the day, I am able to dump the cognitive load that builds up in my mind onto a piece of paper. I can free my mind from these thoughts, which allows me to focus more on the present. While I journal, I tend to ask myself important questions, while allows me to identify the sources of stress of in my life and make meaningful discoveries. It also feels therapeutic to have a place where you can just write and let it all out unfiltered - where you won\u2019t get judged for the way you feel.\n\nJournaling has numerous benefits, and if you\u2019re feeling stressed or anxious in general or about the current state of the world (since we\u2019re in the midst of a global pandemic, US elections, environmental crisis), journaling might be a good way to deal with your thoughts and emotions!

If soap and water are not available, they can use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.\nHowever, swallowing just a tiny amount of hand sanitizer can cause alcohol¬†poisoning in children. Many hand sanitizers are made with alcohol or rubbing alcohol (ethanol, ethyl alcohol, or isopropanol, isopropyl alcohol). Alcohol poisoning symptoms include sleepiness, low blood sugar, seizures and coma, and it can be fatal.\nChildren and adults also have been poisoned after using hand sanitizer that contained¬†methanol \u200B(also called wood alcohol, methyl alcohol, or methylated spirits). It should not be used in hand sanitizer, and these products were recently¬†recalled. Methanol is toxic if swallowed or after repeated use on skin. It may cause nausea, vomiting, headache, blurred vision, blindness, seizures, coma, permanent damage to the nervous system, or death.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics urges parents to keep hand sanitizers out of children's reach.¬†Don't forget about travel-size bottles of sanitizer in purses, diaper bags, backpacks and cars. Parents and caregivers also should supervise children ages 5 and younger when they use hand sanitizer.\n\nHand sanitizer & COVI\u200B\u200BD-19\n\nAs families began buying more hand sanitizer during the COVID-19 pandemic, the National Poison Data System started getting more reports of unintentional exposures in children. In the first half of 2020, there have been 46% more¬†reported cases about hand sanitizer¬†than during the same time last year. Many reports were about children ages 5 years and younger.\nHealth experts recommend using hand sanitizer that is 60% to 95% alcohol to kill the virus that causes COVID-19. \n\nText extracted from: https:\/\/www.healthychildren.org\/English\n\n#safetyfirst #mnfrsafe #handsanitizer #madeinusa #ppe #ppesupplies #protection #besafe #beready #medicalsupplies #gelsanitizer #covid #coronavirus #safety #mask #facemask #staysafe #stayhome #socialdistancing #pandemic #quarantine #gelcare #health #firstaidkit #medicalkit #love","NumberOfLikes":8,"Hashtags":["#safetyfirst","#mnfrsafe","#handsanitizer","#madeinusa","#ppe","#ppesupplies","#protection","#besafe","#beready","#medicalsupplies","#gelsanitizer","#covid","#coronavirus","#safety","#mask","#facemask","#staysafe","#stayhome","#socialdistancing","#pandemic","#quarantine","#gelcare","#health","#firstaidkit","#medicalkit","#love"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598375704,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 19:15:04 CEST 2020","Location":"MIAMI florida \/ EE.UU"},{"CaptionText":"Africa is set to announce that it has stamped out wild poliovirus after a three-decade campaign against a disease that once paralyzed 75,000 children on the continent every year.\n\nThe achievement is a major step toward ridding the globe of the virus that causes the disabling \u2014 and sometimes deadly \u2014 disease of polio: Only Afghanistan and Pakistan are still reporting cases.\n\nThe polio-free certification applies to what the World Health Organization calls the Africa region \u2014 one of its six global zones of operation \u2014 and it excludes North Africa.
