Wer mit seiner Biochemie nicht richtig umgehen kann und immer wieder Fehler macht, muss sich kaum dar√ºber wundern, dass der gesamte Organismus darauf dann irgendwann negativ reagiert. Allerdings dauert das so seine Zeit. Und oft ist nachher nicht mehr nachvollziehbar welche Fehlverhalten welche Wirkung hatten. Denn die Biochemie unserer K√∂rper \"schmerzt\" nicht augenblicklich sobald man etwas schlechtes tut - sie passt sich eben einfach nur an. Still, leise, unbemerkt - eben subtil. Und so geht das von Minute zu Minute. Von Stunde zu Stunde. Und von Tag zu Tag. Da die meisten Menschen davon jedoch nicht wirklich etwas echt verstehen - sondern all dies entweder total ignorieren oder einfach nur in stiller Hoffnung irgendwelche Handlungen einleiten - ruinieren sich nicht wenige nach und nach ihre Gesundheit. Das ist in etwa so wie extreme Gesinnung und ausgepr√§gte Dummheit immer wieder zueinander finden. Irgendwann entsteht daraus dann beim einzelnen Selbstmitleid. Dieses schl√§gt dann nach und nach in Wut, Aggression und Frustration um. Ein Mensch der davon innerlich nicht los kommen kann - geht immer zuerst ins Exil und sinnt dann auf Rache. Und so √§hnlich ist die menschliche Verhaltensweise auch innerhalb der Gesundheit. Der Zerfall wird auf alles m√∂gliche geschoben - nur nicht auf die eigenen Fehler. Dies jedoch √§ndert absolut nichts an der harten Wahrheit: die Betreffenden sind selbst die Verursacher ihrer Lage. Punkt. Subtilit√§t ist die Rache der Biochemie. Sie verzeiht Fehler nie.

READ BELOW\n\nI want to give a few examples from the Trump presidency how this was all SCRIPTED in advance. Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton had a bunch of fake tough talk between each other during the campaigns in 2016, with Trump even claiming he'd put Hillary in jail once he got elected. But after Trump won, he had a luncheon in January 2017, where he honored and applauded, not only Hillary, but also Bill Clinton. PROVING IT'S ALL STAGED AND ALL PHONY! \n\nWe also have Trump's text hotline number which is 88022. I've shown before how Trump is \"88\" in Simple Gematria. I think 8s and 2s were also symbolic of this Pandemic (the new 9\/11) during Trump's Presidency. \n\nTrump made a statement on October 5, 2017 that it was the \"CALM BEFORE THE STORM\". If you add ***888 DAYS*** to October 5, 2017, you get March 11, 2020 which is the date WHO declared this a GLOBAL PANDEMIC. \n\nAnd from 9\/11\/2001 terror attacks up to 3\/11\/2020 there are **222 MONTHS** in between. I think Trump's text hotline was giving us a clue with 88022 (the 8s and the 2s and how they were symbolic). \n\nThen you have the 1990 \"Heavy Metal Magazine Comic Strip\" where Trump and a populist named Helmsley build a WALL in New York City. They eventually have a rift with each other, and Helmsley dismantles Trump. But Trump is poised to make a strong comeback and he hands Mike Tyson a 'hat', and says that they were both hit below the belt by Helmsley but they will be #1 AGAIN (implying a COMEBACK for both of them). \n\nIn November 2020, Mike Tyson has a COMEBACK FIGHT with Roy Jones Jr. It seems there are a ton of clues here that everything during Donald Trump's presidency (even menial things like Mike Tyson fighting again) have been SCRIPTED long in advance.","NumberOfLikes":3,"Hashtags":["#1"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598371498,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 18:04:58 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"awe_some_street","CaptionText":"‚úùÔ∏è","NumberOfLikes":7,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598344432,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 10:33:52 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"awe_some_street","CaptionText":"‚úùÔ∏è","NumberOfLikes":3,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by AWE on August 25, 2020.

He's the CTO for Cochise County and wanted to liven things up a bit when working in the office so we thought fun masks were one way to start. Just had to ask for the order and she delivered beyond belief! So great. üòç She also made them larger which helps not just fit his face better but actually fits over the KN95 masks he has for work, too.\n\n*Swipe to see both designs!*\n\nThe IT department deals with so much, and even more so during this time where nearly every one is online. While their team may be able to work remotely for the most part, they are also the ones fixing and deploying things on site. And \"on site\" in Cochise County includes a LOT of locations all across the county. Often times there are techs, administrators, and management going into jails, courts, SEACOM, etc. to help set things up, get things working, and keep it all running. They do Elections work. Work with educators. The health department. Very important they are all protected when interacting in person, too. They now know masks protect both wearers to varying degrees depending on proper usage and type, so always wear one if you are able. (My husband also has asthma so it does put him at risk but when you have a job to do where so many employees and constituents are relying on your work, especially with the Elections stuff on top of the regular duties to keep the County connected, you take proper precautions and get the job done.)\n\n#WearAMask #inBisbee #CustomMade #FilterPocket #Matrix #Hardware #Circuits #TechLife #CTO #ChiefTechnologyOfficer #EssentialWorkers #Government #Computers #InformationTechnology #MadeInBisbee #LucyStJohn #RedboneVintage #BisbeeAZ #CochiseCounty #TechStuff #TuesdayTech #BeSafe #Covid19 #Coronavirus #Pandemic #Arizona #partakeInStyle #CovidStyle","NumberOfLikes":12,"Hashtags":["#WearAMask","#inBisbee","#CustomMade","#FilterPocket","#Matrix","#Hardware","#Circuits","#TechLife","#CTO","#ChiefTechnologyOfficer","#EssentialWorkers","#Government","#Computers","#InformationTechnology","#MadeInBisbee","#LucyStJohn","#RedboneVintage","#BisbeeAZ","#CochiseCounty","#TechStuff","#TuesdayTech","#BeSafe","#Covid19","#Coronavirus","#Pandemic","#Arizona","#partakeInStyle","#CovidStyle"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598370870,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 17:54:30 CEST 2020","Location":"Bisbee, Arizona"},{"Owner":"penndistilling","CaptionText":"Shipping to addresses in Pennsylvania!\n\nJust visit our online store by clicking the \"Buy Now\" button on our webpage www.penndistilling.com or by clicking the \"Shop Now\" button on our Facebook page.

Many of us have children who will be starting remote learning in September, which has another set of unique challenges.  Read on for a few tips to help your child if they'll be transitioning to learning online in a few weeks. \u2060‚†Ä\n\u2060‚†Ä\n1.  Our first tip is exactly the same no matter what learning looks like!  Starting school or starting a new school year can be stressful at the best of time, let alone during a global pandemic.  You can make your child feel at ease by having an open conversation about what it is that's worrying them and letting them know that it's natural to feel anxious. \u2060‚†Ä\n\u2060‚†Ä\n2.  Just because all learning will be happening online doesn't mean social interaction has to be put on hold.  Whenever you can, facilitate in-person interaction, which can be as simple as reading to a younger child, or asking an older one about something they learned that day.  Where possible, smaller social 'pods' may make sense if you have opted for remote learning, where children can socialize and connect with their peers outside or at a distance.\u2060‚†Ä\n\u2060‚†Ä\n3.  Structure is key.  Children often do much better when the expectations are clear ... exactly when during the day will online learning take place?  When will they break for snacks or lunch?  When will there be free time or time for physical activity?  Take it one step further and have your child work with you to create their schedule, which can help them to be more invested.\u2060‚†Ä\n\u2060‚†Ä\n4.  As a parent facilitator, be as prepared as possible.  Budget time to deal with technical difficulties, especially for younger children.  Write down every single website, user login, and password somewhere central and keep it where your child, and any adult supervising, has easy access.\u2060‚†Ä\n\u2060\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n#tiptuesday #backtoschool #youranxiouschild #yournervouschild #coronavirus #pandemic #remotelearning #childpsychologist #psychotherapy #therapy #mentalhealth #mentalhealthsupport #mentalhealthclinic #anxiety  #toronto #fairmarcpsychology","NumberOfLikes":4,"Hashtags":["#tiptuesday","#backtoschool","#youranxiouschild","#yournervouschild","#coronavirus","#pandemic","#remotelearning","#childpsychologist","#psychotherapy","#therapy","#mentalhealth","#mentalhealthsupport","#mentalhealthclinic","#anxiety","#toronto","#fairmarcpsychology"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Fairmarc Psychology Centre on August 25, 2020.

The report also posits that it might be time to rethink traditional ideas about supply and demand\n\nIn capitalist societies, the theory goes that consumer need drives the rest of the economy \u2013 businesses will only produce things for which there is a demand. But the reality of 21st-century global capitalism is a little more complex than that \u2013¬†some economists argue that growth itself is the problem.\n\nWriting shortly before World Environment Day, the Forum\u2019s founder and executive chairman, Professor Klaus Schwab, called for a¬†great reset of capitalism in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. His vision of the great reset includes creating a stakeholder economy, where the market pursues fairer outcomes for all, underpinned by changes to tax, regulatory and fiscal policies, and new trade arrangements.\n\nSchwab also calls for investments that advance shared goals, such as equality and sustainability. This is something that is already taking place in parts of the world where economic-stimulus programmes are being enacted.\n\nIn addition, Schwab urges us to address health and social challenges with the innovations made possible by the Fourth Industrial Revolution. That means more public\/private collaboration in pursuit of the public good.\n\nThe pandemic has devastated families and brought major economies to a standstill. But by directing resources into new and improved systems and processes, rather than shoring up the existing ones, Schwab believes a lasting change for the better is possible.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n@wefbookclub @_our_environment__ @wefutureglobal @welljesslife @wefornature #nature #affluence #luxury #needs #planet #people #value #environment #social #governance #industries #covid #covid19 #Coronavirus #corona #pandemic #lockdown #lockdown2020","NumberOfLikes":46,"Hashtags":["#nature","#affluence","#luxury","#needs","#planet","#people","#value","#environment","#social","#governance","#industries","#covid","#covid19","#Coronavirus","#corona","#pandemic","#lockdown","#lockdown2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Neelam on August 25, 2020.

PARTICIPATE\nIf you pm me your address I sent you 2 postcards: one you can leave yourself, another one please send me back.  CONCEPT\nIn order to fully experience and appreciate the world\u2019s richness humans have been drawn to travel. However since the COVID-19 pandemic travel has been significantly restricted, often limiting our world to within the home or even a single room. Moving past my initial frustrations, I felt compelled to invent new ways to deal with such an imposing and unexpected limitation.\nUsing only a scanner and the objects already in my room I created a mass from which a new world emerged. Moving clothes and objects while scanning I was creating mountains, valleys, rivers and plants previously non-existent.\n¬†\nThe word \u201Eisolation\u201C comes from isoleÃÅ (fr.), isolato (it.) and also insula (it.) meaning island. The word \u201Escanner\u201C was used in past times to describe a \u201Eperson who examines critically\u201D.\n¬†\nThrough the act of scanning I wanted to investigate how \u2028I can reimagine what was already in my proximity. In that moment of creation I finally felt free. Free from any limitations and feeling supported by these newly redefined spaces around me. Things that were before so insignificant to me now became my doorway into an unlimited dimension of creativity and inspiration. From within my isolation an imagined island was born, which I preserved in physical form through this collection of postcards.\n\nTo find more you can on my website https:\/\/anfisa.love\/10\/ .......................................................................................#speculative #speculativefutures #speculativedesign #design #pandemic #lockdown #future #contemporarydesign #glitch #technology #futuredesign #fictiondesign #onlineshow","NumberOfLikes":68,"Hashtags":["#speculative","#speculativefutures","#speculativedesign","#design","#pandemic","#lockdown","#future","#contemporarydesign","#glitch","#technology","#futuredesign","#fictiondesign","#onlineshow"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1598358951,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 14:35:51 CEST 2020","Location":"Berlin, Germany"},{"Owner":"chetanafoundation","CaptionText":"Dm to register\n.\n.\nCertificate Program on Basic Counseling Skills\n.\n.\n#elearning #mentalhealth #empathy #depression #suicide #ngo #mentalhealthngo #onlinelearning #counseling #basiccounsellingskills #covid19 #pandemic","NumberOfLikes":7,"Hashtags":["#elearning","#mentalhealth","#empathy","#depression","#suicide","#ngo","#mentalhealthngo","#onlinelearning","#counseling","#basiccounsellingskills","#covid19","#pandemic"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Chetana Foundation on August 25, 2020.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598358824,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 14:33:44 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"onlynowis","CaptionText":"#surfer #surf #surfphotography #f4f #venicebeach #420 #venice #surfing #skating #motocross #beachvolleyball #ocean #factsmatter #STOPYELLINGATME #fashion #corvid #lgbtq #pandemic #pagan #Scientist #zombie #blm #womensempowerment #feminism #freethenipple #cousinbri","NumberOfLikes":9,"Hashtags":["#surfer","#surf","#surfphotography","#f4f","#venicebeach","#420","#venice","#surfing","#skating","#motocross","#beachvolleyball","#ocean","#factsmatter","#STOPYELLINGATME","#fashion","#corvid","#lgbtq","#pandemic","#pagan","#Scientist","#zombie","#blm","#womensempowerment","#feminism","#freethenipple","#cousinbri"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @onlynowis in Venice Beach.

Whether it\u2019s politics, race, or the latest headline, our cultural default seems to be an \u201CUs vs. Them\u201D mentality. What\u2019s fascinating is that this was as true in Jesus\u2019s day as it is in our own. For example, Brad demonstrates how Jesus\u2019s own disciples reflected the vast diversity and difference in his world. As a result, Jesus chose such a group that grew because of their unity, not uniformity. \n__\nFurthermore, Brad shares how at the heart of the Scriptures is this idea: God wants his followers to live unified through love and respect, and welcome the diversity. This is part one in a series that will explore Jesus\u2019s rich tradition of honoring the dignity of difference.

All of our weddings this Spring and Summer have been postponed to later dates. However one special wedding was not postponed but rather creatively reimagined. The family decided to still hold the ceremony but instead of inviting their 300+ friends and family, only inviting a very small amount with social distancing in mind. They would live stream the ceremony to others that couldn't make it. Then in 2021 hold a fabulous reception. Here is a shots of the lovely bride and will share more in a future blog post. We hope you all are staying safe and enjoying being with your family during this interesting season in our lives.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#gardenwedding #socialdistancewedding #bride #springwedding #outdoorceremony  #beautifulbride  #atlantaweddings #atlantawedding #sociallydistantwedding #socialdistance #covid19 #covid_19 #pandemic #pandemicwedding","NumberOfLikes":29,"Hashtags":["#Repost","#gardenwedding","#socialdistancewedding","#bride","#springwedding","#outdoorceremony","#beautifulbride","#atlantaweddings","#atlantawedding","#sociallydistantwedding","#socialdistance","#covid19","#covid_19","#pandemic","#pandemicwedding"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Brushworx Hair & Makeup in Atlanta, Georgia with @chanceycharm, @6offour, @faithflowersatl, @vintageenglishteacup, @kellysclosetatl, and @brushworx.

What? Say that again? Boarding pass, please?  Is this just a dream? Oh, man, yes, it is. Darn it, how I miss those 3 magic words that used to make my world rocks.  I usually travel all over the world at least once in a month, and it\u2019s been a while, a long while.\n\nSo I just sat and looked around my messy room and tried to sleep again without success to continue my cut dream about traveling.  Those days, I said to my scattered stuff everywhere: \u201DHey, I will take care of you, we are going to be cleaned up as soon as I have more time to spare, ok?\u201D. But after 6 months lockdown or social distancing where we have to stay at home, it didn\u2019t happen, look at this, my room still looks like a ground zero area after the earthquake, so I have to admit that it\u2019s not because of lacking the time at all.  Sigh. My dog looked at me and smiled \u201CThat\u2019s why I chew your shoes\u201D.Oh, you dog, just shut up!\n\nI went to my living room and saw my sister, an elementary teacher, glared to the cell phone and rubbed her eyes many times. She\u2019s exhausting for teaching and learning new things such as how to use the Google classroom, google meet, etc.\n\n\u201CHi, Sis. How is it going\u201D\n\u201CNuts! The parents are really pissed off with their own kid by now.  Where are those scientists hiding? If they can\u2019t find the vaccine fast enough, I believe the parents will\u201C.\n\nShe showed me the WA between parents and teacher writing back and forth.  I read it some and laughed \n\u201CWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201D she asked.\n\u201CLook at this. This kid was just trying to tell you that she was not the one who did the homework\u201D She read again but didn\u2019t get the funny part, of course, she has too many to worry about.\n \u201CYour student is telling you that her mom was mad because you gave a 60 for her English homework. The kid is happy with 60 but not her mom, because the mom was the one who did the homework, not the kid, that\u2019s why the mom was so angry with you.

There is nearly no availability of firearms or ammunition. This will not change till at least after the election and finding quality firearms or ammunition will be a feat. With riots, protests, civil unrest, and the first real pandemic in this generations lifetime; people are scared.  The best way to fight fear is with knowledge. Knowledge is power. You have to get informed. If you are one of the 5 million new gun owners across the United States, you have to get trained. There are limitless resources if you know where to look. We are living in an era where information is readily available and accessible at your fingertips. However, I want to caution you! There are countless charlatans.

Practice alone is the cause of success. This is the truth without any doubt\u201D\n.\nI love yoga clothes! I might not have started doing yoga had I not gotten a pair of lululemon\u2019s for Hannukah. But it\u2019s the sweat drops I shed every day on my mat that have transformed my life over the past 230-something days, not the pants. It is the fear, insecurity, and joy, I traverse while putting the philosophy into practice in my daily life. Having abs doesn\u2019t make me spiritual. Being overweight didn\u2019t make me lazy. If I have a mess in my car (and I\u2019m not saying whether I do or I don\u2019t), it doesn\u2019t make me messy. My CV does not make me a scientist. I am a scientist only when I wake up in the morning and fish the latest manuscript critique out of my email inbox and revise to resubmit. If god forbid tomorrow I hit my head and lost the ability to produce language, no number of publications on my CV would keep me \u201Ca scientist\u201D. So how much can my CV really matter? I am only \u201Ca scientist\u201D during the actual moments that I am doing science \u2013 this is what BEING a scientist means \u2013 it means being, not having.¬†The CV of your life will take care of itself if you practice, practice, practice.¬†The only thing we have is now.

What are you up to on Friday afternoon at 3:30pm EDT? Why not come to Luscious Mother\u2019s Free Community Call? This offering was born out of the Covid-19 crisis back in March and as long as the pandemic is playing out, we\u2019ll be showing up the last Friday of every month to offer support and love to every single mama with a zoom link and a desire to connect. Mothers are chronically under-supported, even in the best of times, and we became concerned about what might befall mothers while they're work from home, overseeing the remote education their kiddies, and loosing out on moments of privacy, as well as the completion of whole thoughts or tasks without interruption. A massive breakdown in momdom would be an even bigger crisis than the pandemic itself. (I mean, who would clean up the mess?) So we created a place for moms to be seen, heard, supported and loved-up while they are isolated and over-loaded on family \u201Ctogetherness\u201D time; a space for moms to feel the feelings, say the things and hear from other mothers who are riding similar struggle buses. \n\nCome get Luscious with moms from all backgrounds and geographic locations. Bring a coaching request if you have one, or just come to get connected, learn some strategies, and leave this 90 minute call feeling more grounded and ready to create possibilities for you and your family. Sisterhood is the salve for what ails you. Answer the call, mama! Our free 90 minute Community Calls take place on the last Friday of every month 12:30pm PST\/3:30pm EST. Our next call is this Friday, August 28th-- with the summer wrapping up and school starting, wouldn't this be a great time to connect with the #LusciousMother community? Join us!

Their admit card will have detailed instructions on social distancing.\n\nThe entry to the exam centre itself would be staggered and students will have to clear a thermal scan for gaining access. However, each exam centre will also have \"isolation rooms\" for those candidates whose body temperature is above 99.4 degrees fahrenheit.¬†\n\nIt must be noted that the guidelines do not clarify if candidates from containment zones would be allowed to write the examination as they may be asymptomatic but would have come in contact with a Covid-positive person recently.\nThe NTA issuing these instructions today indicates that the central government may go ahead with the plan to conduct the national entrance exams for the IITs, and medical courses despite the¬†growing demand to postpone¬†them in view of Covid restrictions and floods in many states.\nThe development comes days after the¬†NTA issued admit cards¬†for the two exams scheduled to be held in September.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#newdelhi #jeemains #jeeexam\n#neet #neetexam #jeeneetpostpone #supremecourt #commonexam #pandemic #coronavirus #lockdown2020 #indiacorona #educationsystem #postponeJEE_NEETincovid","NumberOfLikes":8,"Hashtags":["#newdelhi","#jeemains","#jeeexam","#neet","#neetexam","#jeeneetpostpone","#supremecourt","#commonexam","#pandemic","#coronavirus","#lockdown2020","#indiacorona","#educationsystem","#postponeJEE_NEETincovid"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Supreme court rejects plea to postpone JEE NEET exam","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598349872,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 12:04:32 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"robinrevispyke","CaptionText":"How to Maintain a Spirit of Peace in the New Normal\n\nIt\u2019s happening!

Major companies that flourished for years have sacked their decades old employee(s) lending them jobless at a time when money is very important to survive.In April nearly 12.2 crore Indians lost their jobs, and the number has only increased since then. There are families with home loans on their head, medical care for the young and the old eating them on the inside, school or college fees to pay and most importantly being able to put food on their plate. All of these factors have further contributed to the already existing stress of surviving a pandemic. Many who found themselves laid off have battled with self doubt and low-self esteem. What do you think our future would be like? How do you think one should console a friend who lost a job? Let us know in comment section below.

The Trump administration said they are looking to fast-track vaccines and treatments for the coronavirus - the S&P 500 reached record highs, closing above the 3,400 level, on the back of this news as bonds fell. However, there remains a wide disconnect within the markets themselves. The FT reported that the average S&P 500 stock is down 28.4% compared to its 52-week high. In fact, one-fifth of the stocks in the US Index are down over 50% from their all-time-highs. It is safe to say that the rallying market and all time highs are clouding the reality amidst the celebrations. Nonetheless, further to the White House annoucement, the Food and Drug Administration, over the weekend, said that it is working to expand access to a virus treatment involving blood plasma from recovered patients. \u2063\n\u2063\nüõ¢A big story brewing in the crude oil market relates to the two storms, Marco and Laura, which are rolling towards the US Gulf Coast. They are expected to come ashore as soon as Monday. This is the first time two hurricanes are heading into the same direction, which can have devastating impacts, not just on livelihoods but an already battered crude oil market. Almost 82% of the oil production in the US Gulf of Mexico has been shut down as a threat prompted evacuations of off-shore energy platforms and set residents and officials on edge from Texas to Florida. Oil and gasoline prices rallied on potential disruption in supply.","NumberOfLikes":17,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598345199,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 10:46:39 CEST 2020","Location":"London, United Kingdom"},{"Owner":"radiconlabs","CaptionText":"GERMS HOT SPOTS\n\n#coronavirus #covid #corona #stayhome #quarantine #lockdown #staysafe #socialdistancing #virus #love #rus #coronav #stayathome #coronatime #worldhealthorganisation #pandemic #o #a #memes #pandemia #instagram #s  #health #instagood #like #n #follow #quarentena #bhfyp #radicon","NumberOfLikes":7,"Hashtags":["#coronavirus","#covid","#corona","#stayhome","#quarantine","#lockdown","#staysafe","#socialdistancing","#virus","#love","#rus","#coronav","#stayathome","#coronatime","#worldhealthorganisation","#pandemic","#o","#a","#memes","#pandemia","#instagram","#s","#health","#instagood","#like","#n","#follow","#quarentena","#bhfyp","#radicon"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Radicon on August 25, 2020 tagging @designsatkpr, and @radiconlabs.

In fact, they collaborate together to produce holistic programs targeting all the pillars of one's well-being. Some of them had undergone training and continuously working towards their licenses to become practitioners too. They serve as the primary responder to offer psychosocial support in their community, combining faith-based and scientific interventions they learned from grad school. However, not everyone in the religious community pursued further studies apart from their spiritual practices.¬†\n\nThis is the reason why I believe Mental Health Professionals reacted to the IATF urging for religious leaders to address the suicide cases phenomenon rather than the experts in the field. While there\u2019s an existing Mental Health Act already known as RA 11036, the context is still viewed as something that one can just pray over and the specialists who spent years  of studying human behavior and mental processes to be able to treat each individual with utmost care still remained unrecognized.\n\nThe lack of acceptance that Mental Health is just as important as physical health, and mental illnesses are real, brain-related disorders that need to be treated scientifically by experts is the main concern of people in the helping profession. While they consider the spiritual aspect in addressing suicide cases, I hope they would also acknowledge the presence of our Mental Health Professionals, the experts, who can deal the concerns related to mental health (or what they call, the next pandemic).\n\n#mentalhealth #mentalhealthadvocate\n#mentalhealthphilippines \n#mentalhealthawareness #guidancecounselor #psychologist #psychiatrist #wellness #covid19 #pandemic","NumberOfLikes":13,"Hashtags":["#mentalhealth","#mentalhealthadvocate","#mentalhealthphilippines","#mentalhealthawareness","#guidancecounselor","#psychologist","#psychiatrist","#wellness","#covid19","#pandemic"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Centennial Tita üíÉ on August 24, 2020.
