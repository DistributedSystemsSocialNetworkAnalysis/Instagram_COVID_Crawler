Meditation is the #practice of intentionally bringing #awareness to our #thoughts, #feelings, and bodily sensations in the #mental space of #observance and #acceptance. Meditation isn\u2019t about #becoming a different person, a new person, or even a better person. It\u2019s about gaining a #healthy sense of perspective of our #mind, #body, and #soul. \n\nToday I would like to introduce you to a simple way to start meditating:\n\n1) Set a timer for 5 - 10 minutes. Choose a gentle soft tone. Sit in a way that is alert yet #relaxed. Close your eyes. 😌\n\n2) Direct your #attention to the experience of #breathing, the #sensations of the in-breath and the sensations of the out-breath.✨\n\n3) If you\u2019ve noticed your mind has wandered, that\u2019s perfectly natural. Take a note and then gently but firmly bring your attention back to your breathing. Breath in and breath out, the full cycle of breath. 🧘\u200D♀️\n\n4) Stay with the breath. When the timer goes off take three slightly deeper breaths at your own pace. And then, whenever you\u2019re ready, open your eyes. 🌱\n\nDo you practice meditation to find your #balance?\n\nWould you like to know about guided meditation and perhaps try one out guided by me? 💫\n\nPlease show me some support in the comments and I will record a stress relieving meditation this week 🤗\n\n📸 Photo Credit  @260studios \n\nReferences: \nhttps:\/\/www.headspace.com\/meditation-101\/what-is-meditation\n\nhttps:\/\/www.prevention.com\/health\/mental-health\/a32934987\/how-to-meditate\/","NumberOfLikes":51,"Hashtags":["#stress","#calm","#mind","#pandemic,","#world.","#Meditation.","#meditation","#techniques.","#practice","#awareness","#thoughts,","#feelings,","#mental","#observance","#acceptance.","#becoming","#healthy","#mind,","#body,","#soul.","#relaxed.","#attention","#breathing,","#sensations","#balance?"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":10,"Timestamp":1598326772,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 05:39:32 CEST 2020","Location":"Old Town"},{"Owner":"hecstaton","CaptionText":"Are u wearing a mask? 👁\n#mask #pandemic #pink","NumberOfLikes":7,"Hashtags":["#mask","#pandemic","#pink"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Héctor on August 24, 2020.

And goodness did that hit HOME. \n\nThats besides the post of this \"new current post,\" cause mid post, my incredible, serving husband drew me up this bath cause he could sense my anxiety level climbing throughout the night. My rock, my love, my best friend ❤  Thank you for always being such a loving husband!!! \n\nSo I will leave you with a little piece of my \"old post\" \n\nOur new normal is always feeling a little off balance, like trying to stand in a dinghy on rough seas, and not knowing when the storm will pass. But humans can get better at anything with practice, so at least I now have some ideas for working on my sea legs.\n\nI'm still working with my sea legs, navigating how life looks. But I'm absolutely an optimist, a problem solver, and solution based. I KNOW I will come out stronger than ever.

Demonstrators marched to the Portland Police Bureau\u2019s North Precinct where a riot was declared shortly after 11 p.m. Sunday, eventually leading to police deploying tear gas and arresting 23 people on the 87th night of political unrest in the city. A Black man was hospitalized in serious condition after police shot him several times in the back as he opened the door of a parked vehicle in Kenosha, Wisconsin; that man turned out to be 29 year-old Jacob Blake. The Wisconsin cops shot him in the back 7 times while his kids were in the car. The shooting sparked outrage in Kenosha, which is located nearly 40 miles south of Milwaukee, as protesters gathered at the scene of the shooting. Several businesses in the area were vandalized and about 50 cars were set on fire. City and state officials on Sunday decried the actions of about 75 people who started fires, broke windows, injured a police officer and damaged property Saturday night during an \u201CAbolish the Police\u201D protest outside the Denver Police Department\u2019s headquarters; 12 people were arrested.

En él, después de puntualizar en varios de los avances para hacerle seguimiento al nuevo coronavirus, el jefe de Estado comunicó que este nuevo criterio obedece a una realidad: la vacuna aún no está cerca y por ahora, dijo, nada garantiza que quienes han dado positivo para el virus, tengan luego inmunidad.\n\n\u201CEs un camino de adaptación. Tenemos que convivir con el virus y hay que buscar un escenario de corresponsabilidad\u201D, expresó sobre la nueva fase que asume el país. \u201CTenemos categorizados municipios sin afectación y de baja, mediana y alta afectación. Bajo ese criterio, la nueva fase nos regimos por restricciones puntuales a eventos y aglomeraciones.

Watson\u2019s entire boyhood was spent in Chicago where he attended for eight years Horace Mann Grammar School and for two years South Shore High School. He then received a tuition scholarship to the University of Chicago, and in the summer of 1943 entered their experimental four-year college. Watson is unmarried and has no children. In 1947, he received a B.Sc. degree in Zoology During these years his boyhood interest in bird-watching had matured into a serious desire to learn genetics. This became possible when he received a Fellowship for graduate study in Zoology at Indiana University in Bloomington, where he received his Ph.D. degree in Zoology in 1950. At Indiana, he was deeply influenced both by the geneticists H. J. Muller and T. M. Sonneborn, and by S. E. Luria, the Italian-born microbiologist then on the staff of Indiana\u2019s Bacteriology Department. Watson\u2019s Ph.D. thesis, done under Luria\u2019s able guidance, was a study of the effect of hard X-rays on bacteriophage multiplication. From September 1950 to September 1951 he spent his first postdoctoral year in Copenhagen as a Merck Fellow of the National Research Council. During the spring of 1951, he went with Kalckar to the Zoological Station at Naples. There at a Symposium, late in May, he met Maurice Wilkins and saw for the first time the X-ray diffraction pattern of crystalline DNA. This greatly stimulated him to change the direction of his research toward the structural chemistry of nucleic acids and proteins...

But why is it so SO so scary that people even shy away from saying that word? I\u2019ll tell ya, its because change comes with a pretty little bag of emotions we\u2019ve been storing away so generously.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nWe think \u201Cpushing the bad emotions away\u201D is keeping us in a positive mindset, in reality it\u2019s keeping you more stressed.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n🌿SO LET\u2019S CHECK IN🌿\n\u2022Take a deep breath in, deep breath out\n\u2022Relax your shoulders, Unhinge you\u2019re jaw, Relax your tongue\n\u2022Ask yourself, are you filling yourself up with other people\u2019s opinions, fears, worries, social media\u2019s, beliefs. Whether they are good or bad, are you filling yourself up with other people\u2019s shit - becoming the dumpster?\n\u2022Or are you the dumper - complaining to anyone and everyone who will listen, dumping emotions, judging till no end?\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nBe honest.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nIt\u2019s okay. Some of us might feel ashamed of it. Don\u2019t be, you are human navigating a new time.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nLast question to ask yourself is, \u201CWhat is the emotion I least like to feel right now?\u201D And let yourself know that it\u2019s okay you don\u2019t like to feel that feeling.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nBut hold onto it anyways. Literally, hold out your hands and hold onto this emotion. See that emotion, name that emotion, hold that emotion for a moment, nature it, it\u2019s a part of you.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nBeing with your emotions (good or bad) is healthy. Being with your emotions reduces stress. Reducing stress strengthens the immune system. A strong immune system helps you fight off sicknesses.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nWe are the human family trying to get through this new time together. WE GOT THIS!

At the Neighborhood Playhouse, his work with actors who did not consider themselves singers was wondrous and unlocked a lot of value for those he taught.

By contrast, mice that had the vaccine inserted up their noses before exposure had no measurable viral RNA in their lungs.

Só de alguém falar sobre novo normal, meu sentimento é de tristeza. \n\nAlém de todas as vidas perdidas, e de todo o impacto negativo que essa pandemia causou a todos nós, eu tento, mas tem dias que é bem difícil ser otimista, afinal, vivemos em um país onde parece não haver luz no fim do túnel, e ficamos todos à espera de uma vacina, que parece que não ficará pronta nunca. E mesmo assim, não há garantias de que a vida volte a ser como era antes. \n\nE acho que esse sentimento de desesperança parece geral, afinal, o que sinto mais falta, que essa pandemia me \u201Ctirou\u201D foi a liberdade. E se você me conhece ao menos um pouco, sabe como isso é muito importante para mim.\n\nPerguntei esses dias nos stories do que vocês sentem mais falta do mundo antes da pandemia. A maioria das respostas foram viajar, abraços, ou de simples saídas pra dançar, ir ao cinema, encher a alma com cultura. Quanta liberdade essa pandemia nos tirou. \n\nMas a minha reflexão aqui é sobre tudo que ganhamos com isso. \n\nSim, eu sou privilegiada. Acredito que a grande parte das pessoas que vai ler isso aqui também é. E num balanço geral, o que mais ganhei com isso tudo foi tempo. \n\nTempo, que muitas vezes é nosso inimigo, ou a gente acha que é, tem sido meu maior aliado. Há alguns anos eu estava vivendo em um ritmo frenético, por conta da vida e trabalho que escolhi. Isso nunca me fez infeliz, pelo contrário, mas dentre todas as coisas que eu estava fazendo, não sobrava tempo para fazer outras. \n\nQue privilégio poder passar mais tempo com a minha família, também de poder estudar tantas coisas novas e esse tempo tem me feito praticar ainda mais o autoconhecimento. Além da minha felicidade em encontrar um novo propósito para a minha fotografia. Parecia que eu precisava desse tempo.

I was in remission, and thriving with more great days than bad days health wise. \u2063\n\u2063\nBut now since having COVID for over 60 days this spring, my body has suffered greatly from the pesky pathogen.\u2063\n\u2063\nAnd even though it is very discouraging and heart breaking to witness my results and experience these symptoms of my autoimmune diseases, I know this is an opportunity to share my journey of healing my body once again with all of you.\u2063\n\u2063\nPeople with chronic illness will have a longer battle with COVID, than the average individual. \u2063\nIt won\u2019t be just a cold to us sadly. It influences every aspect of our bodies and health. And while this has been honestly a very traumatic experience losing my health again this year, I know this is just a season I am going through. \u2063\n\u2063\nGod brought me out of the season of infirmity in 2017, and he can do it again.\u2063\n\u2063\nThe only way we can truly overcome these health battles by having to start from rock bottom scratch, is through our mind and spirit. \u2063\n\u2063\nEven though my body is feeling weaker, my spirit remains strong.\u2063\nIt\u2019s a war fighting for your health and it should always be taken seriously.\u2063\n\u2063\nBecause the one thing that influences all areas of your life, is your health. \u2063\n\u2063\nIf you lose your health, be prepared to lose everything along with it. It\u2019s just how it happens. But it doesn\u2019t mean you cannot build new and stronger and better areas of your life.\u2063\n\u2063\nIt means you have this opportunity to restore everything. \u2063\n\u2063\nCOVID is a beast and it was sent to steal, kill, and destroy lives. That is the truth. \u2063\nBut what is also the truth is we have the choice to allow it to do those things or fight back the best we can.\u2063\n\u2063\nEach person\u2019s journey with COVID will look different, but each person will be facing a battle. \u2063\n\u2063\nWhat\u2019s important is remaining grounded in hope, faith, trust, perseverance, endurance, and gumption.\u2063\n\u2063\nCOVID is only a season, not our destiny.","NumberOfLikes":143,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Healing Chronic Illness in San Diego, California with @babesinscrubs, @gomacro, @allheartscrubs, @medicalschoolhq, @scrubsandbeyond, @scrubsmag, @mdfinstruments, @peoplehopeorg, @spoonie_support, @morethanlyme, @womeninmedicine, @chronicloveclub, and @spoonie.collective.","NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1598310401,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 01:06:41 CEST 2020","Location":"San Diego, California"},{"Owner":"jomuffins","CaptionText":"\"Sapio-Exhibitionism\"\n\nI did that weird thing again.\nAbsolutely impossible to photograph though.

But like everyone else, I was not privy to this information beforehand. I know they say \"for warned is for armed\", but no one could have prepared for this.\u2063\n\u2063\nand yet, some businesses are being held accountable for things they never could have planned for. In #Scotland, there are still many businesses that are not allowed to open, they have tried their best to work around this. We are still on the verge of a possible second lockdown, and even our government isn't recognising smaller newly started up businesses as ones that require funding and help. \u2063\n\u2063\nI never planned for a global pandemic, I never thought I'd have to factor this into the equation, I would never have put all my savings into something that could have possibly been wiped out by a virus. Had I thought this would happen in my lifetime I would have thought differently on trying to go it alone. And that's the thing, I am alone when it comes to running my business (like many people at the moment), I dont have staff that can take the added workload, I can't afford a tax officiant. I've had to loan my own business money to keep it going, I've had to weigh up the costs of abandoning something I was passionate about or continuing to pursue it despite the fact that there is no certainty things are going to look up anytime soon. I've had to risk the food on the table, the rent that needs to be paid, the small luxuries of having a car in order to transport my family from A to B. Yet I'm still held accountable as if there is no global pandemic effecting my business. \u2063\n\n(Continued in slides)","NumberOfLikes":25,"Hashtags":["#business","#lockdown.\u2063","#pandemic","#Scotland,"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1598308192,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 00:29:52 CEST 2020","Location":"Scotland"},{"Owner":"slah_baby","CaptionText":"Ficar de máscara é que nem homem de barba.

The 22-year-old mother, Mei Xiang, has been at the zoo since 2000 and because of her age, was perceived to not be able to birth a cub, but she pulled through. Also, female pandas are only able to conceive children 24 to 72 hours per year, making timing of inseminating Mei Xiang extremely crucial. The Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI) used the frozen semen from 22-year-old Tian Tian, the male giant Panda at the zoo. The cub is the size of a stick of butter, about 1\/900 of the mother\u2019s size. Pandas are icons of conservation movements for animals. For a long time, the panda species was classified as \u201Cendangered\u201D by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, due to many animal protection awareness and action, there was a 17% increase in the panda population over the past decade, moving the pandas from \u201Cendangered\u201D to \u201Cvulnerable\u201D. Presently, there are about 1,800 wild pandas with around 500 held in captivity. (@aidan.mathews ) \n-\n-\n-\nHave an idea?

A resposta é simples: não só pode como deve!⠀\n⠀\nPrecisamos entender que o creme dental, ou como preferem alguns, o dentifrício, é um produto químico que requer uma supervisão técnica da empresa que o fabrica, e por isso tem uma prescrição correta do produto.

These children that would be taught could be siblings of the volunteer or children a block or two away. The subjects which would be taught are #Englishlanguage , #Mathematics, #Personalhygiene (given the current situation in the world) and any other subjects of choice. Given the current condition in the world, a high level of personal hygiene is strictly required to be practiced while teaching both by the children and the tutor and in view of that, a minimum of four(4) and a maximum of (10) \n\nDo you want to be part of this movement, please support us via this account details or call +2348039380972\n\n📌First Bank\nSavings\nAccount name: Naza Agape Foundation\nAccount Number: 3137028891\n\n📌Union Bank\nCurrent account\nAccount name: Naza Agape Foundation\nAccount Number: 0128013877\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n #ngo #universe #unicef #unstoppable #agenda2030 #youth #instagamer #qualityeducation #teamwork #changinglives  #partnership","NumberOfLikes":25,"Hashtags":["#impactproject","#13","#103","#pandemic","#impactproject","#impactproject","#initiative","#Coronapandemic.","#children","#Nigeria","#beyond.","#volunteer","#neighbourhoods.","#Englishlanguage","#Mathematics,","#Personalhygiene","#ngo","#universe","#unicef","#unstoppable","#agenda2030","#youth","#instagamer","#qualityeducation","#teamwork","#changinglives","#partnership"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598294656,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 24 20:44:16 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"abc3340","CaptionText":"All Tuscaloosa bars and bar service at restaurants will be closed for two weeks starting at 5 pm today, in an effort to prevent an outbreak of COVID-19 at the University of Alabama.

It has been tried since early in the year in China, the Netherlands, and also in the US, where more than 70,000 patients have received it already as part of studies or under case-by-case medical exemptions, according to the US Food and Drug Administration. However, some doctors have criticized how the treatment has been handled in the US. Because doctors have been allowed to give plasma to tens of thousands of patients outside of trials, they say, it\u2019s been difficult to gather decisive evidence on the effects. \n\nThe approval of the use of plasma also comes days after President Trump took to Twitter to accuse the FDA and the \u201Cdeep state, or whoever\u201D of slow-walking cures in order to interfere with his chances in the November general election.\n\nThe plasma approval could foreshadow US government actions around a vaccine for covid-19, some scientists fear. The chief doctor coordinating vaccine studies in the US has said data supporting a vaccine won\u2019t be in hand until January at the earliest, but the Financial Times reported that the administration is looking to fast-track an emergency approval of a vaccine before Election Day.  If an unsafe or ineffective vaccine goes into wide use, that will be a bigger setback than we\u2019ll suffer if convalescent plasma proves a dud. That is because plasma is given to people who are already sick, while vaccines are given to healthy people. Click the link in our bio to learn more.
