Tapi kali ini, aku mau bicara tentang not *trying* to find meaning (yet).\n\nIde ini muncul dari salah satu pertanyaan dalam diskusi UNITY Book Club (hi, there @unity_4mentalhealth and @minatbakat.unity 👋🏼) Bukankah merenung dan mencari makna itu melelahkan? Apakah kita HARUS mencari makna dari segala sesuatu?\n\nWell I\u2019d say: not always. Ada kalanya emosi kita sedang meluap-luap, dan begitu overwhelming sehingga kita sulit berpikir, apalagi merenung dalam-dalam. In that case, it is much better to let your mind stay in the present moment. Fokuslah mengerjakan rutinitas sehari-hari. Tapi kalau biasanya kita beraktivitas seraya pikiran melanglang buana, kali ini fokuskan seluruh pikiran dan perhatian kita ke kegiatan right here right now. Yes, sesederhana apapun kegiatan itu. Instead of trying to find meaning, try to follow the natural rhythm of every day, even the natural flow of your breath. \n\nKetika emosi yang tidak menyenangkan sedang membanjirimu, tarik napas dalam dan lambat. Sayangi otakmu dengan memberinya banyak oksigen. Penuhi pancaindramu dengan hal-hal indah: semerbak biji kopi, pemandangan hijau, gemericik air, setetes madu di ujung lidah, sentuhan bunga liar di pinggir jalan. Love yourself enough so that you can simply exist.\n\nMeaning will find you later. 💚\n\n\u2014\n\u201CHappiness cannot be pursued; it must ensue.\u201D\n(Viktor Frankl)\n\u2014\n\n#mentalhealthawareness #sehatjiwa #depression #depresi #anxiety #hope #mentalhealth #covid19 #pandemic2020 #liveandletlive #succulents #succulentsofinstagram #mindfulness #mindful #mindfulliving #makingbetterchoices #psikologi","NumberOfLikes":18,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Anna Elissa, OP in Bogor, Indonesia.

In mere 229 pages Murakami creates magic and how beautifully! 'Sputnik Sweetheart' has moved me in ways more than one. It touched something in my heart that I have always shielded from the world and for that I'm grateful.\n\n#japreviews20 \n\n'Sputnik Sweetheart' is essentially a love story but not a love story. I know that statement sounds ambiguous but I'll tell you why I said it. So basically this is a story of Sumire, Miu and the narrator 'K'. The narrator is in love with Sumire but  Sumire is in love with a woman who is 17 years older than her named Miu and Miu is married and not in love. Sumire is an aspiring writer, Miu is a glamorous and successful woman and Miu and the women go on a vacation and Sumire mysteriously disappears that's the basics. I won't give away a lot because I feel that takes away the essence of reading the book and I want you all to read it and to feel what I felt.\n\nThis is a book that is as light as a feather and yet as fierce as the wind. It will make you feel things, of course but it also makes you introspect and that is an achievement in itself. The idea of loneliness is what Murakami plays at in this book and it makes you crave for someone you might have known lifetimes ago. Yes, the writing is that powerful! Murakami creates an alternate universe, an alternate reality but he talks about it so passionately that you come to believe it. He spares no details and the way he writes, it feels that every page, every paragraph, every line is important and can't let your focus budge but he holds your interest and that's his power! I clearly am in awe of what I have read. \n\nBefore you ask me, I'll say it! This tote is from @books__etc! Just look at how cute it is! And man, so spacious and light weight!

In New York\u2019s hair salons, women are requesting fewer bangs and wispy styles to avoid touching their face often. Others are choosing styles that will look good even when grown out in case salons are forced to shut again. Hair stylists are being asked to apply their creativity in coming up with stylish yet practical solutions for corona-conscious clients!\n\nAs many people anticipate fewer social and professional interactions in person, they have seized the opportunity to experiment with funky and bold new hairstyles. On some we have seen exciting pinks and greens, and on others we have seen mohawks and mullets. In Japan, some women are branching out and trying the \u201CMarubozu\u201D cut, a type of short cropped buzz. What kind of hairstyles would you be daring enough to try? \n\n#pandemic #pandemic2020 #hairstyle #haircolor #newyork #newyorkcity #hairtrends2020 #buzzcut #buzzcutgirl","NumberOfLikes":1,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598671581,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 29 05:26:21 CEST 2020","Location":"New York City, N.Y."},{"CaptionText":"Lumen landscapes...

Places that totally would be your jam as a couple. I mean, I\u2019m sure there are families that have rugged adventures with young kids but we\u2019re not one of them. Maybe one day when we can figure out how to not pack an entire truck for a beach day... Anywho, this place is it. \n.\n\nFor a slightly more adventurous family day trip (or carry in camping experience if being a super parent\/pack horse is your thing), consider Sombrio Beach. If the rocky dunes, bull whips, surf watching and tidal pools don\u2019t draw you in, the hidden waterfall certainly will. The trail upstream holds a likeness to escaping to another land through a hobbit hole. Breathtaking views await and the tide pools will pay dividends. \n.\n\nNow, this isn\u2019t a \u201Cpack up the @costco wagon and haul it down to the beach\u201D type of trip. Prepare yourself with a baby\/toddler carrier and backpack, picnic and water. The loose rock beach and steep trail may be a challenge for new walkers. Plan your visit during low tide, keep an eye on your littles, and be mindful of where the tide comes in so you don\u2019t get stranded on the other side of the beach away from the parking lot. \n.\n\nDo you have a favourite place that screams life before kids? \n.\n\n#pandemicparenting #localtourist #parkssmart @yourbcparks @hellobc #isolationrecreation @explorecanada #explorevancouverisland #vancouverisland #victoriabccanada #feminists #familytravel #travelwithkids #pandemic2020 #pandemictravel\n#homeschool #momlife #play #kidsactivities #preschoolactivities #learnthroughplay #playideas #momhack #kidsactivities  #momblog #motherhood #parenting #vancouver #yvrblogger #canadianblogger #vancouverblogger #westcoastfresh","NumberOfLikes":23,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598661719,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 29 02:41:59 CEST 2020","Location":"Juan de Fuca Provincial Park"},{"CaptionText":"Mesmo com toda a tristeza e pânico que essa pandemia nos trouxe, hoje estou  realizando o sonho de uma vida.

So far it's validating my diagnosis and symptoms in a huge way and it's validating a lot of the steps I've taken in trying to battle this chronic condition.  I am in a constant migraine cycle and have been since December of 2018 so at times I have felt so defeated, especially when talking to my LTD rep and at times my family Dr but I am doing what I can to try to get better - sometimes this condition just doesn't co-operate.  And all I can do is hope that one day it will.  I am looking forward to finished book and finding out more ways to try to break the migraine cycle and hopefully be on my way to getting my life back.  #vestibularmigraine #vestibularmigrainedisease #chronicillness #dizzy #dizzyfordayz #migrainewarrior\n#whatimreading #whatimreadingnow #readmore #2020goals #myyearofreading #myyearofreading2020 #readmorebooks #bookaddict #goodreads #andreasreadinglist2020 #andreasreadinglist #readersofinstagram","NumberOfLikes":12,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Andrea Tanner in Treaty No. 1.

So yeaaaa kinda had some crazy past 48 hrs lol. From what I managed to read up, my place is located 55 miles from Cameron,LA where the Eye of the hurricane, as well as the hurricane wall is... And this last one extends to 50 miles out, from the center of the hurricane... Which meant that my place was *barely* outside the hurricane force winds😬😬😬. I was not worried where I was staying\/had evacuated to (thanks sis, crazy night 😂) BUT when those winds really kicked up, I was worried I would not have a place left in the morning. Thankfully, the damages were mild to my area, and my place was unscathed. Electricity was down for about 24 hrs (which is reaaally not bad considering) and was fixed farely quickly. A huge thanks to those electrician guys who work on power lines and for the work they do. We had a crew who drove all the way from Georgia to help us. Hurricane Laura landed as a cat 4 hurricane... Nothing to be messing with. And on a more interesting note, I saw a sheriff being interviewed just before the storm hit, and he said he wasn't gonna worry about masks and social distancing because of what was coming... If you want more proof this \"virus\" has been blown out of proportion, look no further than a hurricane coming on shore... THAT is a real threat, not a virus with 99% survivability and 24\/7 media coverage to keep you in fear.\n\n#hurricaneseason #hurticanelaura #pandemic2020 #covid19 #covidscam #louisiana #cajun #cajuncountry #southwestlouisiana #survivor #extremeweather #hurricane #2020 #2020becrazy #donewith2020","NumberOfLikes":10,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":10,"Timestamp":1598642196,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 28 21:16:36 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"✨When your girl @dulcemakesart designs stickers and brings you not one...BUT TWO ✌🏻 they go immediately on the laptop!!!!✨\n*********** *********** *********** \nThen to top it off, we had to revel in the cuteness!

Music lifts our spirits & brings joy & comfort. Kids need to feel safe & happy all the time!\n\nQ: What motivated you when things may have felt impossible?\n\n» It was very important to me that my own children & my students keep continuity with piano lessons. My method is based on creating music & creating music is a magical journey. Nothing is impossible! Yes, it can be difficult at first but it is not impossible.\n\nQ: Biggest difficulty you had with teaching online?\n\n» I learned over years that life is always changing. I learned how to dance in the storm, this life skill I am teaching my kids & my students as well. Transition from in home to online lessons was difficult for me, I was not able to share hugs with my students or play piano duets & trios. But I quickly educated myself about online lessons in general & things started to go smoother.\n\nI have never taught piano lessons online before. My students are ages 3.5 and up. To engage little ones online was the biggest challenge for me. Luckily \"Stuck Inside Survival Guide\" was created right on time & my online lessons become super interesting for students of all ages. Thank you Stacey so much for creating it!\n\nQ: Favourite story of teaching online?\n\n» My students started to improve with sight reading a lot! I realized how they become more independent via online lessons. Usually, in home, I would step in right away if they are struggling with music notes but online I was not able to do it. That was my eye opening moment as a teacher. In May we had our very first Zoom Recital, that was exciting & new. I love how we had a big audience, friends & families zooming in from all over the world to show us support & enjoy performances. \"Show must go on!\"\n\n\u2022\n\nJoin the conversation!

The 15-year deal was signed in 2016 and was the largest deal in the history of college sport. The deal would give UCLA\u2019s student-athletes and personnel supply to exclusive Under Armour products.\n\nThe suit, filed Wednesday in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that Under Armour was struggling before Covid-19 and that it used the pandemic as a reason to get out of the deal. UCLA alleges the deal had become too expensive for the sportswear company and cites other issues at Under Armour, such as financial troubles.\n\nUnder Armour said in a statement June that it \"recently made the difficult decision to discontinue our partnership with UCLA, as we have been paying for marketing benefits that we have not received for an extended time period.\" Under Armour has commented that the company is upset with the lawsuit but plan to defend their stance. \n\nSource: CNN Business","NumberOfLikes":5,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Economic News Today on August 28, 2020.

Bahkan menurut Kepala UPTD Parkir Dishub Kota Banjarmasin, Hendra S Stp, MA, penurunan pemasukan perbulan hingga di bawah 50 persen dari waktu normal.\n\nIa mencontohkan, jika pada bulan-bulan sebelum terjadi Covid-19 pendapatan dari sektor pajak dan retribusi parkir berkisar di angka Rp800 juta hingga Rp900 juta. Namun sejak April 2020 jumlah tersebut merosot hingga hanya dikisaran Rp200 juta saja.\n\nMerosotnya pendapatan dari sektor tersebut ujar Hendra tak lepas dengan adanya sejumlah kebijakan Pemerintah Kota Banjarmasin yang menutup beberapa objek wisata dan pembatasan jumlah pengunjung tempat keramaian serta rumah makan.\n\n\u201CMisalnya penutupan Siring Pierre Tendean, Patung Bekantan dan beberapa objek lain.

Perhaps it is the lengthening nights and how I am almost out the door before light crests the day as I set out on my morning walks, witnessing the rising sun, the coloring of the clouds from deep pink to white. Or maybe it is rustle of autumn in the turning leaves...the official turn of season less than four weeks away. The shifting of seasons stirring a desire to hunker down and journey within. \n🌀\nIt has been over five months since walking replaced lap swimming. The intimacy I feel with my neighborhood has deepened. I have watched flowers bud, blossom, and die (I find the irises fascinating.) Trees go from bare to full leaf and, soon, those leaves will fall to earth and decay. I have encountered new neighbors. Some have shared the death of their beloved pets. Others simply their name. Some just wave.\n🌀\nTogether we have watched a grassy park go from orange barricaded \u201Cno-go zone\u201D to a social-distancing, but welcoming, fenced dog park. Learned to negotiate a new kind of sidewalk etiquette. And have become familiar with each others daily rhythms.\n🌀\nThis world we are in, this in-flux world, some days the transformations are in tiny increments and other days the change is sudden, like a tree cut down. Startling. \n🌀\nEach morning I set out I imagine I am embarking on a new journey. Because really, I am. Just like a river is never the same from moment to moment, neither is the path where I place my feet. The air has stirred the leaves. Birds have eaten seeds. Life has come and gone. Transformation. It is all around me. It is happening within me. I am in a daily pilgrimage through this season. \n🌀\nWhat is transforming in your life? What are you notice as the season is shifting? \n🌀\n@nurtureyourjourney\n#nutureyourjourney\n#transformation\n#pilgrimage\n#coping_with_covid19\n#pandemic2020 \n#grief_and_loss","NumberOfLikes":11,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1598586809,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 28 05:53:29 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"😍 #100HappyDays #Pandemic2020 #Camping #OnMyAdventureCalledLife #RedwoodTrees #TreeFort #VanessaAndMacArthur #RideOrDie","NumberOfLikes":15,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Vanessa Medina on August 27, 2020.

I used to think \"travel\" meant going across the ocean, on a plane, staying in a hotel and having an itinerary. That idea of travel isn't really sustainable, or even an option right now, so I've had to reinvent the way I define \"travel\".\n.\nI never wanted to \"go outside and play\". I don't like hot, cold, bugs, wind, or wet. I enjoy sitting. And eating and drinking are usually best done inside (and both of those happen to be hobbies of mine as well, in addition to sitting). But in the midst of this pandemic, I've been forced to spend more time in nature, and find ways to \"explore\" places that are untamed and un-reviewed on Yelp. I'm starting to understand why some people become \"outdoors enthusiasts\". Until you've been someplace outdoors, where you feel totally alone, small, and at peace, it doesn't click. It's starting to click for me, and I hope it already has for you.\n.\nSo I guess here's to thinking that the pandemic made me put \"travelling\" and \"exploring\" on hold. It just made me rediscover and reinvent what that looks like to me. Just as going for walks and baking bread were some of the first things I resorted to, it's been one of the first things I've let go of. I guess as we've gotten back into the busy-ness and \"reopening\" of things, I forgot to make time to do absolutely nothing, or try something new. I'm hoping that my new \"thirst\" for the outdoors continually reminds me that there's an endless list of things out there to be discovered, if I just make the time. \n\nLet's spend more time doing nothing. Or even better, doing nothing 𝘰𝘶𝘵𝘴𝘪𝘥𝘦.\n.\n.\n.\n#getoutandexplore #gooutsideandplay #goodtobealive #stateparks #pandemic2020 #willyoubemyquarantine #rediscoveryourself","NumberOfLikes":36,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by A L L I S O N 🔹 C O N N E R on August 27, 2020.

That number is even more pronounced locally in the Rio Grande Valley.\n\nWith that said, this retrospective study looked at patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) health system.\n\nResults:\n✅ 6916 patients with COVID-19\n✅ High BMI = Up to 4x mortality risk\n✅ Risk increases beginning with BMI 30\n✅ Severe obesity results in up to 4x risk\n✅ Being underweight increases mortality\n\nSo, poor eating habits will increase your risk of death if you get infected with the coronavirus!\n\nUnderstandably, everybody is starting to experience COVID-19 fatigue as we are approaching September.  Along with practicing the usual safety measures to prevent infection, it is just as important to also maintain healthy eating habits!  We may not have full control over who wears masks, who goes out, who believes in the pandemic, but we do have control over what goes into our bellies!

This is a major policy change since making the announcement back in 2012 of having the 2 percent inflation target. \n\nPowell says the policy change received unanimous approval. Central bank officials traditionally have believed that low unemployment leads to dangerously higher levels of inflation, and they\u2019ve moved preemptively to head it off.\n\nPowell contrasted what is happening in the economy today with what the feds faced 40 years ago. Ex-Chairman Paul Volcker made controversial policy decisions to put downward pressure to high inflation through a series of hikes in rates. Powell highlighted that the fundamentals of the economy has changed and that in recent times they have focused too heavily on having inflation run low.\n\nSince the end of the financial crisis, the Fed has struggled to hit its 2% inflation target. Officials hope that the new approach will change the landscape, raising expectations and allowing inflation to float higher as rates remain low.\n\nReported By: CNBC, Yahoo!

I haven't posted many photos of myself since lockdown started in March. When this global pandemic hit, all the beautiful and empowering self care I had worked towards, that took me decades to finally make my \"new normal\"...well I kind of tossed it all out the window. I allowed fear to take over me. I got sick and have been struggling to get back to the healthy version of me for months. It's hard to excercise when you are exhausted and recovering from whatever I had. \n.\n.\nThis has all led to major imposter syndrome. How can I possibly share about wellness if I am not walking the walk? How did I let myself go back down that path of unhealthy choices, I worked so hard to undo? \nDuring all of this, I have been trying to give myself grace and I have been  completely understanding as to why I have allowed myself to eat horribly, not excercise, not sleep enough etc etc. I have taken comfort in the fact that my reaction to this pandemic is a reaction of so many. So believe me when I say I am working hard to not wollow of feel sorry for myself. I KNOW how small changes can lead to HUGE results. I have, in my decades long struggle with body image and self hate, experienced incredible metamorphosis. If I have done it before, than I can do it again. \nI think all sizes are beautiful. I love all bodies. I think I am awesome, regardless of weight. So please know that this is not rooted in fatphobia. That being said, binge eating on junk food, not moving my body and occasionally drinking alcohol for months has resulted in me gaining a lot of weight. Enough for me to decide this morning, that enough is enough. I deserve better. I need to start properly loving myself again. As of today, while continuing to give myself grace, I am not going to make any more excuses. \nAs of today I am cutting out all the crap! \nI will start eating better again. I will start exercising again. I will stop binge watching Netflix. I will start reading books again. I will clean my home and enjoy the feeling of a clean space. \nI hit my breaking point this morning.

Needed to get back to see my mom after she had a fall.  Decided to take an isolated road trip across the country.  Journey through pandemic America.  Jumped off the 40 to check out some of the abandoned tourist attractions that dot historic, old Rt. 66 that was the byway of 1950\u2019s America.  I\u2019ve always been fascinated by old Rt. 66 and the family road trips that were so much a part of that era.  I have so many books on the subject and even outlined a time travel script set along Rt. 66.  Might pull that one out again.  In the meantime here are some shots I took near Winslow, AZ.  Big stretches of Rt. 66 literally run right along side the I 40. This long since abandoned motor court says it\u2019s coming back.

That's what I did yesterday during a photo walk through Harvard Square. I asked a fellow named Sang about his mask and he explained that his parents, who live in South Korea, had given him the mask EIGHT years ago because they were concerned about the air quality in the U.S. Little could they have known that the mask would later protect their son from something far more menacing than airborne pollutants. Sang went on to explain that when he rides his motorcycle with Mango, a Shibu Inu, tucked into his backpack, he wears a cloth face guard under his helmet for additional protection (swipe to view). I love hearing these mask backstories!

Sementara pembagian ditargetkan pembagian terhadap 15,7 juta pekerja penerima BSU tersebut tuntas hingga akhir September mendatang.\n\n\"Ini yang kita luncurkan hari ini 2,5 juta. Kami harapkan nanti di bulan September selesai 15,7 juta pekerja,\" kata Jokowi di Istana Negara, Jakarta.\n\nDijelaskan Jokowi, masing-masing pekerja yang menerima BSU senilai Rp 600ribu per bulan untuk selama empat bulan. Akan mendapatkan pencairan atau transer BSU per dua bulan sekali. Dengan besaran BSU yang diterima yakni senilai Rp 1,2juta.\n\n\"Sekali dua bulan akan ditransfer sebesar satu juta dua ratus ribu rupiah, jadi dalam empat bulan akan berlangsung sebanyak 2 kali transfer BSU,\" lanjutnya.\n\nPresiden Jokowi juga menjelaskan, para pekerja yang mendapatkan bantuan subsidi upah tersebut merupakan peserta aktif BPJS Ketenagakerjaan hingga Juni 2020. Menurut Jokowi, ini dilakukan sebagai bentuk penghargaan kepada perusahaan yang selama ini patuh membayar iuran BPJS Ketenagakerjaan.\n\nDengan diberikannnya bantuan ini, Jokowi berharap konsumsi rumah tangga masyarakat akan meningkat. Dengan demikian, hal tersebut bisa mendongkrak ekonomi Indonesia ke depannya.\n\n\"Semuanya terpengaruh dan itu di dalam angka-angka yang setiap pagi saya lihat, memang faktanya seperti itu. Oleh sebab itu, pemerintah mengeluarkan yang namanya stimulus ekonomi,\" kata Jokowi.**\n\n#bantuansubsidiupah \n#covid \n#pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":54,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by The Polites on August 26, 2020 tagging @jokowi, and @jokowi.amin.

Have criteria and must-haves in an ideal home or city you\u2019d like to move to.\u2063\n\u2063\n2. Research potential cities (especially demographics)!\u2063\nThis one was SO important for us. When you grow up in a community of color (usually close to major metro areas), it\u2019s hard to leave & go to some of the country\u2019s cheapest cities because of the culture shock & discomfort that can come from leaving such a diverse area with people like you. Most \u201Ccheapest cities in America\u201D lists don\u2019t consider this factor that is on the mind of many poc when confronted with the idea of moving somewhere cheaper. With a global pandemic also happening, there may be a high possibility that you may not be able to visit your desired city beforehand (we didn\u2019t). So researching any & all details you can is VITAL.\u2063\n\u2063\n3. Examine your finances & have a few months\u2019 worth of rent & utilities saved up. If you have a remote job\/client work coming with you, even better!\u2063\n\u2063\n4. Set a moving timeline once you pick a city to move to based on your needs. We chose a sooner timeline to maximize not spending money from going out haha.\u2063\n\u2063\n5. Don\u2019t compromise on what\u2019s important!! While you may be anxious to just get the process over with, don\u2019t give into anything that is a dealbreaker for you, especially if you\u2019re unable to visit potential homes before you move.\u2063\n\u2063\n6. Once you move, get ready to thrive! Lots of poc live in expensive metro areas because that\u2019s where our communities are highly concentrated. However, the pandemic is making us realize that if we can do what we do from home, then why do we need to kill ourselves trying to survive in an expensive city?\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\nListen to my moving audio diary & more in-depth moving tips on the latest episode of @empoweredincolor, available on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, & Spotify now!

I was so disturbed that I texted the message below to Kellogg\u2019s Consumer Affairs at 1-800-962-1413. \nHere is a copy of my text:\n\nDear Kellogg\u2019s Consumer Affairs,\nI am writing on behalf on the trio of waffles that were released for children. \n\nAs a Registered Dietitian, I am very concerned about the ingredients in these products being marketed as a breakfast option. In fact, I see this as a poor dessert option for any child. I believe the list of ingredients can have an adverse effect on a child's immune system. ( swipe left for the list of ingredients + a list of the adverse effects of food colors).\n\nFor example, all 3 waffles contain sugar as the third ingredient -wheat and water are the 1st and 2nd ingredient. The 4th ingredient is the worst of toxic oils-soybean, canola and\/or cottonseed oil. \n\nFinally, each brand contains at least 1-5 artificial colors.\nDr. Aristo Vojdani, an expert in food and environmental sensitivities, reported in the medical literature, these molecules of artificial food dyes, made from petroleum, are so small that they disrupt the immune systems ability to defend against these ingredients.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics issued a policy statement in 2018 explaining that artificial colors may harm children's health and are best to be avoided.\nThis is why they've been banned in many countries like Australia and Norway.\n\nCmon Kellogg's~ you can do better than this trio of toxic, processed foods for growing children during this pandemic. \nI urge you to recall these products and think deeply about some  nourishing breakfast ideas, using real food ingredients,  that our children so deserve. \nThank you,\nJeanne Peters RD\nNourishing Wellness Medical Center\n~~~~~~~~~\nIf you feel 😡 like me, use your personal power to call or text Kellogg\u2019s so they receive  the message these products are unacceptable for our children!!

Boa parte do grupo ainda cursa o ensino médio e se divide entre aulas e reuniões para fazer atos que desafiam parlamentares, governadores e ministros de Estado. \n\nAlguns têm pretensões eleitorais.\n\nO movimento aceita participantes de até 29 anos, mas os seus destaques estão na faixa de 17 a 20. Depois de dezenas de milhares deles irem às ruas na Europa em 2019 contra o aquecimento global, novos atos estão previstos em Bruxelas em setembro contra a ratificação do acordo de livre-comércio entre o Mercosul e a União Europeia, aposta do governo Jair Bolsonaro na área econômica.\n\nUm dos participantes do ato é o brasileiro Abel Rodrigues, que se mudou de Belém (PA) para Lisboa em 2018.
