Life is a test a battle against good and evil. Life is meant to serve God and God alone.

God said he placed us on this earth to worship him and indulge in his rememberence. \n\nYou never truly know what a person is going through. That is why we must treat people right.This is why i have changed my focus. I no longer let little things get to me, because i know everything is temporary. I am only attached to God and nothing else. I am awakened to the truth. I no longer let depression or anxiety win, because pain is temporary. God sees us and knows our struggles, and he is most merciful. \n\nGod signs are clear. He is taking souls. Celeberties billionaires the rich, famous, icons and legends. We belong to God and to him we must return. This year 2020 should be an awakening of how quick things can change. WE HAVE NO CONTROL GOD IS IN CONTROL. TRUST IN HIS PLAN.\n\nThe oppressors have but little time. They think they can rule. But it is only by God. We are on his time. And we will see his power. Remember GOD. remember death. PRAY.

In New York\u2019s hair salons, women are requesting fewer bangs and wispy styles to avoid touching their face often. Others are choosing styles that will look good even when grown out in case salons are forced to shut again. Hair stylists are being asked to apply their creativity in coming up with stylish yet practical solutions for corona-conscious clients!\n\nAs many people anticipate fewer social and professional interactions in person, they have seized the opportunity to experiment with funky and bold new hairstyles. On some we have seen exciting pinks and greens, and on others we have seen mohawks and mullets. In Japan, some women are branching out and trying the \u201CMarubozu\u201D cut, a type of short cropped buzz. What kind of hairstyles would you be daring enough to try? \n\n#pandemic #pandemic2020 #hairstyle #haircolor #newyork #newyorkcity #hairtrends2020 #buzzcut #buzzcutgirl","NumberOfLikes":0,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598671581,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 29 05:26:21 CEST 2020","Location":"New York City, N.Y."},{"CaptionText":"Lumen landscapes...

What happens when isolation is also a public health mandate?\nIn a recent poll, nearly 40% of American adults reported that their mental health has been negatively affected by the pandemic. Another sobering report indicated that beyond the 100,000 people who have already died from COVID-19 in\nthe U.S., as many as 75,000 more could die what\u2019s termed \u201Cdeaths of despair\u201D\u2014 from substance abuse or suicide \u2014as a result of the consequences of the pandemic, both social and economic. Those numbers are unthinkable.\nBut anyone, been in therapy or even just had an honest conversation with a trusted friend can tell you that one of the most vital resources available to us is connection: the simple, radical act of piercing the divide between the frightened, insular self and the people around us who might seek to understand. There\u2019s a difference between a grainy face on a screen and the embrace of a loved one. In order to be truly vulnerable, we need to be felt.\n\nFor me, the tools that I relied upon to feel well often looked less like treatment and more like the ingredients that make up a full, joyful life: the friends I saw for long, intimate dinners; the work events that made me feel purposeful and accomplished; even the affirming gym I went to in the mornings, which had as much body diversity as anyone.\n\nThis is the problem that confronts many of the people who are living through this epidemic alone: our only company right now may be our demons.\n\nPicture and text borrowed from:\nTime 22 - 29, June 2020\/ Stuck with yourself by Sam Lansky\n.\n\n#covid19 #coronavirus #virus #disease #loneliness #pandemic #pandemic2020 #pandemicoronavirus2020","NumberOfLikes":1,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Anjani Kumar Tripathi on August 28, 2020.

On the field, there were about 20-30 disc golfers who were enjoying themselves, playing on the only disc golf course at a baseball stadium in the country. \n\nDisc golf is a rising sport on the Gulf Coast with the Pensacola and Mobile areas having over 40 disc golf courses and hundreds of players.  One of those players is Wahoos co-owner and two-time Master\u2019s Winner Bubba Watson, from nearby Milton, FL. He is an avid disc golf player, who often plays on his downtime while on the road during PGA Tour stops.  Watson helped design the 9-hole course at Blue Wahoos Stadium, with input from his family and Wahoos Group Sales Executive Greg Liebbe, who has played disc golf for over 10 years. \n\nThe makeshift course is only open Friday thru Sunday for now, but it has already become a big hit in the community.  The course sees a couple hundred players on any given weekend, with the stadium\u2019s signature hole being at home plate, where players throw from the pitcher\u2019s mound to the basket.  The stadium also has several long outfield holes where you throw from deep center field to a basket at second base, and from near shortstop to a basket in deep left field.\n\n\u201CWhen they threw the idea out, I said: hey let\u2019s do it! I\u2019m a bit of disc golf nut, you could say\u201D mentioned Bubba Watson.\n\nPandemic Disc Golf Apparel. High quality materials and craftmsmanship with outstanding customer support.

It became resounded,rather unfortunately, the certitude of the varied shapes and sizes adversity can come in; the  fact that fierce adversity can come branded with ordinary names like 'pandemic', this pandemic.\n\nIn the past few months, we have woken up everyday to the gory realizations of what this pandemic can be; what unimaginable harm it seeks to achieve. We hear of the numerous human lives that are brought to an end everyday.We face the compulsory closure of schools, markets, workplaces, worship places, compulsory use of face masks, and so on. More and more people die of hunger as the days go by and the world keeps waning into deeper darkness. Each time, many of us wonder if this is end that was long foretold.\n\nIn Nigeria, the situation presents itself as confusion. The figures given of the infected persons increase on a daily basis, yet we find it very difficult to see people coughing heavily and having difficulty in breathing. We only see people dying of insecurity, people dying of lack of basic amenities, people striving to survive in the face of hardship. We only see a fire consumed accountant general's office and records about public funds that burnt into ashes or rather, grew wings and flew away. The type of fight we put up abounds with a scepticism that tarries even though there has been formal announcements by the media of people who really have contracted and died of the virus, a situation not quite strange in a land which has suffered endless years of deceit and bad governance like ours. We still stay safe in our own way, many of us thriving in that subtle belief borne out of helplessness and monumental primitivism- the belief that what a man does not know about cannot harm him.\n\nContinued in comment......\n\n#writersofinstagram #write #pandemic #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":6,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Anekwe Kingsley Chukwuebuka on August 28, 2020 tagging @_danielobum, @chimamanda_adichie, @alexandernewman1234, @dyster1, and @apotheosisarthouse.","NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1598648417,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 28 23:00:17 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Happy happy #nationalredwineday!!

Believe it or not, nearly 40 years ago the cult classic \u201CGrease 2\u201D rama-lama-lama-ka-dinga-da-ding-dong\u2019d its way onto the silver screen. To kick off the weekend, today\u2019s stop on my pandemic Hollywood tour is the burger joint featured in the film! \n\n\u201CGrease 2\u201D is a sequel to the 1978 film \u201CGrease.\u201D It takes place two years after the original film at Rydell High School, set in the 1961\u20131962 school year, with an almost entirely new cast, led by actors Maxwell Caulfield and Michelle Pfeiffer in her first starring role.\n\nIn the film, Michael Carrington (Maxwell Caulfield) tutored Stephanie Zinone (Michelle Pfeiffer) over a hamburger (with extra ketchup!) at the local burger joint. In real life, this 50\u2019s style eatery is called Cadillac Jack\u2019s Diner and it was built in 1949. \n\nOriginally named the Pink Cafe, the diner is no longer a working restaurant. It stopped serving food in 1989 and is exclusively a filming set that production companies rent out. Cadillac Jack\u2019s Diner is located at \u202A9457 San Fernando Road in Sun Valley\u202C, CA. \n\nThis diner has appeared in numerous movies and TV shows including The House of Sand and Fog, High Road, and Pirates of Silicon Valley, as well as in episodes of Columbo, Las Vegas, Highway to Heaven, Murder, She Wrote, Law & Order, and Simon & Simon. Recently, the locale has been used in many music videos including Mandy Moore\u2019s Candy, Cee Lo Green\u2019s Forget You,  Hailey Reinhart\u2019s Free, and Christina Aguilera\u2019s Your Body videos.\n\nFun facts - The pink cabinet outside of the Diner, that Johnny and Goose knee and punch, was made specifically for the film and was not a part of Cadillac Jack's, where the scene was filmed.\n\nReportedly, Maxwell Caulfield won the lead male role over Shaun Cassidy, Greg Evigan, Andy Gibb, and Rick Springfield.\n\nLisa Hartman, Kristy McNichol, Andrea McArdle and Pat Benatar were considered for the role of Stephanie Zinone. Michelle Pfeiffer was a wild card choice, but according to Patricia Birch, she won the part because she \u201Chas a quirky quality you don\u2019t expect.\" #filminglocation  #grease2 #cadillacjacksdiner #sunvalley #hollywoodtour #pandemic2020 #socialdistancing #wearamask #tonymiros","NumberOfLikes":46,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1598635153,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 28 19:19:13 CEST 2020","Location":"Cadillac Jack's"},{"CaptionText":"SWIPE➡️\nWeren\u2019t we suppose to already be this way ? \nWe were suppose to be and were asked by many to be prepared and ready to fight and exists along such Pandemic🚧🦠🧪💉\n\nBut again what has happened has happened and the world is now gaining it\u2019s senses again and trying to heal in terms of business⚰️🤯\n\nBeing Pandemic proof will come in handy in the future as the world will comeback to its original reigns and it will be a more better and a healthy financial environment if god forbid we are hit with such pandemic again🤦🏻\u200D♂️⛑🎯\n\nLet\u2019s Be Better And Let\u2019s Get Pandemic Proof for A Healthier Future to Come💪🏼💫💸💰\n.\n.\nFollow : @mentalhigh.in \n  @mentalhigh.in \n  @mentalhigh.in \n  @mentalhigh.in \n.\n.\n#mentalhigh #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife #covid2019 #essentialworkers #futurebusinessowner #pandemicproof #proof #humankind #lockdownindia #economic #economiccollapse #businessconsultant #businessbranding #pandemicorona #diseaseprevention #diseasefree #investorswanted #startupadvice #worldawakening #awarenessiskey #financialhealth #coronavirusoutbreak⚠️ #worldhealthorganization #usa🇺🇸💖 #india🇮🇳 #jio #amazonindia #betterfuture #positivityiskey","NumberOfLikes":155,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1598635103,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 28 19:18:23 CEST 2020","Location":"New York, New York"},{"CaptionText":"Mike Fox Skate Park. \nSanta Cruz California.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n#skateboard #skate #mikefoxskatepark #santacruzskateboards #pandemic2020 #shelterinplace #tonyperez #tonyperezphotographs #skaterboy #dearevanhansen","NumberOfLikes":5,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by TONY PEREZ PHOTOGRAPHS on August 28, 2020.

Some decided to fling them off the bridge whereas others gathered on the riverbed for the traditional immersion on the occasion of Gauri Visarjan. While the cops have been trying their best to shoo away these enthusiasts by not allowing them to immerse the idol in the riverbed near Shaniwar Peth and Deccan areas, the citizens are equally stern on following the tradition. They want to let the idol flow with the water as they have been doing so for generations. The sneakiest of the lot preferred to toss the idols off the bridge joining Shaniwar Peth.

Perhaps it is the lengthening nights and how I am almost out the door before light crests the day as I set out on my morning walks, witnessing the rising sun, the coloring of the clouds from deep pink to white. Or maybe it is rustle of autumn in the turning leaves...the official turn of season less than four weeks away. The shifting of seasons stirring a desire to hunker down and journey within. \n🌀\nIt has been over five months since walking replaced lap swimming. The intimacy I feel with my neighborhood has deepened. I have watched flowers bud, blossom, and die (I find the irises fascinating.) Trees go from bare to full leaf and, soon, those leaves will fall to earth and decay. I have encountered new neighbors. Some have shared the death of their beloved pets. Others simply their name. Some just wave.\n🌀\nTogether we have watched a grassy park go from orange barricaded \u201Cno-go zone\u201D to a social-distancing, but welcoming, fenced dog park. Learned to negotiate a new kind of sidewalk etiquette. And have become familiar with each others daily rhythms.\n🌀\nThis world we are in, this in-flux world, some days the transformations are in tiny increments and other days the change is sudden, like a tree cut down. Startling. \n🌀\nEach morning I set out I imagine I am embarking on a new journey. Because really, I am. Just like a river is never the same from moment to moment, neither is the path where I place my feet. The air has stirred the leaves. Birds have eaten seeds. Life has come and gone. Transformation. It is all around me. It is happening within me. I am in a daily pilgrimage through this season. \n🌀\nWhat is transforming in your life?

I used to think \"travel\" meant going across the ocean, on a plane, staying in a hotel and having an itinerary. That idea of travel isn't really sustainable, or even an option right now, so I've had to reinvent the way I define \"travel\".\n.\nI never wanted to \"go outside and play\". I don't like hot, cold, bugs, wind, or wet. I enjoy sitting. And eating and drinking are usually best done inside (and both of those happen to be hobbies of mine as well, in addition to sitting). But in the midst of this pandemic, I've been forced to spend more time in nature, and find ways to \"explore\" places that are untamed and un-reviewed on Yelp. I'm starting to understand why some people become \"outdoors enthusiasts\". Until you've been someplace outdoors, where you feel totally alone, small, and at peace, it doesn't click. It's starting to click for me, and I hope it already has for you.\n.\nSo I guess here's to thinking that the pandemic made me put \"travelling\" and \"exploring\" on hold. It just made me rediscover and reinvent what that looks like to me. Just as going for walks and baking bread were some of the first things I resorted to, it's been one of the first things I've let go of. I guess as we've gotten back into the busy-ness and \"reopening\" of things, I forgot to make time to do absolutely nothing, or try something new. I'm hoping that my new \"thirst\" for the outdoors continually reminds me that there's an endless list of things out there to be discovered, if I just make the time. \n\nLet's spend more time doing nothing. Or even better, doing nothing 𝘰𝘶𝘵𝘴𝘪𝘥𝘦.\n.\n.\n.\n#getoutandexplore #gooutsideandplay #goodtobealive #stateparks #pandemic2020 #willyoubemyquarantine #rediscoveryourself","NumberOfLikes":33,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by A L L I S O N 🔹 C O N N E R on August 27, 2020.

That number is even more pronounced locally in the Rio Grande Valley.\n\nWith that said, this retrospective study looked at patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) health system.\n\nResults:\n✅ 6916 patients with COVID-19\n✅ High BMI = Up to 4x mortality risk\n✅ Risk increases beginning with BMI 30\n✅ Severe obesity results in up to 4x risk\n✅ Being underweight increases mortality\n\nSo, poor eating habits will increase your risk of death if you get infected with the coronavirus!\n\nUnderstandably, everybody is starting to experience COVID-19 fatigue as we are approaching September.  Along with practicing the usual safety measures to prevent infection, it is just as important to also maintain healthy eating habits!  We may not have full control over who wears masks, who goes out, who believes in the pandemic, but we do have control over what goes into our bellies!

The 2020 medal for the fight against coronavirus in Russia and other countries is primarily eligible for:\n⚪ Doctors and healthcare professionals;\n⚪ Employees of the Ministry of Emergency Situations, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Defense and other law enforcement agencies;\n⚪ Volunteers;\n⚪ And other categories of citizens.\n⠀\nWhat makes this Covid medal unique? It has a number of unique features that set it apart from most other coronavirus awards that various organizations plan to issue:\n⠀\n✅ The only universal medal: it is suitable not only for medical professionals, but also for representatives of any other services and departments. Precisely for reasons of universality, the designers of the Factory of Rewards, when developing the concept of the medal, abandoned the image of the Red Cross and other medical symbols. There are no analogues of such a medal either in Russia or abroad. If desired, a certificate with the signature and seal of the award commission is supplied with the medal \"for the fight against Covid\".\n⠀\n✅ The only international medal: The universal design of this Covid19 award is suitable for any country in the world;\n⠀\n✅ The only personalized medal: because the text is laser-engraved on the permanent stamped base of the pandemic award, it can be produced individually for each member of even large teams. Thus, each fighter with coronavirus will receive his own award separately.\n⠀\n❗ You can order the medal for dedication in the fight against the pandemic only from the official manufacturer - the Factory of Awards company.\n⠀\nWe can use laser engraving to apply any inscription and decor on the obverse and reverse of the medal❗\n⠀\nMedal cost: 6$ (\u203C Discounts from quantity\u203C)\n⠀\n#covid #coronavirus #covid19 #covid19 #coronavirus #pandemic #covid_19 #medicine #covid #coronavirus2020 #pandemic2020 #thankstodoctors #corona #pandemiccovid #coronavirus pandemic #medal #award #order #cup #victory #coinsmedal #gift #numismatics #badges #stamping #medals #souvenir","NumberOfLikes":2,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Фабрика Наград on August 27, 2020.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598560499,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 27 22:34:59 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Definitely once in a lifetime experiences right now 😷 stay safe, stay healthy!\nThank you @lmonsivais for the masks!\nRepresenting @matisyahu gear on \n________________________________________\n#pandemic #pandemic2020 #coronavirus #stayhealthy #staysafe #mask #matisyahu #oneday","NumberOfLikes":107,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Chase Castillo, M.D. in Baltimore, Maryland.

Baseados em produtos e projetos locais, que vão de açaí a cosméticos, pequenos negócios inovadores começam a transformar o cenário regional.\n\nA economia verde, ou de baixo carbono, deve ajudar a região amazônica - que representa cerca de 60% do território brasileiro - a dar um salto em sua participação no Produto Interno Bruto (PIB), hoje de apenas 8%, segundo avaliação de especialistas no tema.\n\nO caminho trilhado por um número crescente de startups amazônicas para essa nova economia envolve comunidades ribeirinhas, indígenas, quilombolas e agricultores familiares. A lógica está em aplicar ciência e tecnologia a dezenas de ativos da região desde o início da cadeia de produção para aumentar o valor dos produtos e beneficiar as populações locais.\n\nFabricante de cosméticos feitos com óleos extraídos de plantas da região, a startup Biozer se prepara para exportar seus produtos para os Estados Unidos, Emirados Árabes e Europa. Já o Café Agroflorestal de Apuí utiliza grãos de plantações em áreas sombreadas pela floresta e será enviado para a Alemanha.

Restricted funeral attendance, restricted hugs and contact - and an even bigger need for connection.

And something positive happened amidst the crisis: friends and family from across the globe could 'attend' services here in Edmonton and area that they would have otherwise been unable to attend. Hugs are virtual, but connection is real. \n\nSince the world came to a stop in March 2020, Park Memorial has live-streamed 145 services for our families, and those services have been viewed a total of 26, 652 times.\n\nWe are learning new skills to offer bereaved families options for connection during Corona\u2026 because we understand that what grieving families need most is connection, compassion, and the ability to mourn together, no matter the miles nor the circumstances that divide.\n\n#parkmemorialcares #COVID19 #pandemic2020 #connectionsmatter #yeggrief #livestreaming","NumberOfLikes":2,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598546905,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 27 18:48:25 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"www.hgsolution.com.tr\nWeb sitemizi ziyaret etmeyi unutmayınız.\n\n#dezenfektan #pulvarize #disinfectant #dezenfektanstandı #atesolcerlidezenfekrankabini #hassas #püskürtme #sensor #covid19 #pandemic2020 #follow","NumberOfLikes":18,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598546904,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 27 18:48:24 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":".\nدوست داشتن کسی که معنی دوست داشتنت را نفهمد، \nدرست مثل توضیح دادن قانون نسبیت برای مادربزرگت است، \nتو چانه می\u200Cزنی و او بافتنی\u200Cاش را می\u200Cبافد...\n\n👤آلبرت انیشتین\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#دانشگاه_تهران #پردیس_مرکزی #دانشجو #کنکور #کنکور_تجربی #دانشگاه_علوم_پزشکی_تهران #علوم_پزشکی #دانشکده_پرستاری #زندگی #پرستاری #مامایی #دندانپزشکی #دندان_پزشکی #کرونا #من_ماسک_میزنم #کووید۱۹ #پزشک #روز_پزشک #داروساز\n#universityoftehran #university_of_tehran #tehranuniversity\n#tehran_university_of_medical_sciences\n#corona #coronavirus #covid19 #pandemic #pandemic2020 #epidemic","NumberOfLikes":576,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by دانشگاه علوم پزشکی تهران in Tehran University of Medical Science\/دانشکده پزشکی تهران.

So when our 2 push lawn mowers gave out right at the BEGINNING of summer 😅😭, we stressed about it. Well, I stressed about it and stressed my poor husband about it. We contemplated going against @daveramsey\u2019s advice and going into MORE debt just to get an actually decent riding lawn mower (we have a pretty big lawn), contemplated just creating a budget for paying someone to come do it every week (like at LEAST 200 a month) and even begging my mom for help. \n\u2022\n\u2022\nBut God stepped in. Our next door neighbor is selling his house. Our lawn had been overgrowing for QUITE A WHILE. It\u2018a been bad, y\u2019all. About 2 months ago, I was standing in the kitchen, making lunch for my sons when I heard a knock at the door. I immediately scooted around the island to hide my pantless body and yelled downstairs to ask my husband to get the door.

Sure, our lawn next to his may have scared off a few potential buyers, but I\u2019m sure he would still sell it. And we REALLY needed the help.

We would not like to endanger anyone due to our celebration. It is only wise to wait for the vaccine.\u201D\n\nShe further added, \u201CThis was inevitable. There\u2019s nothing we could do to control this, so we took a sensible decision. In the second week of March itself, we had decided that we won\u2019t get married in these conditions. People traveling would face a health risk and safety is most important right now\u201D.\n\n#richachadha #alifazal #richaali #pandemic2020 #EastFM #EastFmKenya #RadioAfrica","NumberOfLikes":31,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by East FM Kenya on August 26, 2020.

Even for living in California that\u2019s a lot for one person! 😱 I quickly decided $200 was better. But I kept going over budget for months and wasn\u2019t eating out or doing anything special and I had no rollover money. So I decided $250 was better since I also take household items from this budget. I successfully stayed under budget by $0.41 this month! Hey, a win is a win. 😅\n.\nBut I also decided to reevaluate again and that $300 is now a number I\u2019m comfortable with and it would be nice to have some rollover money at the end of the month.🤓\n.\nMy point is that budgets are a work in progress! You have to find an amount that is reasonable for your lifestyle but not so strict that you\u2019re regularly going over it. If that happens it\u2019s time to re-evaluate your spending habits or the amount you budget for that category. It takes some trial and error until you get to a place you\u2019re happy with! ☺️\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n*cashless tracker seen is from The Budget Mom.","NumberOfLikes":8,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Emerald, PA-S on August 26, 2020.","NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598501706,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 27 06:15:06 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Ngopi dulu sebelum jalan 🚘 #coffeelover #coffeetime #hotcapuccino☕ #visitlabuanbajo #bersyukur😇 #socialdistancing2020 #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":3,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Elys in Starbucks Coffee Labuanbajo.

The upside of all this is that it has been a time given to us to GROW.

I\u2019ve started back a book I\u2019ve been working on for years, and feel my creative juices flowing like never before. I hope you can also get back to something you\u2019d lost within yourself.

Homeschooling is something that OTHER families do. It seems like a nice idea, but it\u2019s definitely not my jam. Yet, here we are\u2026\n.\n.\nI feel like this homeschooling thing is my whole life right now. I could have sent my kids back to school with their friends, at their private school, which we do in fact love and miss. Alternatively, I could\u2019ve enrolled them in our local school district, and even chosen an online option. Neither of these choices felt quite right, not right now. \n.\n.\nThe way we\u2019re doing this is so hands-on, and intimate, and strangely satisfying. Granted, the feelings of satisfaction aren\u2019t QUITE as intense when I\u2019m breaking up a squabble or LITERALLY BEGGING someone to pay attention, but mostly, it\u2019s just\u2026 good.\n.\n.\nWe are laughing, and learning, and making memories. I\u2019m spending a great deal of time reading to my kids every day. I\u2019ve been so inspired by @readaloudrevival, and I\u2019m completely psyched about the fact that I have time and freedom to give my kids the gift of some incredible read-aloud experiences this school year.\n.\n.\nBig props also to @MasterBooks. We\u2019re really loving their Christ-centered curricula. It\u2019s a perfect fit for our family and the kids\u2019 learning styles.\n.\n.\nIt\u2019s a messy, weird time. I don\u2019t really know what the right answers are when it comes to moving beyond this pandemic-mindset. What I do know for sure, is that I can\u2019t really fathom regretting the moments that we\u2019re going to share together, as a family, this school year. \n.\n.\n.\n#homeschool #homeschooling #pandemichomeschool #pandemic2020 #backtoschool #bts2020 #homeschoollife #masterbooks #readaloudrevival #readaloud #homeschoolmom #homeschoolfamily #homeschoolmama","NumberOfLikes":50,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Crissy Page in Chillicothe, Ohio with @masterbooks, and @readaloudrevival.

It came to me in the shower 🚿 (where we all do our best thinking, right?) I was thinking about quilting and how this year has brought so many growing pains for me, as it has for so many others. But it\u2019s also brought me this creative outlet: sewing. I\u2019ve found a lot of joy in it! And I feel like so many people have their own 2020 stories to tell. We are all in this very same pandemic\/political\/economical\/emotional tornado 🌪  but our stories are varied and nuisanced and painted differently. Instagram only tells a piece. Sometimes though, a piece is enough. Sometimes it\u2019s the most important piece to tell. Sometimes when you start with a piece, the rest of the story begins to flow. \n\nI\u2019m going to sew another quilt. But with this one I need help. The quilt is going to tell a story about this year. And it needs your piece. ❤️ \n\nSend me a piece of fabric. But theres a catch....it can\u2019t just be any piece. I want this piece of fabric to have significance. I want it to tell part of your 2020 story. It can be from a shirt, a onesie, a blanket, a curtain, a towel...6.5 inches by 6.5 inches. It\u2019s just a piece, but maybe in sharing that one piece, your story takes a new perspective. Maybe it helps you let go. Maybe it\u2019s something that fills you with joy, or pain, or laughter, or anger or love. If you choose to send me one, feel free to include why you choose that piece of fabric. Or not! I respect that sometimes things are just personal and private and\u2014especially if I only know you marginally,\u2014it might feel uncomfortable to share. I also know that sometimes sharing with people you only know marginally is helpful- when we say things out loud or on paper it doesn\u2019t make them so daunting...or it makes them bigger! Or more funny! Or whatever! Sometimes it\u2019s good to share. Either way, I want your piece of fabric. Because otherwise this 2020 #storyquilt won\u2019t happen. And I think it needs to. \n\nIf you\u2019re serious about sending, DM me and I\u2019ll give you details on where to send. I probably need a deadline, so let\u2019s go with September 30. \n\nThanks for indulging me. I really hope you choose to share! 🧵❤️ (otherwise this shower idea 💡 just goes down the drain...)","NumberOfLikes":7,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Kbfrank94 on August 26, 2020.","NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598483592,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 27 01:13:12 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"2020 weddings be like. 😷💐 \/\/ \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#pandemic2020 #pandemicwedding #richandtammy #maskchic #neverfullydressedwithoutamask","NumberOfLikes":84,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by b. in Aberfoyle Mill with @jordan.larocque.

But of course all these got shut down too.\n.\nBut we pressed on anyway. I shared online, friends shared. And this little business that could just kept chugging along.\n.\nSo today we celebrate! In fact all week we celebrate because God is faithful! Because in the midst of the impossible, we press on and we are growing.\n.\nGod is good, y'all! He is good! So we celebrate as a testimony to Him!\n.\nAll this week take 15% off your entire order. Use code: 6Months\n.\nLink in my profile\/comments.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#makersgonnamake #makersofinstagram #smallbusinessowners #stickerlover #stickershop #stickersforsale #boutiqueshopping #onlineboutique #covid19 #pandemic2020 #overcomer #anniversary #birthdayfun #birthdayparty #bibleverseoftheday #heisgood #godisgood","NumberOfLikes":1,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Dandelion Inspired on August 26, 2020.

Although we were all at home and safe, the situation out there and the uncertainty was enough to worry you at all times. While we were managing with our new routines, and feelings as to what will happen next, it was equally important to keep the kids busy and positive at the same time.\n\nHaving a 7 and 11 year old, they had questions\/concerns and when re-opening of school kept getting delayed, they were not happy. As my younger one would ask me: \u2018When will corona end?\u2019 (I wish I knew!)\n\nTrying to focus on the positive has helped me keep my sanity these past months. I consciously try to remind myself and my kids how \u2018blessed\u2019 we are and how we have so much to be thankful for.\n\nWhen the kids starting making these lists, they had comments like: \u2018but we can\u2019t go out\u2019 and \u2018we can\u2019t even meet our friends\u2019... but in all that was going on in their little minds, they managed to find a lot they were grateful for ❤️\n\nWhat are you grateful for today??\n\nI just want to add that I know that this pandemic has not been easy on many around the world, and I hope and pray for everyone who\u2019s suffering that may Allah make things easy for you. Ameen.\n\nLove and prayers always 💖\n\n#pandemic2020 #pandemiclife #gratitude #thankful #momlife #momsofinstagram #parentsupport #parentingchallenges #markham #toronto #gta","NumberOfLikes":23,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Rubab Ali in Markham, Ontario.
