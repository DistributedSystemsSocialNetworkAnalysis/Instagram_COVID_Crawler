School is now in session. Today's story is about an unrecognized black hero named Henrietta Lacks. Her immortal life would save countless lives and change scientific research forever. \u2063\n\u2063\nHenrietta, 31, married mother of 5 was born in the 1920's. She suffered from cervical cancer.\u2063 \u2063\nDuring a visit to the John Hopkins Center for treatment, her body was looted. Her cervical cells stolen and used for research without her consent. Later these mind blowing cells called HeLa cells would become the first human biological material to be bought and sold world wide. This discovery  launched a multi-billion-dollar industry all of which Henrietta and her family would never be compensated for.\u2063\n\u2063\nPrior to her cells being harvested, cells studied outside of the human body would die after only a few cellular divisions. This made it nearly impossible for any substantial research to be conducted. However, Henrietta's miraculous cells divided endlessly therefore becoming immortal. \u2063\n\u2063\nBefore HeLa cells a woman would receive a hysterectomy for something as simple as a bacterial infection. Now let that sink in. \u2063\n\u2063\nSome 70,000 studies have been published involving the use of HeLa cells and they are in widespread use throughout the field of immunology. At least two Nobel Prizes have been awarded recently for research involving HeLa cells, one on the link between human papilloma virus and cervical cancer (2008 by Harald zur Hausen), which was shared with the discoverers of HIV (Luc Montagnier and Francoise Barre-Sinoussi), and the other into the part played by the telomerase enzyme in preventing chromosome degradation (2009 by Elizabeth Blackburn, Carol Greider and Jack Szostak).\u2063\n\u2063\nSource: British Science for Immunology. \u2063\n\u2063\nA few notable scientific breakthroughs as a result of the HeLa cell:\u2063\n\u2063\n1.) Cancer research.\u2063\n2.) Polio cure.\u2063\n3.) Gene mapping.\u2063\n4.) Chromosome counting.\u2063\n5.) Created the field of virology. \u2063\n6.) HPV vaccines....and the list goes on.\n\n#henreittalacks #science #Immunology #genemapping #blackhistory #HeLa #cancerresearch #blacklivesmatter #BLM #knowyourhistory","NumberOfLikes":7,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1591795839,"LocalDate":"Wed Jun 10 15:30:39 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Many of us do not know our history so we are destined to repeat it.
