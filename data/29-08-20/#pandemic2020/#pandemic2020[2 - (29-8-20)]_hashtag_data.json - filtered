According to the plan, the first priority should be given to the healthcare workers and then to adults with more than 65 years of age and those having health ailments as chronic respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer or obesity. The distribution of vaccines ought to be first made proportionally to all nations and then considering the vulnerability of their populations.\n\nThe WHO has recently proposed the global vaccine procurement programme under the name of 'COVAX' which will lead to acceleration of the development and manufacturing of vaccines and also  guarantee their fair and equitable access to all nations. \u201CUnder the COVAX Facility, we propose allocating vaccines in two phases. In phase 1, doses will be allocated proportionally to all participating countries simultaneously to reduce overall risk,\" said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director General of WHO. \u201CIn phase 2, consideration will be given to countries in relation to threat and vulnerability.\"\n\nMany countries are planning to or have already set up expert committees to decide on the next tier of distribution of the limited amount of vaccines that will initially be available before mass production.\n\n\u201CAs new diagnostics, medicines and vaccines become available, it\u2019s critical that countries don\u2019t repeat the mistakes early on when some of them hoarded supplies (of PPE kits),\" said Tedros.

That was the last trip I took the NYC before the virus had spread so much that New York State issued an emergency self-isolation protocol and everyone began working from home.\n\nThat's when I wondered, as an architect with product design capabilities, how can I help? A handful of my friends expressed the same question and I remember talking to @archivalley about this question.\n\nThe day after we discussed different ways I could help, I discovered a forum for makers to connect and fabricate products to help protect our medical professionals from the virus. I met a gentleman named Jacob B. who generously donated his time and 3D printer to make the visor portions of face shields. He was looking for someone with a laser cutter to make the face shield parts so he can assemble and deliver the final face shields to hospitals. The rest was history.\n\nOne day later, I shipped the laser cut PETG face shields to Jacob. Jacob assembled them and delivered them to hospitals.\n\nAll of this started from a simple question, how can I help? \n\nSo, how can I help? What are you helping with?

The don\u2019t just drive buses. At their discretion, they give homeless people somewhere warm to sleep. They provide security for night shift workers against people who have had too much to drink and are acting aggressively. I have seen bus drivers stop buses and get out of their seat to help older people on and off the bus, to intervene when women are sexually harassed, to sit down with their phone and help people who are lost get home when the other passengers don\u2019t care enough to help. .\n\nIn April 2020, TFL\u2019s director of bus operations, Claire Mann stated her devastation at the deaths of TFL employees But then she said the \u201Cvery latest scientific advice\u201D was that PPE was \u201Cnot required in non-care settings and could be counter-productive.\u201D In my opinion I lay the blame of TFL employees squarely at their employers feet. .\n\nDuring June 2020, when pandemic lockdown restrictions were easing I started looking for a new job and taking buses again with the knowledge of at least 23 London Bus drivers had died due to contracting Covid-19. I was pleased to see that bus drivers had finally been given protection. .\n\nAlso by this time it was made compulsory for passengers to wear face masks on public transport and I witnessed a new set of challenges for bus drivers. They are now left solely responsible for enforcing masks on the buses and also refusing passengers when the bus is full. Whilst doing this, I\u2019ve witnessed horrific verbal abuse from people who are challenged by the drivers on not wearing masks. This abuse has extended to racist slurs and ever banging on the barrier and kicking the drivers door. I have been disgusted by the reaction of the general public towards the men and women who are providing a key service. .\n\nIs standing outside and clapping once a week your maximum capacity to care? .\n\nThis series is dedicated to Mervyn Mally Kennedy. .\n\n#transportforlondon #tfl #covid19 #pandemic #lockdown #lockdownlondon #pandemic2020 #mervynmallykennedy #londonbusdrivers  #lockdownlife #f","NumberOfLikes":24,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by FIXPHOTO on August 25, 2020.

For me it is having the time to enjoy the simple things in life, from watching nature change into its finest clothing has been a real joy, it has allowed a sense of connection with nature and wildlife on a deeper level. The time to share a chat with neighbours that we hardly ever spoke to before and the real camaraderie of sharing and helping one another is one that I hope will last into the future, it has been so comforting to know that others too have the time to converse and are willing to do so, rather than racing off to face another working day. These are all pretty simple things but have made a huge difference in peoples lives, especially those that live alone and long may it continue. I have added some of my drawings that I have been working on during this time, which is my way of using all the extra time to be creative which in turn helps to diffuse the impact of the pandemic. #contemporaryart #oilpastel #oilpastels #oilpastelonpaper #landscapedrawing #drawing #drawings #covid19 #covid_19 #covid  #lockdown #lockdown2020 #lockdownlife #lockdowndiaries #pandemic #pandemic2020 #wellbeing #wellbeingjourney #mindfulness #mindful","NumberOfLikes":88,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Elaine Fox on August 25, 2020.

Rain or shine, I've always enjoyed it. \n\nI used to enjoy sitting on the tube\/bus too though. Using the time to write emails or plans, or just listening to my favourite music. And watching people. \nAnd I used to love to just randomly and casually stop by a caf√® and treat myself with a quick, unplanned break. \n\nI miss doing all this, either alone or with my son and my husband. \n\nAnd although we are making our apartment a nice place and more ideal to spend a lot of time inside compared to the previous house, with a very well looked after communal garden that makes our life with a toddler easier, I miss feeling safe and able to go wherever I want and do whatever I want. \n\nI miss that life so much, much more than I can say. \n\nAnd yes, I'm beyond grateful that the area around our new apartment is very walking-with-a-little-one friendly, and that we can go out for a quick stroll around the block anytime we want since the pavements are spacious and there is a big pedestrian area at our doorstep too where Danny can be free. \n\nBut it is still not the same. \n\nI don't want to complain, but I want to get this constant thought out of the system, because it keeps on coming back several times a day and it's hard to deal with it sometimes. \n\nI'm proud of how I'm trying to cope with the situation ever since last march (we need to tell ourselves we are proud of what we do more often peeps!) but I'm also tired. \n\nIt's time to go back to some regular meditation and Epsom salt baths, just to find the right mindset and to get ready to face what's coming. \n\nLast days of August are always full of reflections and thoughts. And this year, more than ever, these days are also full of hope...\n\n#LaValigiaDiGLo #blog #LaCasadellAlbero #lockdown #pandemic2020 #August2020 #familylife","NumberOfLikes":13,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by GLo Fuson in London, United Kingdom.

READ BELOW\n\nI want to give a few examples from the Trump presidency how this was all SCRIPTED in advance. Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton had a bunch of fake tough talk between each other during the campaigns in 2016, with Trump even claiming he'd put Hillary in jail once he got elected. But after Trump won, he had a luncheon in January 2017, where he honored and applauded, not only Hillary, but also Bill Clinton. PROVING IT'S ALL STAGED AND ALL PHONY! \n\nWe also have Trump's text hotline number which is 88022. I've shown before how Trump is \"88\" in Simple Gematria. I think 8s and 2s were also symbolic of this Pandemic (the new 9\/11) during Trump's Presidency. \n\nTrump made a statement on October 5, 2017 that it was the \"CALM BEFORE THE STORM\". If you add ***888 DAYS*** to October 5, 2017, you get March 11, 2020 which is the date WHO declared this a GLOBAL PANDEMIC. \n\nAnd from 9\/11\/2001 terror attacks up to 3\/11\/2020 there are **222 MONTHS** in between. I think Trump's text hotline was giving us a clue with 88022 (the 8s and the 2s and how they were symbolic). \n\nThen you have the 1990 \"Heavy Metal Magazine Comic Strip\" where Trump and a populist named Helmsley build a WALL in New York City. They eventually have a rift with each other, and Helmsley dismantles Trump. But Trump is poised to make a strong comeback and he hands Mike Tyson a 'hat', and says that they were both hit below the belt by Helmsley but they will be #1 AGAIN (implying a COMEBACK for both of them). \n\nIn November 2020, Mike Tyson has a COMEBACK FIGHT with Roy Jones Jr. It seems there are a ton of clues here that everything during Donald Trump's presidency (even menial things like Mike Tyson fighting again) have been SCRIPTED long in advance.","NumberOfLikes":3,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598371498,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 18:04:58 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"ü§óüòÅ just be\nGrateful for everything\nTry to be better day by day\nI am not perfect but I can be great\nüòéüòò\n#hiworld \n#womaninbusiness \n#womanpreneur \n#holiday \n#pandemic2020 \n#pandemiclife \n#iampru \n#stillgrowing \n#businessfromhome \n#justthewayiam","NumberOfLikes":86,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Marissa-Finance Future Planner on August 25, 2020.

God plants these beautiful desires in our hearts, (unique to each individual) we water them together in hope, prayer & intimacy with Him. Then they grow into bloom in season~ the beauty meant to be shared. It always points back to Him, because it all started with him. We can\u2019t take credit. \n\nThis is the home we\u2019ve been waiting, believing & praying for for nearly 20 years. We felt that without the right timing it wouldn\u2019t have the impact it was meant to, so we waited until we felt a release. \nSpeaking of IMPACT~ December 2019 we stepped out in faith, believing that so much good was coming. It DID. In spite of all that came with Covid~ which included a major loss of income immediately after our down payment. God gave us a gift during a challenging season we never could have anticipated. The joy that came through this process of building was the SWEETEST gift, and it only secures the confidence in my heart that God is kind. Our girls experienced that joy with us & I can\u2019t help but think of all they would have missed out on if the timing was different... even months earlier or later. \nThe reason this carries so much joy for us is because we used to be filled with disappointment for years, and we blamed it unknowingly on God. The past 5 or so years especially we\u2019ve been unlearning some of our negative ideology of God~ that process has been painful, amazing & freeing. Its so easy to associate our past, our pain, our hard experiences with God- yet we needed to learn that God cares so deeply about our past, our pain, and our hard experiences. Before we received this gift, we needed to understand that our blame was misplaced- God has always been a loving Father- it\u2019s our misinterpretation of Him & our lens that has shifted. \nYou\u2019ll have to sit with me here at our house & let me share all the details of God\u2019s goodness with you, b\/c I haven\u2019t even scratched the surface. \nYou are so welcome here ü§ç\n#miraclehome #miracleshappen #beautiful\n#pandemic2020 #homesweethome","NumberOfLikes":91,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":30,"Timestamp":1598363885,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 15:58:05 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"üíÅüèª\u200D‚ôÄÔ∏èüëåüòä‚ù§Ô∏è#pandemic2020  #covid_19","NumberOfLikes":7,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Cinthia Vale on August 25, 2020.

They assumed, like many others, that writing is easy for me, as I used to work for many years as a journalist. It's not at all true. I always thought that you need a good story in order to be able to write something that would be of real interest to anyone. My text is a plain diary of the weeks I've spent in lockdown. My partner found the idea challenging and he wrote a nice short story that is inserted in and adds value to my text ;). He is next to me as I write this introduction and says \"I hope our story is one of the best, there is some romance involved, we should call it Romance in Times of Crises\" - our romance was in crisis indeed, but all's well that ends well. I take pride in saying that our story, by being one of the first, encouraged the others to write; they very likely thought \"I can definitely do better\" and most of them did great! What I like best about these stories is their authenticity, the authors are all genuine and so real, I am honoured to be in such a good company.. \nThe book is about to be published, I am very proud of my friends who made it happen.\"\n#worldspandemicchronicles\n#2020vision\n#lockdown2020\n#uk\n#lockdownlife\n#lockdonuk\n#quarantinelife\n#pandemic2020 #covid_19  #covid19 #scarborough #uk","NumberOfLikes":11,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @worldspandemicchronicles on August 25, 2020.

One of my favorite words is HOPE. I've had to rely on hope and prayer throughout the last number of years. Some call,it a mantra and I call it my 'mindful or intentional words'. Here they are \"hope anchors the soul\" It races to my mind when \"worries voices starts chirping\" to silence him. What words\/phrases calm you down, focus your soul, and give your brain a rest?  Take a bit of time and grab some intentional words, they'll be ready when you need them.  School is not going to be the same when we get back. It's going to be better.
