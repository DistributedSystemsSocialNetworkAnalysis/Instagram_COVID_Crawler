Também estão ali, por meio de um concurso para novos talentos, os artistas Selon, Thiago Nevs, Pixote Mushi, Fe Ikehara e Serifa.\n\nSão 3.689m² de arte, segundo a produção, e a ideia é que o evento entre no calendário cultural da cidade. Planejado para abril num formato diferente, com mais convidados internacionais, o NaLata também se adaptou às condições da pandemia, com uma reformulação para chegar ao resultado atual. \n\nPara o curador, a resposta do público \u2013 e da cidade \u2013 foi especial. \u201CUm momento muito forte foi quando percebemos motoboys passando pelos locais e buzinando, como sinal de apoio\u201D, conta Cardoso. No processo de reformulação, ele diz ter entendido com sua equipe que o melhor a fazer, no momento, seria colocar arte na vida das pessoas. \u201CPensamos que estamos todos em casa\u2026 mas não é assim, há muita gente na rua, trabalhando, vivendo pela pandemia.

We started something called Goat Happy Hour in 2015. GHH is basically getting outdoors in a beautiful farm setting, being surrounded by animals and distracting people from stress, illness or depression. Over the years it has helped give so many people happy distractions from what they were going through. At this crazy time, people need this more than ever.\n\nAt a time when it's probably difficult to see your patients over Zoom, phone calls or even in your office, we thought it would be the perfect time to invite you out to have your sessions with your clients on our farm! You can social distance, you can be out in nature and surrounded by animals and make the session memorable & something that they might even look forward to! We will not be charging for this. It will be a donation only basis and everything would be used to care for the farm and the the animals. Please look up @noregretsfarmsanctuary and if you and your clients would be interested in using our sanctuary for a meeting place please contact us! #goattherapy #goathappyhour #goathappyhouroregon #noregretsfarm #naturetherapy #mentalhealthactivities #mentalhealththerapist #mentalhealthcounseling #bentoncountyoregon #oregon #covid19 #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":84,"Hashtags":["#goattherapy","#goathappyhour","#goathappyhouroregon","#noregretsfarm","#naturetherapy","#mentalhealthactivities","#mentalhealththerapist","#mentalhealthcounseling","#bentoncountyoregon","#oregon","#covid19","#pandemic2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Original Goat Yoga™️ in No Regrets Farm & Sanctuary.

As a physician this is reinforced again for years.\u201D\n⠀\n🗣🗣🗣On GAWWWD (in my thick #NY accent) I felt that 💯%. There\u2019s a energized awakening this year since the #pandemic2020 arrived. As a Black woman and Emergency Medicine Physician (ER Doctor), the constant having to assimilate and ingratiate myself into another group\u2019s culture\/mold plus the way of doing things didn\u2019t work for me. Never did. I couldn\u2019t do it anymore. It\u2019s not for me. I know what it feels like to not be able to stand up for yourself at work or correct someone\u2019s assumption about you, your culture or community for fear losing your job. I know what it feels like to be effective in your role; having the same or more credentials as your peers, but be passed over for promotions.\n⠀\nI know the pressure that comes with trying to be perfect and represent your race, culture or community so well because if YOU make ONE DAMN mistake, the odds of you or another Black\/Brown person given another opportunity are slim.\n⠀\nBlack women globally are not monolithic. We are hugely diverse. We don\u2019t need to fit your mold, shrink our intelligence, power or talent to be deemed as brilliant.\n⠀\nHere\u2019s how diversity and inclusiveness at workplaces, academic institutions etc can improve. We want to NOT only be in the room, NOT only be at the table, BUT also contribute to the decision-making process. Black women overall have a powerful ability to make something out of nothing; turning the impossible to possible. What one may see as useless, we are able to find beauty and purpose.\n⠀\n⠀\n#BlackDoctor #Physician #ERDoctor #healthcareworkers #EmergencyMedicine #BlackHealth #diversityandinclusion #africanamericanwomen #blackwomenmatter #blackwomen #afrolatinas #WomenInMedicine #DoctorsOfInstagram #toxicfreeliving #orangetheory #WomensHealth #covid19 #racismisreal #psych #racisminamerica #corporateamerica #yale #africanwomen #caribbeanwomen #cubana #🇨🇺","NumberOfLikes":226,"Hashtags":["#sundaysermon","#NY","#pandemic2020","#BlackDoctor","#Physician","#ERDoctor","#healthcareworkers","#EmergencyMedicine","#BlackHealth","#diversityandinclusion","#africanamericanwomen","#blackwomenmatter","#blackwomen","#afrolatinas","#WomenInMedicine","#DoctorsOfInstagram","#toxicfreeliving","#orangetheory","#WomensHealth","#covid19","#racismisreal","#psych","#racisminamerica","#corporateamerica","#yale","#africanwomen","#caribbeanwomen","#cubana","#🇨🇺"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Dr. Arabia Mollette, MD in Brooklyn, New York.

Mutasi virus ini memberikan harapan bagi ilmuwan untuk melanjutkan penelitian karena di dalam kultur sel, mutasi Δ382 tersebut memperlihatkan penurunan kemampuan replikasi virus serta penurunan tingkat infeksinya.⠀\n⠀\nMutasi delesi tersebut dilaporkan di Singapura (29 Januari 2020) dan Taiwan (4 Februari 2020) pada sebagian pasien mereka. Dari hasil analisis pribadi, dengan jumlah genom SARS-CoV-2 asal pasien Indonesia yang masih terbatas, mutasi tersebut belum terdeteksi.

So after we completed our masters together in Food and Nutrition we decided to set up our own health platform. Initially we would just work only on appointment basis as we were new and needed the funds to set up our own thing. Within a year and half of hardwork we managed to rent out our own space for clients. However life is no fairytale and soon we had to give up that space. We were now back to our style of working. It was then that my father in law offered me space in our house to set up my own clinic and Sruti got a similar space in her building and work started again. \n\nAnd just as we thought we were heading ahead lockdown began. With the spread of the pandemic things started becoming difficult for us. It became a task for us to adjust the timings of our clients over video calls and the work load piled up as the diets would be sent later over mail. The clients would often complain about filling up comprehensive forms and check their mails over and over again. But soon we came up with a whole pandemic package which was quick easy and very appealing to the clients. We now keep coming up with webinar\u2019s and exciting contests to keep our clients informed and engaged. And the constant positive feedback of our happy clients kept us motivated and we felt that all the hassle was every bit worth.\nWe are making sure it\u2019s a Happyylockdown for us and our clients as well. \n\n@healthyleap94 @srutiagarwal_ @suranasakshi","NumberOfLikes":32,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":6,"Timestamp":1598178871,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 12:34:31 CEST 2020","Location":"Kolkata - The City of Love"},{"CaptionText":"Summer is for fun, they say.

De acordo com o último levantamento, feito na sexta-feira (14), 170 indígenas já foram infectados por Covid-19 e três deles morreram.\nEm Alagoas, há mais de 68 comunidades Quilombolas registradas. A Coordenação Nacional de Articulação das Comunidades Negras Rurais Quilombolas (Conaq) afirma que uma pessoa morreu por Covid-19 na cidade de Batalha, no Sertão.

Then the course goes into technical tight woods. After that, into the campus, then back out towards the road along the parking garages. There is some fair and birdiable holes, and some not so much. There is a lot of up and down and side hill, along with guardian trees, low ceilings, and tunnel shots to provide a great mix and challenging course. Also there is multiple different basket types.

For today\u2019s stop on my pandemic Hollywood tour I thought it would be fun to visit the home that they used as Bette Davis\u2019 home on this successful Ryan Murphy production! \n\nThis critically acclaimed series chronicled the rivalry between legendary Hollywood actresses Joan Crawford and Bette Davis during and after the production of their 1962 psychological horror thriller film \u201CWhat Ever Happened to Baby Jane?\u201D Jessica Lange and Susan Sarandon star as Crawford and Davis, respectively.\n\nBette Davis\u2019 house from \u201CFeud\u201D is located at 2720 Monte Mar Terrace in the posh Cheviot Hills area of Los Angeles. The massive estate, built in 1926, boasts 7 bedrooms, 7 baths, 5,436 square feet of living space. Please note that this is a private residence so if you visit please do not trespass or disturb the people that live there.\n\nDuring her lifetime and ever since, Davis is considered one of Hollywood's finest actresses. Ferociously talented and ambitious, she won two Oscars for Best Actress  (she won for 1935\u2019s \u201CDangerous\u201D and 1938\u2019s \u201CJezebel\u201C) and was nominated a total of ten times. \n\nFun facts - This gorgeous Tudor style house was once owned by actress Agnes Moorhead (Endora from the classic TV show \u201CBewitched\u201D) from 1946 to 1953. The home was also used as the home to Gretchen\u2019s (Kaley Cuoco) family in the 2016 comedy film \u201CThe Wedding Ringer\u201D.  \n\nSusan Sarandon claimed that she never met the real Bette Davis, but that during the 1980s Davis got word to Sarandon through a mutual acquaintance that she was her actress of choice to play her in a bio-pic. Sarandon was interested, but it was never followed-up on and the two women didn't have any correspondence.\n\nDavis received her final Academy Award nomination for her role as demented Baby Jane Hudson in \u201CWhat Ever Happened to Baby Jane?\u201D Due, in part, to Crawford\u2019s scheming efforts! #filminglocation #feudbetteandjoan #bettedavis #susansarandon #hollywoodtour #pandemic2020 #socialdistancing #wearamask #tonymiros","NumberOfLikes":60,"Hashtags":["#filminglocation","#feudbetteandjoan","#bettedavis","#susansarandon","#hollywoodtour","#pandemic2020","#socialdistancing","#wearamask","#tonymiros"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":7,"Timestamp":1598125463,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 21:44:23 CEST 2020","Location":"Cheviot Hills, Los Angeles"},{"CaptionText":"Magic Luxury Occasions Event Facility LLC \n#shopping #popupshopstl #shopismycardio #ladiesnightout💃 #pandemic2020 #atlbraids #upscalevendor #lenoxmall #phippsmansion #gucci #fendi #louisvuitton #prada #nike #reebok #airjordan1 #fashionnovacurve #whoruntheworldgirls #musicfun #bookmyspace #reserved #reservenow\u203C️ #holidayweekend #birthdayweek #anniversarycakes","NumberOfLikes":1,"Hashtags":["#shopping","#popupshopstl","#shopismycardio","#ladiesnightout💃","#pandemic2020","#atlbraids","#upscalevendor","#lenoxmall","#phippsmansion","#gucci","#fendi","#louisvuitton","#prada","#nike","#reebok","#airjordan1","#fashionnovacurve","#whoruntheworldgirls","#musicfun","#bookmyspace","#reserved","#reservenow\u203C️","#holidayweekend","#birthdayweek","#anniversarycakes"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by M💎L💎O in Magic Luxury Occasions.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598125333,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 21:42:13 CEST 2020","Location":"Magic Luxury Occasions"},{"CaptionText":"#positiveaffirmations #affirmations #dailyaffirmations #positivevibes #positivetalk #positivemindset #positivequotes #yourdoinggreat #justbreathe #youareenough #youaremorethanenough #youarenotalone #youareworthy #nevergiveup #nevergiveup💪 #alwayskeepfighting #mentalhealthquotes #mentalhealthmatters #mentalillnessawareness #youareasuperhero #superman #wonderman #thereishope #depressionawareness #ptsdawareness #anxietyawareness #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife #quarantinememes #quarantinelife","NumberOfLikes":2,"Hashtags":["#positiveaffirmations","#affirmations","#dailyaffirmations","#positivevibes","#positivetalk","#positivemindset","#positivequotes","#yourdoinggreat","#justbreathe","#youareenough","#youaremorethanenough","#youarenotalone","#youareworthy","#nevergiveup","#nevergiveup💪","#alwayskeepfighting","#mentalhealthquotes","#mentalhealthmatters","#mentalillnessawareness","#youareasuperhero","#superman","#wonderman","#thereishope","#depressionawareness","#ptsdawareness","#anxietyawareness","#pandemic2020","#pandemiclife","#quarantinememes","#quarantinelife"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598125248,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 21:40:48 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Keep crazy 😜 people around you!!!

Today I\u2019m going to break down some of the information on schooling within K-12 as well as the college university scene (what I am currently living in)\n\nK-12:\n1. Online education for students forces parents to handle child care, education, and their own jobs all at once\n2. Only 1 in 7 parents say their children will be returning to school full time. If given the option, most parents do not feel comfortable sending their children back to school with these conditions.\n3. Teachers are scared for their health and safety, and thousands have resigned throughout the country.\n4. Many teachers recommended postponing the school year and believe that going back to school is happening too soon.\n5. Home schooling is becoming an increasingly more popular option as a result of the pandemic.\n\nCollege:\n1. One of the biggest threats to COVID outbreaks is large social gatherings, and in college this stems from parties, fraternities, and sororities. These groups are causing major outbreaks at schools, causing some colleges to move online for at least 2 weeks to prevent the spread, and for some to move completely virtual, like UNC-Chapel Hill\n2. All college football has been suspended for this season besides the SEC.\n3. Most universities have a variety of class options ranging from in-person to hybrid to fully online.\n4. There\u2019s been a major drop in foreign\/ international students attending colleges in America and many incoming freshmen opted to take a gap year as well. \n\nOverall, I just want to remind y\u2019all to stay safe, be smart, and wear a mask! The only way we can stop the spread of COVID-19 is to be proactive about staying safe, limiting our contact with others, and social distancing. This pandemic will not go on forever, and it\u2019s important to remember that eventually life will return to \u201Cnormal\u201D. Even though it can seem like everything is ruined in the moment\/ there\u2019s nothing to look forward to, it\u2019s important to remind yourself that by doing the right thing and staying safe you are helping yourself, your loved ones, your community, and your world","NumberOfLikes":182,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Elli Feingold in University of Georgia with @closecallstudio, @georgiatech, @uncchapelhill, @nyuniversity, @sec, @universityofga, and @secnetwork.

At the very end, he told the most impactful story.  One I hadn\u2019t heard before.  I saved the clip and have listened to it a few times since.  It is so profound, I decided to share it here.\n\nHere is my re-telling if the story:\n\nA man was in his garden where he noticed a butterfly struggling to emerge from its cocoon.  He watched as it worked a small hole into the cocoon with its legs but that hole was not big enough for its body to fit through.  It struggled for some time and then went completely still, seemingly exhausted.\n🦋\nWanting to help, the old man decided to open the hole in the cocoon up larger.  The butterfly was able to emerge but instead of flying away, it fell to the ground. \n🦋\nWhat the man didn\u2019t know was that the effort required to emerge from a cocoon is nature\u2019s way of strengthening the butterfly\u2019s wings and preparing it to fly. \n🦋\nI love this reminder that sometimes we have to struggle and trudge uphill through hardship in order to reach our destiny.  Often, the extra effort required to overcome obstacles is what prepares us for navigating life\u2019s challenges.\n🦋\nLooking back on the past 6 months after hearing this story, I started to reframe the narrative in my head.  The obstacles of #covid19 and decreased work hours and home school and cancelled plans are the expert\u2019s course in overcoming challenges.  I am looking forward to breaking free from this cocoon and flying high! \n.\n.\n#jasminestarr #jasminestarpodcast #kencolemanshow #lessonofthebutterfly #pandemic2020 #covid19 #coronahomeschool #virtuallearning #virtuallearning2020 #overcomingobstacles #challenge #motivation #inspiration","NumberOfLikes":21,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#jasminestarr","#jasminestarpodcast","#kencolemanshow","#lessonofthebutterfly","#pandemic2020","#covid19","#coronahomeschool","#virtuallearning","#virtuallearning2020","#overcomingobstacles","#challenge","#motivation","#inspiration"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Dr. Anne Sharkey in Leander, Texas.

Jag har gått i området i många år och idag var mina ögon redo att se den. Jag undrar hur mycket mer jag \u201Dinte ser\u201D trots att det finns framför mig varje dag. Påminner mig om att vi människor vaknar andligt och mentalt i olika tider och på olika sätt. Pandemin har varit en tid för reflektion, att stilla mig i vardagens brus och upptäcka livet på ett nytt sätt. Aldrig har vardagens sysslor gett mig större glädje än nu. Vindens sus i lövträden, regnet som faller och jag får vara torr inomhus, mat att tillaga och äta. Att få sova när sinnet och kroppen är trött. Varje dag är en gåva, jag hade bara glömt det. Så tack för livet och vardagen!\n.\nToday I found it, a new pathway through the raspberry bushes, even thou I have walked by for so many years. Due to, or in my case thanks to the pandemic I have been able to be still in mind and body. Start to appreciate my every day life. My eyes were opened spiritually and mentally to this pathway, in a time when I was ready for it.\nToday I am more grateful for every day chores, for the rain that falls and I can stay at home being dry and warm. To the gentle breeze in the trees and being able to fall asleep when mind and body are tired. Every day is a gift, I had forgotten. Thank you for life and every day life!\n.\n#summer2020 #sommar2020 #pandemic2020 #pandemi2020 #life #grateful #tacksam #gåva #livet #2020년 #여름 #lifeisgood2020","NumberOfLikes":10,"Hashtags":["#summer2020","#sommar2020","#pandemic2020","#pandemi2020","#life","#grateful","#tacksam","#gåva","#livet","#2020년","#여름","#lifeisgood2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Ledarskap i Norr on August 22, 2020.

Long story short, they've taken secondhand snorkels and created PAPRs (Powered Air Purifying Respirator) - and they're extremely effective! Those interested in the fine print, read on!\n...................\n\nHi Jo and Christey! So we had some key updates on our ventilator project.\n\nBased on demand, supply shortages and our research we adapted the project in a very unique manner. \n\nWe created PAPRs using snorkelling masks which can double as a full face respirator for frontliners which can easily replace their face mask, face shield with this reusable less wasteful and significantly better solution. Additionally the PAPR also doubles up as a ventilator mask which can be retrofitted to any CPAP or BiPAP machine commonly available to provide clean breathing support without having any chance any of the risks of the ambubag type we initially had. \n\nThe design already has FDA emergency approval and is being used around the world. We adopted it in Bangladesh and customized it based on our own needs here. \n\nWe are here and being able to support frontliners like never before because of all the funding we received for you guys. So now our ventilator project doubles up as PPE project for doctors too! We are just too excited to share this amazing news with you guys. \n\nwww.justpeoples.org\/covid-19\n\n#JPprojectleaders #localheroes #localleaders #bestinthefield #supportingthemostvulnerable #covidresponse\n #justpeoples #soimpressive #bangladesh #dogoodfeelgood  #grassroots #projectleader  #givingback #makeadifference #grassrootssolutions #localchange #globalcooperationforsolutions #backinglocalchange #DonatetoSaveLives  #JPCovid19Response \n#3dprinting #snorkel #upcycled #PAPR\n#covid19 #pandemic2020 #flattenthecurve #savelives  #faceshields #PPE","NumberOfLikes":14,"Hashtags":["#JPprojectleaders","#localheroes","#localleaders","#bestinthefield","#supportingthemostvulnerable","#covidresponse","#justpeoples","#soimpressive","#bangladesh","#dogoodfeelgood","#grassroots","#projectleader","#givingback","#makeadifference","#grassrootssolutions","#localchange","#globalcooperationforsolutions","#backinglocalchange","#DonatetoSaveLives","#JPCovid19Response","#3dprinting","#snorkel","#upcycled","#PAPR","#covid19","#pandemic2020","#flattenthecurve","#savelives","#faceshields","#PPE"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Just Peoples on August 21, 2020.","NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598072454,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 07:00:54 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#pandemic2020 #memelife","NumberOfLikes":2,"Hashtags":["#pandemic2020","#memelife"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Corona Virus Official Memes on August 21, 2020.

It can severely affect the heart, vessels, nerves, kidney, skin and brain. Studies have shown that SAR-CoV-2 can cause severe damage, even in patients with mild symptoms or those in recovery. Often this damage is detected very late or not at all. People recovering from symptoms noted trouble with concentration, confused thoughts, memory loss, loss of consciousness, seizures, loss of smell and taste, psychosis, anxiety, delirium, trouble focusing, etc. Researchers found that one-way COVID attacks the body is by causing inflammation and swelling of the brain. \n\nBecause of significant involvement of lungs (prolonged ventilators, tracheostomy and dyspnea), nerve damage, and nervous system dysfunction (encephalopathy, stroke, seizure, psychiatric changes, etc.) Cognitive, Speech, Language and Swallowing difficulties are observed in individuals positive with COVID-19. A Speech-Language Pathologist (SLP) can help with the mentioned problems.\n\n⭐COMMUNICATION: When on ventilator\/tracheostomy and individual is unble to voice,SLP can provide with alternative methods of communication. Some individuals post stroke\/encephalopathy have slurred speech (Dysarthria) or language difficulty (Aphasia) which requires help with communication and expression.\n\n⭐SWALLOWING: Breathing tube, vocal cord damage, fluids in lungs, in-coordination or weakness of throat and oral muscles can cause significant swallowing difficulties and requires prompt intervention by an SLP.\n\n⭐COGNITION: With cognitive functions (memory, problem solving, reasoning, attention etc) affected, an SLP can step in with strategies and early intervention.\n.\n.\n.\n#covid19 #covid19india #covid #coronavirus #pandemic #pandemic2020 #speechlanguagetherapy #speechtherapy #languagetherapy #swallowtherapy #dysphagiatherapy #slp #slpsofinstagram #speech #language #cognition #swallowing #aphasia #dysarthria #dysphagia #cognitiveimpairment #tracheostomy #ventilator #encephalopathy #memoryloss #lossoftasteandsmell #nervedamage #seizures #mumbai #fixmyspeech","NumberOfLikes":22,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#covid19india","#covid","#coronavirus","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#speechlanguagetherapy","#speechtherapy","#languagetherapy","#swallowtherapy","#dysphagiatherapy","#slp","#slpsofinstagram","#speech","#language","#cognition","#swallowing","#aphasia","#dysarthria","#dysphagia","#cognitiveimpairment","#tracheostomy","#ventilator","#encephalopathy","#memoryloss","#lossoftasteandsmell","#nervedamage","#seizures","#mumbai","#fixmyspeech"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by All About Speech Therapy in Mumbai, Maharashtra.

Empecé a publicar en 2006, aunque varios años antes ya escribía con esa intención. Mi primera publicación fue un poemario, luego vinieron algunas novelas, un libro de relatos, y desde 2012 también trabajo en la literatura para niños y jóvenes. Como tallerista trabajo en un colegio y un liceo, y de forma particular con adultos. Como librero en librería Purpúrea los sábados y un rato los miércoles. \nEl trabajo de escritor siempre es un trabajo particular, ya que uno suele dejarlo para cuando tiene el resto de los trabajos resueltos. Lo que sí se sintió a partir de marzo fue la diferencia en las ventas. Entre los miles de problemas económicos que derivaron de la pandemia está lo que generó en el mundo editorial: dejaron de comprarse libros, dejaron de editarse. Se generó (en el resto de los países continúa) un problema a la hora de mandar manuscritos ya que frente a una crisis nadie sabía qué hacer y eso detuvo la producción: lo que menos seguridad le daba a cualquier editorial era pensar en libros futuros. A esa incertidumbre le sumé el seguro de desempleo en la librería y me adapté a nuevas formas de comunicarme a distancia con los chiquilines del centro educativo y con el grupo de taller de adultos.\n👇 👇 👇 👇 👇 👇 \n#pandemia #pandemic #pandemic2020 #covid_19 #covid_19uruguay #coronavirus #coronavirusuruguay #everydayuruguay #trabajo #trabajadores #fuerzadetrabajo #emergenciasanitaria #polticassociales #quedateencasa #discurso #realidad #fotodocumental #fotoregistro #fotoreportaje #cronicas #cotidianidad","NumberOfLikes":47,"Hashtags":["#pandemia","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#covid_19","#covid_19uruguay","#coronavirus","#coronavirusuruguay","#everydayuruguay","#trabajo","#trabajadores","#fuerzadetrabajo","#emergenciasanitaria","#polticassociales","#quedateencasa","#discurso","#realidad","#fotodocumental","#fotoregistro","#fotoreportaje","#cronicas","#cotidianidad"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by AnA cUeStA on August 21, 2020 tagging @pericoalcasotro.

The masks? Children home from everything? Not enough time in the day? 🤚 Too much time? The politics? The fear? Maybe the lack of TP! \n\nLast night I fed my kids Mr Noodles for dinner so I could work out. \nThat was my coping. I haven\u2019t been consistent because somebody or some animal is usually in need of ALL OF my time. \nI had to make a sacrifice somewhere because I crave working out. It gives me that wonderful release of endorphins. It makes me feel accomplished. It makes me feel strong and healthy and happy. I\u2019ve been ignoring my body\u2019s unhappiness in order to give to others. \n\nMy back has been sore from being unprotected from my weak core muscles, working nights and lifting patients. There is more to me that touches uncomfortably and gets in the way of other things. My body wants to run, wants to move. Wants to feel exerted. \nFarm work and riding and a leisurely bike ride aren\u2019t enough for me, I need that strenuous physical activity. \n\nSo last night instead of cooking a meal from scratch, I let the kids have Mr Noodles. And it\u2019s totally ok. ONCE IN AWHILE. \nEven with that, I didn\u2019t have time to change into workout clothes, put a bra on, warm up or cool down.

In a pandemic, to survive tough businesses you need razor-sharp thinking. A must-read book for CEOs, entrepreneurs and start-up founders on how to deal with uncertainty. Author Ozan Varol @ozanvarol who served the 2003 Mars Exploration Rovers project, talks about how, \"We're hesitant to think big, reluctant to dance with uncertainty and afraid of failure. These are the bugs.\"\nHere are 7 Secrets of How to Think Like a Rocket Scientist:\nRule 1: Make Doubt your Superpower. Every genius hesitates. We should be fueled not by a desire for a quick catharsis but by intrigue. Where certainty ends, progress begins. Einstein tangoed with uncertainty, conducted imaginative thought experiments and asked questions nobody dared.\nRule 2: Embrace the sense of possibilities, push your limits, explore what is possible.\nRule 3: Question your assumptions. Why you do the things you do. Don't do things that everyone does.\nRule 4: Don't be stuck in systems. They solve problems that don't even exist today.\nRule 5: Create Moonshot goals. Our goals are often safe and cushioned because we fear failure. We have been seduced to thinking flying lower is safer than flying higher.\nRule 6: You must be willing to share your unique ideas with the world, don't be repressed by conformity.\nRule 7: Don't Rulebound Yourself. Ozan writes, \"Research shows we become increasingly rulebound as we grow older. Events begin to rhyme. Days begin to repeat. We repeat the same overworn soundbites, stick to the same job, talk to the same people, watch the same shows. It's choose-your-own-adventure book that always has same ending. Our processes are developed in response to yesterday's troubles, if you don't question it  will impede forward movement.\"\n.\nThink Like A Rocket Scientist is published by Penguin Random House\n#books #book #pandemic #2020 #bookstagram #bookstagrammer #booklover #bookaddict #booknerd #bookreview #booksofinstagram #bookworm #bookgram #booklovers #selfhelp #rules #life #work #think #mind #instamood #insta #newnormal #pandemic2020 #instagood","NumberOfLikes":10,"Hashtags":["#1","#books","#book","#pandemic","#2020","#bookstagram","#bookstagrammer","#booklover","#bookaddict","#booknerd","#bookreview","#booksofinstagram","#bookworm","#bookgram","#booklovers","#selfhelp","#rules","#life","#work","#think","#mind","#instamood","#insta","#newnormal","#pandemic2020","#instagood"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Nona Walia on August 20, 2020 tagging @penguinrandomhouse.

That\u2019s what\u2019s in this smoke and haze. The hopes and dreams of all those that have lost everything in the blink of an eye. That\u2019s what hurts my heart. The lightning the other day left me with a feeling of awe. These smoky skies as a result of the fires caused by the lightning leave me with feelings of horror and sadness. The pandemic has devastated a lot of lives; now this unfolding disaster just adds to the despair and hopelessness. So much is beyond anyone\u2019s control.  All you can do is hope the first responders stay safe and property damage is kept to a minimum. \n.\nThe smoke is so thick it looks like fog surrounding Mt Diablo with just the summit peeking above it. Swipe to the next picture. It was taken three days ago on Monday at the exact same spot. It is amazing how different the area looked today.  Let\u2019s all collectively wish for the fog to come back and the fire threat lessens.  Thinking about all of those that are affected. ❤️.
