However I also don\u2019t  like to be accused of lying like that and yelling at that cop felt really good. A day later I am shocked at how ready to die I often am but also extremely proud of myself.

Taking that extra time to style my bangs has given me the opportunity to give myself that extra care that I always felt guilty\/weird for doing. How odd, that such small things can become big things.\n\nre: coping mechanisms...we all have them to a certain degree. Any time we replace an action\/object\/person for a feeling we don\u2019t want to feel is usually a good indicator that the real desire is to just disconnect from the discomfort. We all do it. There\u2019s no shame in it. All you can do is recognize it, remain aware & choose to feel it to heal it instead of bypass it.

It was a minor wreck and I performed the public service of organization\u2014one of my many great talents\u2014and found an interesting volume for my trouble. As if I needed to add to my TBR pile! Now we\u2019ve moved on to pet rocks. And that\u2019s about all the news that\u2019s barely fit to print for now.

(Bless every single one of you - no matter what decision you made. Bless you!).⠀\n⠀\nOh. And on top of all of that you might be an infertile! What a time to be alive!⠀\n⠀\nMaybe your cycle was canceled after months or years of preparation. Maybe you\u2019re starting treatment and your partner can\u2019t be with you for procedures and appointments. Maybe you're starting your medication protocol for a medicated cycle, IUI or IVF and the drugs you're on are stealing your sanity and you can't get together with friends to take your mind off things. Maybe you\u2019re finally pregnant after years of trying and your partner isn\u2019t able to attend ultrasounds. Maybe you\u2019re precious babe is being carried by a surrogate and you can\u2019t be present for appointments. Maybe you've had a loss - a failed cycle, a chemical pregnancy, a miscarriage, a still birth - and you're unable to mourn the way you truly want to mourn. Maybe you've finally brought a baby home and friends and family can't come and visit, giving you the luxury of simply taking a shower or having five minutes to poop - or both!⠀\n⠀\nREMEMBER, YOU'RE LIVING THROUGH A GLOBAL PANDEMIC.

I couldn't just pack my bags and leave without putting thought to it. There was a lot of planning involved just to take this day trip a mere 150km away.\n\nI wanted to make sure that I absolutely don't come in contact with the locals there. Although I haven't shown symptoms of the disease, I could be a carrier and infect those who might not have the same infrastructure to deal with it like I do.\n\nSo here's a small list of ways to ensure you're travelling responsibly during the pandemic.\n\n-  Check your privilege. Remember that to be able to travel means you have a certain privilege that others lack and you must be responsible with it.\n\n- Choose offbeat locations where tourists\/ locals don't frequent often.\n\n- Roadtrips are the way to go. Public transport including trains, buses and flights should be avoided.\n\n- Pack your food. Don't rely on dhabas\/ restaurants for food. Pack easy to carry and eat food like fruits and sandwiches as well as some packaged snacks from your own home.\n\n- Carry as much water as possible to avoid buying from shops. We carried 6 litres of water in 4 bottles for this trip.\n\n- Ensure hygiene. If you absolutely do have to come in contact with locals, wear a mask, sanitize your hands before and after the meeting.\n\nTravel is inevitable and the coronavirus seems to be here to stay. It's important that all of us do our bit in doing everything we can to ensure the safety of those who's homes become tourist places for us.\n\nHappy travel, everybody ✌🏼 .\n\n#GoProLiveIt #GoProIn @goproindia","NumberOfLikes":343,"Hashtags":["#GoProLiveIt","#GoProIn"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Avantika | Travel Blogger 🇮🇳 in Haryana with @cntravellerindia, @travelandleisureindia, @natgeotravellerindia, @lonelyplanetmagazineindia, @globetrottinggirlsindia, @goproindia, @indiangirlstravel, @indiangirlswander, and @girlswhotravelindia.

According to the CDC, face masks are recommended as a simple barrier to help prevent respiratory droplets from traveling into the air and onto other people when the person wearing the mask coughs, sneezes, talks, or raises their voice. This is called source control. This recommendation is based on what we know about the role respiratory droplets play in the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19, paired with emerging evidence from clinical and laboratory studies that shows masks reduce the spray of droplets when worn over the nose and mouth. COVID-19 spreads mainly among people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet), so the use of masks is particularly important in settings where people are close to each other or where social distancing is difficult to maintain. However, many people still have doubts about the actual efficacy of wearing masks in the fight against COVID-19. Most who doubt are individual citizens, some are from the medical field and some are from the viral research field. They have their reasons, of which some of the often-mentioned ones will be discussed here.\n\nSee more : www.icloudhospital.com\n\n#wearamask #wearmaskornot #covid19 #corona #coronovirus #pandemic #pandemic2020 #virus #health #healthcare #cloudhospital","NumberOfLikes":6,"Hashtags":["#wearamask","#wearmaskornot","#covid19","#corona","#coronovirus","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#virus","#health","#healthcare","#cloudhospital"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by CloudHospital on August 19, 2020.

Being vulnerable on the internet is scary, but I have to get this off my chest. I like to keep things light and encouraging on here, but sometimes you just have to get in the trenches and talk it out. Starting a business in the middle of a pandemic is hard. On the business side, trying to figure out how build things from the ground up, make sure I'm adhering to state regulations, learning marketing, branding, social media. It's a lot. On the mental and emotional side there's trying to find locations that don't have a lot of people, knowing that right now people are struggling and not wanting to spend money, trying to make connections with people when creating connections right now is hard. It's exhausting. Add all the in between real life things- Homeschooling my littles, my college courses, responsibilities as a wife and stay at home mom, all the unrest in the world right now, watching my friends and family have to make difficult decisions. It's a lot! Some days I really struggle to keep it all together and thing running smoothly.\n\u2022\n\u2022\n So this is what it looks like. No fancy office with great natural light. No Pinterest worthy spaces. Just hiding in my room trying to get some work done. Leggings, no makeup, a messy bun because I'm 30 and still can't figure out how to do my hair.\n\u2022\n\u2022\nI don't say all of this to sound like I'm complaining. One thing I've learned is that if I feel a certain type of way, chances are someone else does too. Is that you? Are you struggling with 2020 and all that it's brought? I need you to know that you're not alone. You're not crazy, and you're not dumb for feeling like this.

If you watch my stories than you know that I am in a terrible situation when it comes to housing right now. Due to the pandemic we have to move like immediately, we didn\u2019t get approved for the loan to buy the house since the landlord wants to sell, and the rental market is terrible. I had a mini breakdown yesterday. I started thinking about how I ALWAYS do everything by the book and things just don\u2019t work out for me. When you are trying to break cycles of poverty, addiction, homelessness, it\u2019s not as easy as \u201Cwork hard and you will succeed\u201D. I\u2019ve spent my entire life working as hard as I can, getting all straight a\u2019s, working multiple jobs, and still I always fall short because of something from my past. Both of my parents have passed away, so I don\u2019t have anyone to help me co-sign for loans, or lend me a few dollars if I need it, or teach me how to build credit or apply for a mortgage. My mom let her addiction get the best of her and she started me off with terrible credit when I turned 18 by using my SSN to sign up for cards, gas and electric.. the list goes on. I\u2019ve been trying to work off the disadvantages growing up in extreme poverty with addict parents my entire life.. and it\u2019s fucking hard. My life has been full of struggles, unbelievable stories, things you only see in the movies.. and I could have let it ruin me. But I just let it fuel my fire. Some days I just want to throw in the towel, but then I think about what I\u2019ve already been able to survive. You can get through ANYTHING with hope. It\u2019s not as easy as \u201Cworking hard\u201D, and it won\u2019t always be a straight path, but if you never give up on yourself, I promise you it will just make you more and more unbreakable every single time.

It isn\u2019t a house or a building....it\u2019s a simple set of municipal steps called \u201CThe Music Box Steps\u201D - named after the classic 1932 Laurel and Hardy comedy short called \u201CThe Music Box\u201D!\n\nThe steps, which are the focal point of this hilarious film, still exist in the Silver Lake district of Los Angeles, near the Laurel and Hardy Park!! The steps are a public staircase that connects Vendome Street (at the base of the hill) with Descanso Drive (at the top of the hill), and are located at \u202A923-925 North Vendome Street\u202C near the intersection of Del Monte Drive. A plaque commemorating the film was set into one of the lower steps! \n\nIf you\u2019ve never seen this laugh-out-loud film it\u2019s arguably the famous comedy duo\u2019s most iconic work! The slapstick short\u2019s most memorable scene is a string of gags involving the duo attempting to move a massive piano up a long flight of stairs. In short, they\u2019re absolutely terrible at it. Lol \n\nFYI - Without a piano, these steps aren\u2019t such a tough climb \u2014 it\u2019s comprised of 133 steps with multiple landings.\n\nThis legendary short film comedy won the first Academy Award for Best Live Action Short (Comedy) in 1932. In 1997, the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress!\n\nFun facts - The crate that Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy wrestle with was empty, but the one shown sliding down the staircase really did have an upright piano in it. As it careens down the steps muffled, discordant tones can be heard.\n\nThe idea for the film came to a Hal Roach comedy writer in 1927 when he passed a long flight of stairs in the Silverlake area of L.A. and thought it would be a good idea to have Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy trying to move something heavy up them. \n\nThis was Laurel and Hardy\u2019s only Oscar-winning film together. \u201CThe Music Box\u201D was one of Stan's' personal favorites. Stan kept this Oscar in his apartment in Santa Monica, and he called it \u2018Mr. Clean\u2019. 😂😂😂 #filminglocation #themusicboxsteps #silverlake #laurelandhardy #hollywoodtour #pandemic2020 #socialdistancing #wearamask #tonymiros","NumberOfLikes":45,"Hashtags":["#filminglocation","#themusicboxsteps","#silverlake","#laurelandhardy","#hollywoodtour","#pandemic2020","#socialdistancing","#wearamask","#tonymiros"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1597860285,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 19 20:04:45 CEST 2020","Location":"Laurel And Hardy steps In \"The Music Box\""},{"CaptionText":"I know when that hotline bling\nThat can only mean one thing...\n\n#drake #hotlinebling #pandemicdays #pandemic2020 #jokefromhome #lamejokes #lame #lamecrossfitjoke #","NumberOfLikes":3,"Hashtags":["#drake","#hotlinebling","#pandemicdays","#pandemic2020","#jokefromhome","#lamejokes","#lame","#lamecrossfitjoke"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Shad-Hin Joke Teller on August 19, 2020.

Most people infected will experience a mild to moderate respiratory illness, whilst others will show no symptoms at all. However for some the effects are severe and longer lasting.\n\nOur aim in this yoga programme is to play some role in aiding the process of recovery. By only requiring the use of mostly basic props and furniture, we have tried to make the poses as accessible as possible for everyone.\n\nThe programme was compiled thanks to advice and guidance from Abhijata Iyengar, Lois Steinberg, Gulnaaz Dashti, Stephanie Quirk, the IY(UK) Therapy Committee, IY(UK) teachers who have experienced the virus themselves, and decades of work by BKS Iyengar and Dr Geeta S. Iyengar in medical classes at RIMYI in Pune.\n\nSee the link in our bio to access the video and booklet, which are both freely available.

Most people infected will experience a mild to moderate respiratory illness, whilst others will show no symptoms at all. However for some the effects are severe and longer lasting.\n\nTheir aim in this yoga programme is to play some role in aiding the process of recovery. By only requiring the use of mostly basic props and furniture, they have tried to make the poses as accessible as possible for everyone.\n\nThe programme was compiled thanks to advice and guidance from Abhijata Iyengar, Lois Steinberg, Gulnaaz Dashti, Stephanie Quirk, the IY(UK) Therapy Committee, IY(UK) teachers who have experienced the virus themselves, and decades of work by BKS Iyengar and Dr Geeta S. Iyengar in medical classes at RIMYI in Pune.\n\nSee the link in their bio to access the video and booklet, which are both freely available.

This pandemic encourages us to revisit our #financial needs and help us to reevaluate our #financialplans.\n\n𝐈𝐧𝐜𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐞 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐫𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲 𝐟𝐮𝐧𝐝\n\nHaving an emergency fund equivalent to six months of expenditure may not be enough anymore. A crisis like this can keep people out of the job #market for a very long time and also bring unexpected large medical expenditures. We should be prepared for the worst and make the necessary arrangements to make sure we get to live our normal life.\n\nHaving an emergency fund of at least two years of expenditure could give us adequate protection to fight any future unforeseen circumstances. Individuals should keep emergency funds in low-risk and liquid fixed-income #assets.\n\n𝐑𝐞𝐜𝐚𝐥𝐜𝐮𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐢𝐧𝐬𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐧𝐞𝐞𝐝𝐬\n\nA good health #insurance plan is a must for all. If it\u2019s family insurance then coverage definitely needs to be higher than Rs 5 lakh. Investors should consider having low-cost top-up insurance to increase the coverage amount. Further, adequate term insurance for the main earning member of the family is necessary.\n\n𝐑𝐞𝐯𝐢𝐬𝐢𝐭 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐟𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐠𝐨𝐚𝐥𝐬\n\nTraveling and large social gatherings are two things that are stopped due to this crisis. Many individuals keep vacation as one of their major financial #goals.\n.\n.\nRead the entire article on our Facebook page >>LINK IN BIO<<\n.\n.\n#finance #financial #financialcrisis #pandemic2020 #pandemic #coronavirus #covid19 #coronaviruscrisis #investment #healthfund #funds #insurance #insurancepolicy","NumberOfLikes":4,"Hashtags":["#pandemic,","#crisis","#investment","#financial","#financialplans.","#market","#assets.","#insurance","#goals.","#finance","#financial","#financialcrisis","#pandemic2020","#pandemic","#coronavirus","#covid19","#coronaviruscrisis","#investment","#healthfund","#funds","#insurance","#insurancepolicy"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Genius U on August 19, 2020.

Tapos ako as a friend, wala man lang magawa para sa kanya, di ko sya mapuntahan.💔)\u2063\n\u2063\nI agree dun sa sinabi ni @baninaybautista na kelangan alagaan yung mental health.

Ang mahirap ay yung manatiling mentally healthy while dealing with her condition. Sana wag na sila masyado umiyak kasi the more na umiiyak sila, mas sisipunin sila.

So proud to be part of this important project. \n\nReposting @iyengaryoga_uk:⠀\n\n\"The IY(UK) Therapy Committee has created a video and compiled a booklet with a suggested yoga programme to support recovery from Covid-19. ⠀\n⠀\nAs we know, Covid-19 is a highly infectious disease caused by the coronavirus. Most people infected will experience a mild to moderate respiratory illness, whilst others will show no symptoms at all. However for some the effects are severe and longer lasting.⠀\n⠀\nOur aim in this yoga programme is to play some role in aiding the process of recovery. By only requiring the use of mostly basic props and furniture, we have tried to make the poses as accessible as possible for everyone.⠀\n⠀\nThe programme was compiled thanks to advice and guidance from Abhijata Iyengar, Lois Steinberg, Gulnaaz Dashti, Stephanie Quirk, the IY(UK) Therapy Committee, IY(UK) teachers who have experienced the virus themselves, and decades of work by BKS Iyengar and Dr Geeta S. Iyengar in medical classes at RIMYI in Pune.⠀\n⠀\nSee the link in our bio to access the video and booklet, which are both freely available. Please consider donating a contribution towards this and future Iyengar yoga therapy resources 🙏⠀\n⠀\nThanks to all involved in creating the programme and to @adrienne_karmaspaceyoga for designing the e-book⠀\n⠀\n#iyengaryoga #yogatherapy #covid19 #covid_19 #coronavirus #recovery #covidhelp #yogaforhealing #yoga #pandemic #pandemic2020 #virus #postcovid #yogapractice #loveyoga #yogateachers  #iyengarmethod #yogadaily #practiceyoga #yogisofinstagram #yogajourney\" #iyengarmethod #iyengarprops #iyengaryogateacher #iyengaryogamethod #bksiyengar #bksiyengaryoga #yogatherapist #yogatherapist #therapeutic #recovery #hatha #yogateacher","NumberOfLikes":35,"Hashtags":["#iyengaryoga","#yogatherapy","#covid19","#covid_19","#coronavirus","#recovery","#covidhelp","#yogaforhealing","#yoga","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#virus","#postcovid","#yogapractice","#loveyoga","#yogateachers","#iyengarmethod","#yogadaily","#practiceyoga","#yogisofinstagram","#yogajourney\"","#iyengarmethod","#iyengarprops","#iyengaryogateacher","#iyengaryogamethod","#bksiyengar","#bksiyengaryoga","#yogatherapist","#yogatherapist","#therapeutic","#recovery","#hatha","#yogateacher"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by KarmaspaceYoga Adrienne on August 18, 2020.

I took both of my parents at Dhaka Medical Hospital and admitted them in the Covid isolation unit. \nFrom the beginning of quarantine I was having difficulty with my father, couldn\u2019t make him properly follow the rules. He used to go outside almost everyday, would mingle with mass people, wouldn\u2019t sanitise himself properly after coming back from outside and so on. \nSo during the time of Eid-ul-fitr Abba went to Sonargaon (our village home) stayed there for a couple of days and roamed around the whole village, without any mask or any form of protection. He came back home after 4 days, and the worst happened, which was inevitable. Both of my parents my sister got sick within the span of three days. My father refused to take the RT-PCR test. We often live in a state of denial, which eventually makes us pay a high amount. In this case my father's denials like not wanting to take Covid test, not wanting to get admitted in the hospital when situation seemed to be under control made us pay a lot. \nSo eventually their situation deteriorated and on day 14th of their being sick both of them started having severe breathing difficulty. I only had one oxygen cylinder rented at home. I started giving them oxygen turn by turn but that was not enough at all. As situation already was out of control and I saw that both of my parents might die at any moment, I forced them to get admitted at hospital. \nI never thought I would have to take such responsibility at such a short notice. I lived through my worst nightmare. I wanted to write about this experience but couldn\u2019t make myself doing so. Cause writing about this would make me relive those days again. And even after 2 months of these events I still have nightmares I still find it difficult to fall asleep. \nTo be continued (maybe)\n.\n.\n#inthetimeofcorona #coviddays #covidstories #corona #pandemic #covid19  #coronavirus #pandemiclife #stayathome #staysafe #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife #life #hope","NumberOfLikes":66,"Hashtags":["#inthetimeofcorona","#coviddays","#covidstories","#corona","#pandemic","#covid19","#coronavirus","#pandemiclife","#stayathome","#staysafe","#pandemic2020","#pandemiclife","#life","#hope"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Sumyea Sinha on August 18, 2020.

I've never heard you play.\" My response, \"Very few people have.\" \n\nWhen I was in my teens and early 20s, guitar was my aerial. The thing that I did every day, and tried so hard to meet some arbitrary definition of \"good'\" or at least \"good enough to show people and not feel subpar.\" It is sad to me now, that after 10 years of playing guitar, I never felt good enough to show anyone.\n\nPerfectionism is a soul sucking lie, and I am trying to actively fight against that in aerial, both for myself and for my students. This is the first \"real\" sequence I choreographed for my students after our studio opened for private lessons. This recording of it is far from perfect.

The production team copied the interior of the house, including the spiral staircase, almost exactly on a soundstage at Paramount.\n\nPlease note that this is a private residence so if you visit please do not trespass or disturb the people that live there.\n\nConsidered to be one of the greatest movies of all time, the film stars Fred MacMurray as an insurance salesman, Barbara Stanwyck as a provocative housewife who wishes her husband were dead, and Edward G. Robinson as a claims adjuster whose job is to find phony claims. The term \"double indemnity\" refers to a clause in certain life insurance policies that doubles the payout in rare cases when the death is accidental, such as falling off a train.\n\nPraised by many critics when first released, \u201CDouble Indemnity\u201D was nominated for seven Academy Awards but did not win any. Widely regarded as a classic, it often is cited as having set the standard for film noir.\n\nFun facts - The blonde wig that Barbara Stanwyck is wearing throughout the movie was the idea of Billy Wilder. A month into shooting Wilder suddenly realized how bad it looked, but by then it was too late to re-shoot the earlier scenes. To rationalize this mistake, in later interviews Wilder claimed that the bad-looking wig was intentional.\n\nBilly Wilder and Raymond Chandler did not get along whilst writing the script, a process that was apparently filled with  on-stop arguments. #filminglocation #doubleindemnity #beachwoodcanyon #hollywoodtour #pandemic2020 #socialdistancing #wearamask #tonymiros","NumberOfLikes":73,"Hashtags":["#filminglocation","#doubleindemnity","#beachwoodcanyon","#hollywoodtour","#pandemic2020","#socialdistancing","#wearamask","#tonymiros"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":40,"Timestamp":1597772813,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 18 19:46:53 CEST 2020","Location":"Beachwood Canyon, Los Angeles"},{"CaptionText":"One leg at a time . . . \n.\n.\n.\nIt\u2019s easy to get off track at these times.
