It\u2019s such a weird time isn\u2019t it?!?\n\nI was actually emotional at Ellies volleyball game last week because when they \u201Chuddled\u201D for a time out, they did so \u201Csocially distanced\u201D \n\nIt\u2019s odd thats what struck my emotional cord, but I think it\u2019s because these girls just love volleyball and each other so much and while getting back into it, it\u2019s still just not the same. I am saddened that our children even have to experience a pandemic in their lifetime. I am saddened they are being so rawly exposed to the brokenness of our world. I am not saying I want everything for my children sugar coated nor do I want them to be unaware by what\u2019s happening in our country and in our world but there is a level of protection and peace that we as parents want cover our children in. Every child has been affected by our worlds current state. Maybe not through the loss of a loved one or sickness but all our worlds have been altered. \n\nAnyway, at church Sunday Tim said something that resonated with me. Yes, there is a pretty distinct line in the sand for those that think that masks are silly and stupid and those that believe they help and should be mandatory. I personally am one to err on the side of caution and for us and our family we choose to take the recommended precautions. However, we are not everyone.\n\nBUT, on Sunday Tim thanked everyone for wearing masks to service and said \u201CThis is how we love each other right now\u201D üí° üí° üí° \n\nThis. Is. How. We. Love. Each. Other. Right. Now.\n\nSo with love, I made the sweet Lady Sabers 7th grade  volleyball team masks. üò∑ \n\nWhether you are for masks or against masks we are all still here, in this pandemic together and what we can continue to do even when we things are weird and we don\u2019t have the answers is love each other a little bit harder. #thisishowweloveeachother #craftymom #pandemic #pandemic2020 #lovehard","NumberOfLikes":9,"Hashtags":["#thisishowweloveeachother","#craftymom","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#lovehard"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Elizabeth Casteel on August 18, 2020.

We learned that long ago. What it did help us remember was how to be patient & compassionate with one another, how to sit still, slow down, embrace the quiet, & be comfortable being alone with ourselves. I think these are critical lessons that our kids will value one day. And though I am thankful they want to go back to school, I\u2019m also apprehensive (as I\u2019m sure we all are) & I miss them already. \n.\nWho knows how long they\u2019ll be there.

We have been coping with homeschooling, not seeing family and so many different changes in our lives.\n.\n.\nThis pandemic has taught us to appreciate life, to reposition our goals and just to focus on the minimal things that makes us happy. We have been stressing about this new normal, what it entails, how it will affect our lives mentally, financially and even socially.\n.\n.\nI believe that embracing this change is of importance to our likelihood and sanity.\n.\n.\nI also believe that God is training us to learn to live by faith and prayer.

This is evident within the United States as COVID-19 and structural racism coinfect our communities. In a short period of time, the novel coronavirus has mutated in its pursuits to circulate and infect human life. U.S. racial domination has also mutated, albeit over a much longer span of time, adapting from earlier forms of chattel slavery, Jim Crow segregation and 'colorblind' multiculturalism. In this moment, we witness racism\u2019s altered expressions in the heightened disdain for Black humanity, the systematic detention of immigrant children, revamped expressions of anti-Asian xenophobia and shameless enunciations of white supremacy. While communities continue in their struggle against structural racism \u2014 including a rising Black-led youth movement calling to defund the police \u2014 there is optimism that the development of a coronavirus vaccine can free us from this global pandemic. Yet, even if a vaccine were to be safely manufactured in a timeline unprecedented in human history, it cannot save us from COVID apartheid.\"\u2060\n\u2060\nClick the link in our bio for the full article.\u2060\n(Photo: Mario Tama \/ Getty Images)","NumberOfLikes":117,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Truthout on August 17, 2020.

How are you and your children feeling about going back?\u2060\n.\u2060\nWhen I sent Little Man back to nursery in July I was so worried. Was it safe? Would the changes they'd made freak him out? Would he be happy? How would he adapt after so long at home? Would he get upset going back? Was I being selfish sending him back so I could work? Should I just keep him at home with me? So many questions running through my mind, and so much time spent weighing up the pros and cons. So I understand how it must feel (for both you and your children) now you're preparing to send your children back to school after 5 months at home under such weird circumstances. \u2060\n.\u2060\nThat's why I'm offering 10% off my entire hug range from now until the end of the month, including these squishy hug buttons. Hug Buttons were invented by a mum as a way of comforting her child who was anxious about starting school. She drew a heart on her hand, and a heart on the hand of her son and if he felt lonely or sad whilst at school he could 'press' the button which would then send a hug! These squishy hugs offer a physical form of comfort for children who may be missing a loved one whilst at school, nursery or while their loved one is at work. To take advantage of the offer simply head to my Etsy shop (the link is in my bio). You don't need any codes, the discount is applied automatically. \u2060\n. \u2060\nOh and Little Man absolutely loved being back at nursery. He's completely flourished since he's been back and comes home every day he's there full of everything he's done and who he's played with. I think the transition back was harder for me than him! \u2060\n.\u2060\n#backtoschool #backtoschool2020 #schoolsreopening #endoflockdown #lockdown2020 #socialdistancing #transitionphase #backtonormality #thenewnormal #pandemic2020 #hugbuttons #handmadehugs #backtoschooloffer #handmadecomforts #snugglehugs #hugbuddy #cuddlytoy #pockethug #parentingthroughapandemic #thisisparenthood #shopsmall #shoplocal #summerholidays #schoolprep #etsyuk #etsyseller #etsyshop #discount #salenowon #shopnow\u2060","NumberOfLikes":18,"Hashtags":["#backtoschool","#backtoschool2020","#schoolsreopening","#endoflockdown","#lockdown2020","#socialdistancing","#transitionphase","#backtonormality","#thenewnormal","#pandemic2020","#hugbuttons","#handmadehugs","#backtoschooloffer","#handmadecomforts","#snugglehugs","#hugbuddy","#cuddlytoy","#pockethug","#parentingthroughapandemic","#thisisparenthood","#shopsmall","#shoplocal","#summerholidays","#schoolprep","#etsyuk","#etsyseller","#etsyshop","#discount","#salenowon","#shopnow\u2060"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Handmade Unique Toys in Newcastle upon Tyne.

Thankfully the building, and the \"Alto Nido\" sign out front that is glimpsed briefly in the film, are still there! Yay! \n\nLocated at \u202A1851 North Ivar Street\u202C in Hollywood, the Spanish-Colonial style building, with its red tile roof and wrought-iron balconies, was built in 1930 and was first used as a hotel. Around the late 1940s it was converted into an apartment home and became a residence for aspiring actors, screenwriters, and dreamers hoping to make a name for themselves in tinsel-town. \n\nPlease note that this is a private residence so if you visit please do not trespass or disturb the people that live there.\n\nDirected and co-written by Billy Wilder, \u201CSunset Blvd\u201D also stars Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond, a former silent-film star who draws Joe into her demented fantasy world, where she dreams of making a triumphant return to the screen. Erich von Stroheim plays Max von Mayerling, her devoted butler, and Nancy Olson as the fresh faced ingenue who falls for Joe. \n\nFun facts - According to The Movieland Directory, a few of the recognizable names that took up residence in Alto Nido during the golden age of Hollywood were Roscoe \u201CFatty\u201D Arbuckle, Claudette Colbert, Pat O\u2019Brien, George Cukor, and Al \u201CGrandpa Munster\u201D Lewis. \n\nThis historic apartment building is also supposedly one of the places Elizabeth Short, \u201CThe Black Dahlia\", lived before her brutal murder. Hence, it was used in the 2006 movie, \u201CThe Black Dahlia\u201D\n\n\u201CSunset Boulevard\u201D was nominated for 11 Academy Awards(including nominations in all four acting categories) and won three. It is often ranked among the greatest movies ever made. #filminglocation #altonidoapartments #joegillis #sunsetboulevardmovie #hollywoodtour #pandemic2020 #socialdistancing #wearamask #tonymiros","NumberOfLikes":44,"Hashtags":["#filminglocation","#altonidoapartments","#joegillis","#sunsetboulevardmovie","#hollywoodtour","#pandemic2020","#socialdistancing","#wearamask","#tonymiros"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1597687523,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 20:05:23 CEST 2020","Location":"Alto Nido"},{"Owner":"ellen_wildman","CaptionText":"Man it\u2019s been a üí© storm around here the last month or so.

This year has taken the world by storm, fire and water quite literally. Some things aren\u2019t within our control and that\u2019s really mostly all of 2020.\n.\nHowever, there is so much that we still are capable of and that is where I believe we underestimate ourselves. To be part of the world that struggles and yet revives, to stand up a little stronger, cling on to hope a little tighter and hold on to faith a little deeper. To go all out and donate generously, empathise passionately and help fervently. To believe there is one overlooking all of this despair and absolutely nothing happens without his knowledge. That no matter how bad it gets, you will get through this , for no soul shall be burdened more than he can bear.\n.\nLook at the glorious skies and enwrap yourself with the beauty of this world. Soak yourself in the warmth of the horizon for it does leave you with a sense of gratitude, hope and faith.\nWhile we wake up each day to something that breaks our heart yet again, know that there are also stories of joy and happiness witnessing that very moment. And for every heartbreak, we have a little something we can offer to the world.

We must learn how to listen to our Soul and realize who we really are and what we came for. And then we must find the courage to go for it, with love and respect, as adults, taking care of our own fears and emotions, and the people around us. If we paralyze in the comfort zone, once we know that we have to move out of it, we are occupying somebody else\u2019s place. It is like a big theatre, if we are sitting on a chair that is not for us anymore and is meant to be for somebody else, that person can\u2019t sit there until we stand up. At the beginning we will find a lot of resistance, and we will want to go back, but life always finds a way to break through and wanting it or not we reach a point of no return. Then everything falls into place and we understand that it was not only about us. While we are searching our own path in a conscious way, we are co-creating with the entire universe for the well being of everybody.

There were many positives like double-pained windows, air conditioning in the bedroom, and the fabulous rooftop garden terrace. However it was very small, which was not an issue when I rented it in February and was out most of the time, but became a big issue when CV19 caused a lockdown.  Plus, it was a very new modern apartment and I tend to prefer something older with charm, character and heart.\nüíù\nMy apartment in Patzcuaro is amazing! I am across the street from a Buddhist retreat center. I have a large private courtyard; my puppy and I spend a lot of time out there. There is a second bedroom, a laundry room, and a very sweet atrium\/meditation room off the kitchen. When I got rid of most of my possessions before moving to Mexico, letting go of my art collection was difficult. My current landlord is an art collector so my apartment is full of art and handmade furniture. My upstairs neighbor is very friendly and kind. When I had a root canal the 2nd week I was here, she made me homemade carrot ginger soup. She has taken me to her favorite places and introduced me to her friends. She is in love with my puppy and frequently comes down to the courtyard to play with Zooey. \nüíù\nSpirit found me the perfect place to live \u2014 it checked all my boxes \u2014 nurturing, inspiring, relaxing, great central location, and recharges me.  Even more amazing ........ my apartment, all utilities, drinking water and wifi is less than $250 USD per month!\nü§ó\nI would love to hear about your ideal living space or changes you have made to cope more effectively with living through the pandemic. üåª\n#expatlife #traveltheworld #womenwhotravel #expatlifestyle #wanderlust #solotravel #solotraveler #mexico #patzuaro #inspirational #followyourdreams #followyourbliss #livingthroughlockdown #authentic #authenticliving #nurturing #healthylifestyle #artcollections #midlife #agingredefined #pandemic2020 #artinaging #travels #ideal #quarantinelife #embraceyourlife #copingwithcovid19 #healthyliving","NumberOfLikes":45,"Hashtags":["#expatlife","#traveltheworld","#womenwhotravel","#expatlifestyle","#wanderlust","#solotravel","#solotraveler","#mexico","#patzuaro","#inspirational","#followyourdreams","#followyourbliss","#livingthroughlockdown","#authentic","#authenticliving","#nurturing","#healthylifestyle","#artcollections","#midlife","#agingredefined","#pandemic2020","#artinaging","#travels","#ideal","#quarantinelife","#embraceyourlife","#copingwithcovid19","#healthyliving"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":30,"Timestamp":1597679252,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 17:47:32 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"an.art.insider","CaptionText":"üëâüëâFOLLOW @an.art.insider @an.art.insider @an.art.insider‚òëÔ∏è‚òëÔ∏è\n.\nTag us or use #anartinsider  to get featured.‚òëÔ∏è‚òëÔ∏è\n.\n#artmemes #artmeme #art #meme #artistmemes #artistoninstagram #drawingmeme#helpingmeme #artworkmeme #memestagram #memestudio #studentiincrisi #universitymemes #memeillustration #memesüòÇ #memeworld #likeforlike #likeforlikes #followartist #artpage #artistfeature #pandemic2020 #memepages #freesketch #freeart #lockdown","NumberOfLikes":60,"Hashtags":["#anartinsider","#artmemes","#artmeme","#art","#meme","#artistmemes","#artistoninstagram","#drawingmem","#helpingmeme","#artworkmeme","#memestagram","#memestudio","#studentiincrisi","#universitymemes","#memeillustration","#memesüòÇ","#memeworld","#likeforlike","#likeforlikes","#followartist","#artpage","#artistfeature","#pandemic2020","#memepages","#freesketch","#freeart","#lockdown"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ùòºùôâ.ùòºùôçùôè.ùôÑùôâùôéùôÑùòøùôÄùôç \u2022 ùòºùôçùôè ùôàùôÄùôàùôÄùôé in Art Memes.

Your access to family and family who live in your home country- your home towns!- and in other countries slowly, but surely, is more and more restricted. You feel stuck although you are in your home town, your home province, your home country.\n\nNova Scotia is my home and being in its nature helps very much mentally escape our situation. But it's also one of many places in my heart.\n\nThis does not make it any smaller or less meaningful.\n\nIf anything, this pandemic continuely makes me realize how much we forget Earth as a whole is our home.\n\nOur cities, provinces, countries, are just sail boats floating on this ball of water. Beautiful communities with their own unique qualities to be valued and cared for.\n\nAs I look at this painting inspired by a summer day driving by St Margaret Bay, I am hopeful that we will continue to adjust our sails to navigate the winds as they come.

The authors believe the \"operation\" will be completed in just three days.\n\nMorell and Winnefeld paint a worst case scenario in the article, published by the private, non-profit, professional military association. They assume the operation will unfold quickly, \"beginning on the evening of 18 January,\" prior to the U.S. presidential inauguration.\n\nAt the same time, China will carry out cyber attacks to cripple the country by disabling the national power grid and other important utilities. This will be followed by a swift sea and air blockade, with several Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) submarines joining in the action.\n\nThe authors imagine the blockade will pave the way for the landing of PLA's amphibious forces. Meanwhile, China would send stern warnings not to intervene to the U.S., Japan, South Korea, Australia and other close Taiwan allies.\n\nOn the second day after military action, global stock markets will crash due to the turmoil. World leaders will make statements condemning the attack, but that's all. Washington, bogged down by multiple issues, will be unable to react.\n\nOn the third day after the attack, Morell and Winnefeld believe it is too late for Washington to reverse the damage. Then, Xi would whitewash the invasion by telling the world, the \"Chinese Dream\" has come true and \"welcome the people of Taiwan home.\"","NumberOfLikes":20,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Xi \u201CSadako\u201D Mingze on August 16, 2020 tagging @shejingping, @ccp_wet_dream, @nl.sc, @afterpeak_, and @taiwan.freedom.

We went to a couple bike shops yesterday and as expected not one had what I was looking for, just something to cruise around the neighborhood on.  The first store we went to a woman and her son were waiting for repairs.
