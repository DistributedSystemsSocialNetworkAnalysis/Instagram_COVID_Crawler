Yep( Max) I wasn't sucking up when I said my husband is a fan. \n\nBack story...\nFunny enough I met @tlcplmax on set of Enlisted when he was working as military adviser for the show and I was doing background acting. It's not a glamorous life but you learn a ton. Plus @geoffmstults, @mrchrislowell , and @parker.young  were pretty fun to work with. Anyway! We chatted briefly on set. That was 2014. This year right before lock down met up for coffee to discuss writing, tv, and of course military life. Maybe someday we'll get to have coffee again or work on a project together- I don't know. I do know that he's a pretty cool dude and I look forward to seeing what else he's got planned. If you're into Graphic Novels you should check his work out. \n@terminallance #battleborn #graphicnovels #militarylife #marinecorps #artists #tvshows #creatives #interestingstories #peopleyoumeet #inspirationsfromlife #lifeexperiences #writewhatyouknow #newworktimesbestselling #coffeecoffeecoffee #backstory #militaryspouse #hollywooddays #lifeisweirdsometimes #pandemic2020 #remembergoingout #prepandemiclife","NumberOfLikes":16,"Hashtags":["#battleborn","#graphicnovels","#militarylife","#marinecorps","#artists","#tvshows","#creatives","#interestingstories","#peopleyoumeet","#inspirationsfromlife","#lifeexperiences","#writewhatyouknow","#newworktimesbestselling","#coffeecoffeecoffee","#backstory","#militaryspouse","#hollywooddays","#lifeisweirdsometimes","#pandemic2020","#remembergoingout","#prepandemiclife"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Kristina Burke on August 15, 2020.

The pandemic has certainly changed things, it\u2019s not what it used to be and the show I worked last night wasn\u2019t even the usual company I work for! \n\nIt\u2019s been a couple years since I worked for @cwe.canada and it\u2019s an environment I truly missed. Every locker room has similarities and every one of them has differences. The difference I enjoy with CWE is actually change, the roster always can change and you can work with a multitude of peers that you haven\u2019t before from other provinces and promotions. A few of my favourite moments were filming promos with people I\u2019ve known for years but never worked with like @lumberjack_larrywoods and @the_cheetahbear . \n\nBeing a travelling roadshow of a promotion CWE isn\u2019t without a heathy dose of new experiences and learning opportunities as well, like trying to amass a float for the door at 6pm on a Friday night when banks are closed because a truck broke down and the float would be late to putting together a newly built ring for the first time. But no matter those hurdles or any other the company always persevered and puts on a great show from bell to bell  that engages and entertains the fans.\nI can say without any embellishment that I really missed working with CWE.\n\nCovid 19 has changed the world in so many ways, it could be another 6 months or more before I work another show, but I\u2019m glad I had the opportunity to get out there with my peers and in front of a crowd again. The tight suit also reminded me its time to drop a few lbs.

It feels like we are pre-programmed to give this response, whether that\u2019s because we don\u2019t think, we just do it automatically, or because we don\u2019t want to bother people with our true feelings. Fearing that we may frighten them off.\n\nSo maybe next time someone asks you this question, take a pause before you answer, and consider whether you feel safe enough to answer honestly. When we feel safe enough to be honest and vulnerable with other people, they will often be honest and vulnerable back.\n\nIt can help to build closer relationships with those around us, and leave us feeling less alone. As the old saying goes, a problem shared is a problem halved, and often by naming and talking about our feelings we can feel a lot better.\n\n#therapistsofinstagram #mentalwellbeing #motherrunner #maternalmentalhealth #runningismytherapy #postpartumfitness #psychology #pandemic2020 #lockdownlife #anxiety #mentalhealthawareness #socialmediaisnotreallife #mentalhealthinfluencer #anxietyawareness #itsoknottobeok","NumberOfLikes":102,"Hashtags":["#therapistsofinstagram","#mentalwellbeing","#motherrunner","#maternalmentalhealth","#runningismytherapy","#postpartumfitness","#psychology","#pandemic2020","#lockdownlife","#anxiety","#mentalhealthawareness","#socialmediaisnotreallife","#mentalhealthinfluencer","#anxietyawareness","#itsoknottobeok"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Chloe on August 15, 2020.

Where the order clearly states: \"Any person with a medical condition or disability that prevents wearing a face covering.\"\n\nI would think my Trigiminal Neuralgia qualifys. Where many times even the touch of something on my face can send me into a painful feel of shocks, fire underneath my skin, pins & needles and pain I can't even discribe on each side of my face, for weeks, sometimes even months. So No, running to Dollar General, with a mask, to get some bread is NOT worth WEEKS of excruciating pain, I'm Sorry. This is especially bad when I am in need of a Trigiminal Block, which I am now. But because my pain doctor is so behind due to Covid I will just have to wait. \n\u2022\u2022\n Let's not even talk about my autism.\nI am on the autism spectrum due to my \"Tactical Defensiveness\" I've had that all my life (thanks brain tumor) It is just a long term that means extremely sensitive to touch.\n(No you can not see it!) When people tell me:\n\"You don't look autistic.\" \nWell what does autism look like?.\nNormally I have learned to cope. But I will get set off, it can result in anger, or tears, just depends on the weight of the day. \nSo if I have a bunch of \"Karens\" in the grocery store telling me I'm intentionally spreading the virus it might result in tears & then my level of anxiety gets up to a 12 & I'm no good for days.\n\u2022\u2022\nI do care about others and myself. (& people may get at me for saying this), but I do not care for others enough to put myself in pain. Don't get me wrong I can wear a mask, I mean I have it pictured. But the conditions must all be just right. I have to have gotten enough sleep, I can't be stressed about other things, ect...Let's be honest when does anything ever line up perfectly for anyone? \n& before I hear \"well just stay home\", \"have someone else do it for you\" I do alot of those things, but sometimes we just don't have those options. \n\nDon't say you are excepting & then judge me.

So what did I do ? ... took 45 minutes of my time to break down in its entirety why I told him No. From acknowledging the fact that he is a responsible kid, and in a different environment I would be inclined to say yes. I broke down racial injustice, from buying a bag of skittles to jogging for your health and well being... I fully broke down the aspects of the world we live in today. Not ideal conversation for an 11 year old, but because I am 1 of 3 parents immediately invested in his health and well being, when I talk to him, I address him as a man since based on his melanin he could be charged as one. \n\nI did all of that yesterday, just to get to less than 12 hours later ....

I was sitting at my kitchen table and the sun was shining perfectly through the blinds. I was sad. I was lonely. I was suffering from panic attacks which I had never experienced before. My relationship had just ended and I was struggling and still am. I didn\u2019t have the support from my friends that I wanted (the physical support) due to the pandemic so I was physically alone. I had this huge feeling of emptiness. I wasn\u2019t eating or sleeping well. I knew these feelings would be temporary or at least I hoped they would be. So I decided to pack up and go see family for much needed support. I\u2019m so glad I did because it has helped tremendously. \n\u2022\nThe pandemic in itself has caused a lot of confusion and pain for people. Add on the racial and political climate to make you feel even more confused and sad. I\u2019m still sad. I still struggle daily with what\u2019s going on in my life and the world around me. Every day I feel better. Every day is a little brighter. I recognize my feelings. I recognize the blessings I have. I recognize the exciting bright future I have ahead. \n\u2022\nOpening up even a little bit about my feelings is very hard for me. Therapy has been a huge help for me over the years and recent weeks to get more in tune with my true self. It\u2019s been challenging, frustrating, sad, exciting, and rewarding. It\u2019s a work in progress. WE are a work in progress.

Never in a million years did I think getting a mask üò∑, and checking daily temp would be part of the back to school list. This year has left me scratching my head on many occasions. The school Bailey goes to handled it very well. There was so much excitement on property! The teachers were genuinely excited to see all the kids. They made it a very special time for kids and parents. They helped lighten the load of the \u201Cshock factor\u201D of showing up to school with everyone in masks and all the different precautions in place. I am grateful that they chose to open her school. \n\nI also continue to be amazed watching my friends who are homeschooling their children. Talk about rising to the occasion and making the best of it. I have seen makeshift home classrooms(super cool by the way), activity centers, daily schedules, and most of all I\u2019ve seen parents connecting with other parents. I know these parents are being hard on themselves and going a little crazy, but please know you are doing AMAZING!! I have so much respect and admiration for you. \n\nOn a side note my heart is full seeing just how capable each of us are. It amazes me to see how we can adapt in hopes of making a better future for our children. While we may not agree with everything, for me personally I don\u2019t agree with a lot, but it\u2019s important that we continue to do and be our best for our kids and our future. Even if there are things that seem out of our control, what we choose to do within our own home could be what makes a lasting difference. There are so many of you that I\u2019ve connected with during this crazy time. I am so grateful for the connection and friendships that have come from this. I hope y\u2019all have a great weekend! \n\n#blogger #nashvilleblogger #vlogger #nashvillevlogger #backtoschool #backtoschool2020 #homeschool #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife #riseuptogether #riseabove #future #school #saturdaymood #family #friends #familyofinstagram #2020","NumberOfLikes":310,"Hashtags":["#blogger","#nashvilleblogger","#vlogger","#nashvillevlogger","#backtoschool","#backtoschool2020","#homeschool","#pandemic2020","#pandemiclife","#riseuptogether","#riseabove","#future","#school","#saturdaymood","#family","#friends","#familyofinstagram","#2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":13,"Timestamp":1597501463,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 16:24:23 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Different sizes dispensers available..\n\n1 246 831 1061 or 1 246 546 4707 \n\n#pandemic2020 #covid19 #sanitizer #clean","NumberOfLikes":1,"Hashtags":["#pandemic2020","#covid19","#sanitizer","#clean"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597501440,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 16:24:00 CEST 2020","Location":"Christ Church, Barbados"},{"CaptionText":"A message from @ankitadave_1 üòáüáÆüá≥\n.\n.\n.\nFollow @xappie.bollywood \n\n#AnkitaDave #bollywood #actress #happyindependenceday #covid19 #staysafe #stayhygiene #pandemic2020 #hindiactress #bollywoodindustry #hindifilms #actresslife #messagetoall #independence2020 #hindifilmindustry #xappiebollywood","NumberOfLikes":8,"Hashtags":["#AnkitaDave","#bollywood","#actress","#happyindependenceday","#covid19","#staysafe","#stayhygiene","#pandemic2020","#hindiactress","#bollywoodindustry","#hindifilms","#actresslife","#messagetoall","#independence2020","#hindifilmindustry","#xappiebollywood"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Xappie on August 15, 2020 tagging @ankitadave_1.

In the US, only 40% of average people have no symptoms.\u2060\n\u2060\nThe reason is adaptive immunity. When your body is constantly exposed to bacteria, viruses, and other microbes, your immune system gets stronger.\u2060\n\u2060\nIt\u2019s why experienced ER docs don\u2019t get sick as often as new docs, and why frequent flyers don\u2019t get sick when they fly compared to occasional flyers.\u2060\n\u2060\nThe people in these data sets get lots of germs so their immune systems already know how to handle similar coronaviruses.\u2060\n\u2060\nThe reason this matters to you is that all this social distancing and hand sanitizer is depriving your immune system of almost all the environmental microbes that are required to keep you strong.\u2060\n\u2060\nRegularly exposing yourself to low doses of other people\u2019s bacteria is the immune system equivalent of mild exercise every day for your cardiovascular system.\u2060\n\u2060\nWhen things finally \u201Copen up\u201D and we stop submerging ourselves in vats if toxic hand sanitizer, your immune system is going to be *way* out of shape. And you\u2019re going to pick up every cold and flu for a while until you get strong again, with far worse environmental allergies.\u2060\n\u2060\nThe longer we wait, the weaker your immune system gets.\u2060\n\u2060\nWhat can you do?\u2060\n-Get outside where there is soil with microbes in it.\u2060\n-Lose that 20 pounds.\u2060\n-Ditch the inflammatory seed oils, especially corn, canola, and soy.\u2060\n-Sleep like a pro\u2060\n-Dramatically cut sugar\u2060\n-Exercise but don\u2019t go hard every day so you can recover\u2060\n-Go grass-fed, or even the Bulletproof Diet which is designed to reduce inflammation","NumberOfLikes":11,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Sarpy Chiropractic in Omaha, Nebraska.

Previously I read an anthology of poetry and loved it. This is an anthology of letters and I knew I had to make it mine as soon as I lay eyes on it. It's beautiful to say the least.\n\n#bookreviewüëá\n\n\"You never came to stay; you never left to return. I never loved to un-love you, and that is the tragedy of my ordinary life.\"\n\n'With Love' is a collection of letters, each very deep and special in its own way. There's a longing for lost love and friendship. There are letters that talk of estranged relationships, and others which speak of people who you felt the closest to not having enough time for you. And then, there are letters which are ambiguous and reading through them you can't figure out who's written them to whom unless you reach the very end. These letters make you raise some very important questions, questions which you try answering but can't. \n\nThere were letters which made me smile, others which made me cry, a few which reminded me of people who have been a part of my life in the past and others that I have loved. There were a few that made me keep the book down and made me sympathise with people who have lived through tragedies. There are letters that talk about ends and others about beginnings. Some about heartbreaks, others about hope. Some about love and others about fear. \n\nA letter made me raise a very important question which was- How do you decide it's time to leave a friendship, a relationship, even a marriage?\nThere was one letter in particular which made me realise how we often contemplate things and don't do them and regret it later. And one made me think how we feel stupid for our actions when in reality all they are is cute. \n\nAll in all this anthology of letters was full of realisations for me. It evoked feelings that I didn't know existed within me. It brought about a flurry of emotions and I was forced to sit back and reflect and give myself closure on things that lie there hanging. It was a book which proved helpful to me in a way no one ever has.\n\nRead it to feel things. Read it to reminisce a beautiful past and be assured that a great future lies ahead.","NumberOfLikes":343,"Hashtags":["#qotd-","#bookreviewüëá"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by JAPNEET\u2022BOOKSTAGRAM\u2022IN üáÆüá≥ in Delhi, India with @booknerdparadise, @booksparks, @penguinindia, @ttt_official, @penguinbooks, @flatlay_gallery, @flatlay, @theb00kstagram, @flatlayindia, @ig.reads, @igreadsindia, @mybookfeatures, @midlandbooksofficial, @bookishladiesclub, @flatlaysquad, @bookishfeatures_, @perksofbookstagram, @bookreviewfeatures, and @flatlayphotographers.","NumberOfComments":57,"Timestamp":1597491616,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 13:40:16 CEST 2020","Location":"Delhi, India"},{"CaptionText":"Help, I got \"Pussy Monster\" by Lil Wayne stuck in my head and it won't go away ü•¥ #ButFirstASelfie #SelfiesForSelfLove #SelfieNation #SelfieGram #PhotoOfTheDay #Quarantine #Pandemic #Pandemic2020 #Coronavirus #Covid #Covid19 #Kawaii #KawaiiGirl #KawaiiGoth #BubbleGoth #PastelGoth #PastelGrunge #AltGirl #AltGirls #AlternativeGirl #AlternativeGirls #Thicc #ThickChick #NewHair #DyedHair","NumberOfLikes":18,"Hashtags":["#ButFirstASelfie","#SelfiesForSelfLove","#SelfieNation","#SelfieGram","#PhotoOfTheDay","#Quarantine","#Pandemic","#Pandemic2020","#Coronavirus","#Covid","#Covid19","#Kawaii","#KawaiiGirl","#KawaiiGoth","#BubbleGoth","#PastelGoth","#PastelGrunge","#AltGirl","#AltGirls","#AlternativeGirl","#AlternativeGirls","#Thicc","#ThickChick","#NewHair","#DyedHair"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by üç≠ü¶Ñ UnicornPlushy ü¶Ñüç≠ on August 15, 2020.

Our death count is now at 21. Cases, albeit slower than before, are still surfacing.\u2063\n\u2063\nAs per my last update, I\u2019m leaning into the narratives and stories that occupy my headspace.\u2063\n\u2063\nSome days there is insurmountable self-doubt, insecurities, anxiety, fear of not helping, not making a difference, not being heard, being a failure, imposter syndrome, and extreme sadness at the world we live in and the injustices all around us. \u2063\n\u2063\nSome of these insecurities stem from social and cultural conditioning of what is deemed 'successful\u2019 at my age. No house, no kids, no fancy car, no esteemed career, etc. After reflecting, I\u2019ve realised that I have consciously traded in crippling debt and security for freedom.\u2063\n\u2063\nOther days I\u2019m overcome with gratitude and love for my life, my friends, my family, the journey I\u2019m on, and the self-awareness that comes with deep healing from previous relationships, and childhood trauma.\u2063\n\u2063\nOften, I find myself wanting to rush the journey. To be 'healed' and \u2018fixed\u2019 and get to all the juicy stuff on the other side. Then I pause, and remember, there is no other side. This is a committed practice of mindfulness, awareness, self-love, empathy, and compassion. \u2063ü•∞\n\u2063\nYou can\u2019t find happiness outside of yourself. And, you have to go through shit to find the answers. These answers raise more questions, and the cycle begins again.\u2063 üíì\n\u2063\nIt took a lot of courage to share this today, my finger has been hovering over the post button for a weirdly long time.

They've been hard, fun, maddening, relaxing, frustrating and dreamy. I think God knew exactly what He was doing. If there is one major silver lining to all of this - for me - it's that I feel like I've become a better mother. I am one billion times more patient now than I was six months ago. I laugh more, I participate more. So, in a way, I'm thankful for this pandemic. \u2063\n\u2063\nLife isn't the same now, and I'm glad. I feel like we're getting back to the way it should have been all along. Enjoying each other's company, talking to our friends, spending longer at the dinner table. Those are the things that matter. I pray my kids look back on this pandemic as a happy time. Sure, everything is different now. But it's better in a lot of ways (not all ways).

Those suggestions include making coronavirus tests broadly accessible, and free. He has said there should be no out-of-pocket cost for patients to receive an eventual vaccine, either. And he has been sharply critical of President Trump\u2019s response to the virus, accusing him of reacting too slowly.\n\nMr. Biden served as vice president in the Obama administration during the passage of the Affordable Care Act, and health care remains a top priority for him. It\u2019s an issue he often discusses in the context of his family\u2019s personal tragedies: He lost his first wife and an infant daughter in a car accident in 1972, and in 2015, his son Beau Biden died of brain cancer. Health care, he said in an early television ad, is \u201Cpersonal\u201D to him. He supports adding a public option to the Affordable Care Act, but opposes \u201CMedicare for all,\u201D the sweeping single-payer measure advocated by some progressives in his party, including Senator Bernie Sanders.\n\nMr. Biden, who served for decades in the Senate, firmly believes in the value of bipartisanship and insists on extending overtures to Republicans even in a moment when many in his own party don\u2019t see negotiating partners on the other side. As a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he also speaks passionately about asserting and defending America\u2019s role as a leader on the global stage.\n\nSource: @nytimes #NYtimes\n#Connecticut #CT #PrimaryElection #August2020 #GeneralElection #November2020 #Democrat #Democrats #DemocraticParty #CTdems #JoeBiden #KamalaHarris #WhiteHouse #Politics #UnitedStates #Election2020 #ElectionDay #Vote #Vote2020 #CTvote2020 #RegisterToVote #VoteByMail #2020 #AbsenteeBallot #BLM #BlackLivesMatter #COVID19 #Coronavirus #Pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":15,"Hashtags":["#NYtimes","#Connecticut","#CT","#PrimaryElection","#August2020","#GeneralElection","#November2020","#Democrat","#Democrats","#DemocraticParty","#CTdems","#JoeBiden","#KamalaHarris","#WhiteHouse","#Politics","#UnitedStates","#Election2020","#ElectionDay","#Vote","#Vote2020","#CTvote2020","#RegisterToVote","#VoteByMail","#2020","#AbsenteeBallot","#BLM","#BlackLivesMatter","#COVID19","#Coronavirus","#Pandemic2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by CT Vote 2020 in East Hartford, Connecticut.

Emotions are energy in flow. It is so important that they flow freely in you and your body. They are great messengers. Emotions are there to be felt and want to be felt and expressed. Our analytical mind cannot do this. \n\nNegative feelings are not bad, because they wake you up. But it is important not to dwell in them for too long, because as soon as we feel negative feelings, we make room for negative thoughts at the same time and this can harm us and others.\n\nTo feel, a strong anger in my stomach or I feel very sad or the fear flows through me, is okay. \nüíß\nIf emotions do not flow freely, this often show up in physical symptoms such as tension headaches, back pain or shallow breathing...Why?

The idea is to NOTICE, to OBSERVE, to CONNECT to yourself. \n\nTHAT is the gift of slowing down. It gives us space to know what\u2019s going inside so we can become more aware. In turn, our increased awareness can help us make choices that align with how we want to feel and live. It\u2019s how we take responsibility for our lives. It\u2019s how we can create a life that feels good inside and out. \n\nSo, although many challenges have risen, which we are still are facing, I hope we, as an entire nation, continue to see the value in slowing down! May we continue to be creative and find ways to do so even after this crisis is over. Like any experience, feel what needs to be felt, release what no longer serves you and bring with you the lessons to move forward mindfully. \n\nHow does that sound?

The table had a number and QR code that when scanned brought us to a list of all the restaurants and how to order from them. Wine was brought to our table by Lauren, the owner of Rebel Rebel and it was so nice to chat with her about business during this time. The atmosphere was fun, but felt totally chill and safe. No rowdiness or people breaking the rules. They had arrows on the ground for us to follow the correct flow of foot traffic. There were beautiful lights, potted plants, wooden partitions, proper signage, ample hand sanitizing stations, and it felt great to be there.

We never know when it would be our last day. And the most disturbing emotion that people feel, after experiencing life at first hand, is \"regret.\"¬†¬†The regret of not saying things when there was time.\n\nThis year was quite a disturbing one. But we can't just say that life was more promising before all of this. \n\nSo, the question that I wonder about is 'why?' Why do people not say things before it is too late? Why people can go the extra mile to prove someone wrong but can never express how much they love each other. And it is not about the people that are close to us. It is about expressing gratitude to all the people that ever had an impact on us. Why can't we just speak about the moments when someone¬†appreciated us or¬†made us feel special.\n\nI thought about starting this account a lot. I backed off many times. I just talked myself out of it, saying that what can I even do with this.\n\nBut this pandemic made me confident about giving my drop of sanity to this vast insane ocean.

Berbeda dengan yogurt, kefir ini merupakan hasil fermentasi kultur gabungan bakteri dan yeast (baik, tidak menyakiti kamu ü§ó) yang bisa bertahan hidup di saluran percenaan meskipun ada di lambung yang sangat asam. Karena bisa bertahan hidup, kultur ini bisa melawan berbagai mikroba jahat di saluran pencernaan. \n\nDitelusuri dari asal muasalnya pun, kefir telah terbukti membuat orang-orang di pegunungan Kaukasus berumur panjang, jarang kenal penyakit. Bahkan ada legenda yang menceritakan bahwa pembuatan minuman ini diperkenalkan oleh Nabi Muhammad kepada kaum ortodoks (religius) sehingga kefir grains (kultur kefir) disebut-sebut sebagai \"Grains of the Prophet\". Pembuatan kefir ini pun awalnya dirahasiakan dengan sangat ketat karena kaum mereka takut akan kehilangan \"kekuatan\" mereka bila kefir grains dan cara membuatnya disebarluaskan. \n\nPercaya atau tidak, kefir sudah terbukti bisa \"membantu\" sel-sel imun tubuhmu melawan covid-19.

Rates of suicide, domestic violence and all forms of abuse have risen astronomically. If you\u2019re blessed to have a job, security and happiness at this time - remember that the majority, are not as fortunate as you. \n\nI count my blessings, I practise gratitude - but I\u2019m prone to triggers. Lockdown makes me feel trapped and isolated, which evokes sadness & anxieties. Outdoor walks are helping me get through the days and I need only reach out - to realise, I am not alone.\n\nWe are truly in this together, I frequently FaceTime my family in the UK, my sis-in-law my girlfriends and my Uni mates, and we\u2019re all over it & feeling the same... There are common emotions & triggers we are all experiencing.\n\nI\u2019ve been so happy to notice alot of people creating music, painting & channeling their inner child whilst all this is going on. I think it\u2019s really beautiful & therapeutic - in a way, we are healing. This is a time of self-reflection and as I say often, healing often means falling first to learn later.\n\nBe kind, to yourself & those around you, try not to do things that harm you. Be accountable, open up to those you trust, splurge on things that are good for you. Before you fire up, attempt to understand where your fear is coming from. Communicate honestly, choose vulnerability instead... you\u2019d be surprised how many people can relate.\n\nRegardless of your view on the situation. Don\u2019t cut yourself off, If you\u2019re feeling depression, anxiety, fear or anger; know that you\u2019re not alone. Reach out to your tribe, it\u2019s more important than ever, that we\u2019re here to support one another. ‚ô•Ô∏è\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#lockdown  #covid19 #saveourchildren  #corona #pandemic2020  #viclockdown  #domesticviolence  #abuse #healing  #therapy  #heal  #pandemic  #covid  #bloggers  #photography  #typography  #wordsmith  #middleeasternmusic  #shortpoetry #thelatestquote  #goodvibes  #lifequotes  #love  #poetrycommunity  #poem  #poet  #poems  #quotes  #writer","NumberOfLikes":41,"Hashtags":["#lockdown","#covid19","#saveourchildren","#corona","#pandemic2020","#viclockdown","#domesticviolence","#abuse","#healing","#therapy","#heal","#pandemic","#covid","#bloggers","#photography","#typography","#wordsmith","#middleeasternmusic","#shortpoetry","#thelatestquote","#goodvibes","#lifequotes","#love","#poetrycommunity","#poem","#poet","#poems","#quotes","#writer"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ·àçÍ™ë\u200BÍ´Ä\u200BÍ´Ä\u200Bùò≥\u200BÍ™ñ üá¶üá∫üá¨üáßüáÆüá™üá¶üá™ in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

I was excited to see the clouds and light return as it\u2019s been a few weeks since we\u2019ve had good clouds and light. Today is day #150 since we\u2019ve started sheltering in place. I\u2019ve been missing a lot of sunsets because every night at 8, our neighborhood puts on a concert. We started on Easter Sunday and have now played 117 concerts with only a few missed days here and there. We started off howling to thank frontline workers and it\u2019s evolved to multi-instrument concerts. There are some days where I\u2019m so busy with work and keeping the kids busy (or from killing each other) that it\u2019s the only time I get to step outside. I play the flute, my son plays the trumpet\/piano, my other son the piano\/ukulele, and my husband occasionally plays the piano as well.  We have neighbors who play the trombone, guitar, ukulele and mandolin.  In those 117 days, we\u2019ve celebrated a graduation, numerous birthdays and even bid farewell to a neighbor who moved after living in the neighborhood for 28 years. Despite being in the neighborhood for 14 years, we\u2019ve gotten to really bond with everyone and get to know them better. As much as I love a good sunset, the tradeoff has definitely been worth it. After 117 days, we\u2019re always looking for new songs to play. If you have any suggestions, please write it in the comments.  How have you all been and what have you been doing during this unique time?  I hope you\u2019re all staying healthy and wearing those masks. ‚ò∫Ô∏èüò∑üíú\n.\n.\n.\n#sunsetlight #paintedsky #colorfulclouds #sunsetbeauty #beautyiseverywhere #theskyabove #silhouettephotography #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife #wearamask #frontlineheroes #frontlineworkers #bayareasunset #eastbay #savoringeverymoment #sunsetvibes #oaklandcalifornia #keepmovingforward #hanginthere #wegotthis #flatteningthecurve #socialdistance #lastdaysofsummer #backtoschool","NumberOfLikes":177,"Hashtags":["#150","#sunsetlight","#paintedsky","#colorfulclouds","#sunsetbeauty","#beautyiseverywhere","#theskyabove","#silhouettephotography","#pandemic2020","#pandemiclife","#wearamask","#frontlineheroes","#frontlineworkers","#bayareasunset","#eastbay","#savoringeverymoment","#sunsetvibes","#oaklandcalifornia","#keepmovingforward","#hanginthere","#wegotthis","#flatteningthecurve","#socialdistance","#lastdaysofsummer","#backtoschool"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":32,"Timestamp":1597386133,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 14 08:22:13 CEST 2020","Location":"Oakland, California"},{"CaptionText":"Covid-19 Tracker  14 Aug, 2020\n.\n.\n.\n#covid #covid19 #covid19updates #corona #coronavirus #coronavirusupdate #coronavirusupdates #pandemic2020 #pandemic #globalpandemic #binod #lockdown #indiainlockdown #Indiafightscorona #Indiafightscoronavirus #indiafightscovid19 #mumbai #maharashtra #mumbaifightscorona #uddhavthackeray #adityathackeray #naredramodi #india #covidcases #coviddeaths #covidrecovery #health","NumberOfLikes":46,"Hashtags":["#covid","#covid19","#covid19updates","#corona","#coronavirus","#coronavirusupdate","#coronavirusupdates","#pandemic2020","#pandemic","#globalpandemic","#binod","#lockdown","#indiainlockdown","#Indiafightscorona","#Indiafightscoronavirus","#indiafightscovid19","#mumbai","#maharashtra","#mumbaifightscorona","#uddhavthackeray","#adityathackeray","#naredramodi","#india","#covidcases","#coviddeaths","#covidrecovery","#health"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597385828,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 14 08:17:08 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"i wanna have some nasty ass car sex üò´ likee ugh i want my üòª beat tf up !!! #explorepage #spamaccount #sexeducation #stevengmusic #relationshipmemes #relateable #relationshipgoals #enjoyitwhileitlasts #explore #postpagesüíï #pandemic2020 #blmmovement #blm #memes","NumberOfLikes":6,"Hashtags":["#explorepage","#spamaccount","#sexeducation","#stevengmusic","#relationshipmemes","#relateable","#relationshipgoals","#enjoyitwhileitlasts","#explore","#postpagesüíï","#pandemic2020","#blmmovement","#blm","#memes"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @yourmoodzfr_ on August 13, 2020.

Pandora's box is open.  Welcome.\n Controlling the system through digital slavery.  Exploitation will be a blessing.  The purchase of significantly cheaper global manufacturing assets will begin soon.\n The Central Bank, Central Banks, the Basel Committee give recommendations to all the Central Banks of the World.  The center of global government is in Basel, Switzerland.\n Those who did not support became Outcasts.\n Syria, Iran, North Korea.\n All current business models are not sustainable and must be revised.  This is an obvious Fact.\n This is how a new world is born.  Globalization has occurred through the World Financial System.  The public still loves dollars, and the Fed is ready to print them in the amount needed to buy all the debt obligations.  It is about buying up the assets of the industrial sector of the world economy.\n The unit of calculation is a significant element of the system.  The pandemic is just a cover.  In the near future, the Eurozone will be torn apart by inequality and imbalances in the deepening economic crisis.  Artificial Deficit of financial liquidity.  Subject to a significant overproduction of the money supply.  The printing press is working properly.

In the financial system, for a long time, decisions are not made by people, therefore, it is impossible to agree with the system.

Everyone\u2019s worlds have been turned upside down. Some are able to handle that better than others. Some are dealing with heightened anxiety, stress, and\/or depression for various reasons and each of these things look different for everyone.\n\nAs someone who has anxiety and mild depression, this pandemic pushed me over the edge due to everything going on in the world combined with other stressful moments in my life that I\u2019d like to keep private out of respect for who those moments involve. I never had extreme physical anxiety symptoms until this year. I truly had no idea what was happening at first. I sought medical care multiple times and each time was told I was fine (thank God!). But the symptoms persisted. I was also losing more sleep than usual and having more mental breakdowns than usual. I noticed myself withdrawing from certain friends\/family and doing the complete opposite to other friends\/family. Basically, it got to the point where I finally decided to see a counselor specialized in anxiety. I put off seeing one for years but after my first meeting, I felt silly as to why I waited so long.\n\nNone of this might seem major to you. Or you may resonate with me. Either way, I hope you understand the importance of making mental health a priority and making YOURSELF a priority. I know it\u2019s easier said than done but don\u2019t be afraid to seek the help you need.\n\nI\u2019m sharing this with you all because I like to be fully transparent.

Truths that may be hard to digest at first, trust it is part of your process to your beautiful unraveling. \n\nI have been experiencing intense shakes, severe coldness and chronic pain. I have had moments of feeling like I am being sucked into black holes, every part of my body aches, Every bone in my body cracks, I have experienced energy physically leaving me as a seperate entity. Intense shifts, timelines crashing before my eyes. I questioned my sanity. \n\nWhat I have realised now is that deep anxiety I was feeling was me protecting myself to what is actually moving through me. \n\nGrief. \nI unconsciously turned off my grieving process. \nI am grieving for so much that has died this year, within me and around me. \nI am grieving for my heart and all the people I have hurt due to my own wounds.
