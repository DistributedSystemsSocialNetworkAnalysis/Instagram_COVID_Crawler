Crecen las dudas sobre esta vacuna por el hecho de que esta aún no pasa por la fase 3 el cual de acuerdo a los estándares internacionales, una vacuna para demostrar su eficacia y que no es peligrosa debe ser probada en miles de personas.\n\n- \"Acelerar los progresos no debe significar poner en compromiso la seguridad\", señaló en rueda de prensa el portavoz de la OMS Tarik Jasarevic. La OMS tambien pone en duda el funcionamiento y la seguridad de la vacuna, pero eso no es todo. Un informe del gobierno ruso advierte que la vacuna anunciada por Putin no es segura. Advierte que la vacuna no debe administrarse a menores de 18 años, mayores de 60, embarazadas, madres en período de lactancia o personas con una variedad de condiciones de salud subyacentes. Añade que no se realizó ninguna investigación sobre cómo podría reaccionar con otros medicamentos y el informe deja en claro que no se conoce cuánto duraría la protección a pesar de las afirmaciones de funcionarios rusos de que proporcionaría inmunidad durante dos años. 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n#rusia\n#vacuna #vacunarusa #putin #covid #coronaviruspandemic #pandemic2020 #pandemia2020 #oms #sputnik #sputnikv #vladimirputin #covidargentina #covidcolombia #coviduruguay #covidchile","NumberOfLikes":174,"Hashtags":["#rusia","#vacuna","#vacunarusa","#putin","#covid","#coronaviruspandemic","#pandemic2020","#pandemia2020","#oms","#sputnik","#sputnikv","#vladimirputin","#covidargentina","#covidcolombia","#coviduruguay","#covidchile"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597337871,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 13 18:57:51 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Positivity Rules part 3 done, 2 more to go soon! #caterpillarcrossstitchsal #positivityrules #lockdown #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":2,"Hashtags":["#caterpillarcrossstitchsal","#positivityrules","#lockdown","#pandemic2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @portiabelle8 on August 13, 2020.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597337853,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 13 18:57:33 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#cardboardart #contemporarypainting #collage #collagepainting #contemporaryart #contemporaryprimitiveart #conteporaryaboriginal #abstractart #artcontemporain #abstractpainting #abstraction #punkart #paintingoftheday #Postadam2001 #painting#diypainting #kunst #newpainting #nuveofeedback #nuveodistortion #transmutatedart #foundobjects #pandemicart #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":18,"Hashtags":["#cardboardart","#contemporarypainting","#collage","#collagepainting","#contemporaryart","#contemporaryprimitiveart","#conteporaryaboriginal","#abstractart","#artcontemporain","#abstractpainting","#abstraction","#punkart","#paintingoftheday","#Postadam2001","#paintin","#diypainting","#kunst","#newpainting","#nuveofeedback","#nuveodistortion","#transmutatedart","#foundobjects","#pandemicart","#pandemic2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by SLB on August 13, 2020.","NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597337740,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 13 18:55:40 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"The tiny humans need us running at full capacity guys!\nBe like Chris Traeger.

Although her page on the university website has been removed, online information such as that in the prestigious Keystone Symposia in which Yan gave a presentation on the influenza vaccine in 1998, indicates she was trained as a MD and Ph.D. In particular, her research interest is focused on infectious diseases or inflammation via different animal models.\n\nYan said that the Chinese government already knew about the coronavirus in late December 2019, but chose to withhold the information, reported Fox News on July 10 in an article titled \u201CChinese virologist accuses Beijing of coronavirus cover-up, flees Hong Kong: \u2018I know how they treat whistleblowers\u2019.\u201D\n\n#who#world #health #organization #coronavirus #pandemic #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife #pandemicorona #武汉肺炎 #世界 #健康 #组织 #病毒 #大流行 #警察 #警察官 #中国共产党 #谎言 #人 #死","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#wh","#world","#health","#organization","#coronavirus","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#pandemiclife","#pandemicorona","#武汉肺炎","#世界","#健康","#组织","#病毒","#大流行","#警察","#警察官","#中国共产党","#谎言","#人","#死"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Happy Mountain in 香港島.

What's more? Acts of kindness have a positive effect not only on the receiver, but the giver, AND others who observe or hear about it! Isn't it amazing?\n\nSo we can be present by taking a moment to be kind to others. It shifts our minds from ruminating on stress from the past or worries of the future.\n\nDuring our current times (#pandemic) many people would appreciate the thoughtfulness. And if you believe that through grace, you've received lovingkindness, it's natural to pay it forward.\n\nActivity: Identify an act of kindness you'd like to do for someone. It could be someone you know or random. And observe the effects. Also make note of how others show you kindness.\n\nWould love to hear in the comments your intents, your experience with kindness, or any inspiring stories you've heard.\n\nShare with a friend to encourage them to be present through lovingkindness.\n\nBlessings💜","NumberOfLikes":13,"Hashtags":["#pandemic)"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Health & Wellness Coaching on August 12, 2020 tagging @kathymansa, @carafernandez, @michelle.afia, @fleesh04, @gloriabrathwaite3, @michelekamiko, @mariaebinu, @winnie_art_photo, @fityourlifeyeg, @ayannagranger, @d_zeebakesandtreats, and @thecounselingconnect.

The vaccine has yet to complete its phase 3 trial, a crucial step that measures a candidate's effectiveness in a large population and can uncover rarer side effects. Phase 3 usually tests a vaccine's safety and efficacy on thousands of people across multiple locations.\nThe Russian Health Ministry said on Tuesday that the vaccine is expected to provide immunity from the coronavirus for up to two years.\nBut researchers don't yet know how long COVID-19 antibodies protect people from reinfection. So it's difficult to say how long an antibody-based vaccine could provide immunity, and it may take a while for scientists figure that out. Researchers are still learning about how long mumps and yellow fever vaccines last, and those have been around for decades.\nA prominent pharmaceutical organization in Russia, the Association of Clinical Trials, urged the Russian Ministry of Health to delay registration of the vaccine in a letter published on its website on Monday.\nThe letter also said developers had failed to follow \"the gold standard\" of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.\n\n#coronavirus #coronaviruspandemic #covidvaccine #covidvaccinelaunched #russia #russiacovid19 #vaccine #clinicaltrials #patients #covidpatients #covid19awareness #covidtreatment #pandemic #pandemic2020 #epidemic #virus2020 #healthcare #helathministry #immunity #disease #viralload","NumberOfLikes":25,"Hashtags":["#coronavirus","#coronaviruspandemic","#covidvaccine","#covidvaccinelaunched","#russia","#russiacovid19","#vaccine","#clinicaltrials","#patients","#covidpatients","#covid19awareness","#covidtreatment","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#epidemic","#virus2020","#healthcare","#helathministry","#immunity","#disease","#viralload"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597246206,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 12 17:30:06 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#8thgrader #pandemic2020 #firstdayofschool","NumberOfLikes":17,"Hashtags":["#8thgrader","#pandemic2020","#firstdayofschool"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Kendra Hansell on August 12, 2020.

We are all in our bunkers, scared and angry.\n\nWhen we emerge, it will be difficult to pause to grieve, given that we all need to get back on our feet.

We have spent so much time trying to stay safe, keeping a distance, that it won\u2019t feel natural, at first, to go toward each other. We will need to strip away our fear of one another if we are going to help each other.\u201D\n\nOriginally published on Advocate.com\n\u2014 Published on August 2, 2020\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#pandemic2020 #covidanxiety #emotionaltrauma #collectivegrief #mourning #mourninginamerica #griefandloss #griefsupport #griefawareness #mentalhealthmatters #mentalwellbeing #emotionalwellbeing #mentalhealth #sadness #sorrow #grief #nami","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#pandemic2020","#covidanxiety","#emotionaltrauma","#collectivegrief","#mourning","#mourninginamerica","#griefandloss","#griefsupport","#griefawareness","#mentalhealthmatters","#mentalwellbeing","#emotionalwellbeing","#mentalhealth","#sadness","#sorrow","#grief","#nami"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Jessica Morgan MD, CIHC, CINHC in Seattle, Washington.

In years past, the last crop of peaches signaled an end to summer. I'm not sure why because August and most of September are brutally hot in Georgia. Yet there is something about peaches that symbolizes summer to me. Perhaps it is my bi-weekly trips to the local farmers market to pick up fresh peaches. Perhaps it is because I cut up a peach and put it in my cereal every morning and eat another for lunch. Perhaps it is the various desserts I make with peaches,  with cobbler being my favorite.  It could even be that the last peaches coincide with children returning to school in Georgia. Every year I look forward to summer for two reasons, the peaches, and summer vacation.

It was done mindfully, with families I know and trust.\n\nHere\u2019s to the mamas who are parenting newborns and toddlers in isolation. Being a new mom is not meant to be experienced alone. \n\nBetween isolation out of necessity during Emory\u2019s first 3 months (navigating tongue tie revision and nursing had me chained to the couch until it was resolved), and then 5 months of sheltering in place, I have literally never seen him interact with more than one baby or kid at a time. His whole life we have been isolated. \n\nIt\u2019s nice to be connected in mom groups on social media, and messenger and text other mom friends. And we have amazing family support that is irreplaceable for navigating this time. \n\nBut there is nothing more heart warming than hanging in the flesh with other health conscious, life-minded mamas and their babes. \n\nToday I surrounded myself with 3 other mamas, so we totaled a room of 4 kiddos. Ages 4 years, 16 months, 14 months and 9 months. \n\nMy living rooms was a whirlwind of toys, snacks, water bottles, diapers, emotions, and play. And I freaking loved it. \n\nWe discovered Emory has no boundaries, he is a great sharer, and he passes out cold after 5 hours of interaction and play with others. \n\nWe also discovered that I can actually find joy in being a mom. Like true joy. And excitement for the future. And visions of community and socialization and fresh perspectives from other new families. \n\nI didn\u2019t get any pics of the fun being had. But this is my sweet babe, snuggling and content, and me feeling just a little stronger tonight. \n\nYou may not be ready to expand your bubble. If it\u2019s not for you, or you think it\u2019s irresponsible, that\u2019s OK. But I make healthy decisions for my family based on what is in my head and heart. And both day today was a great decision.","NumberOfLikes":37,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Multitasking Mom Mentor on August 11, 2020.

I am worried about the students I haven't even met yet. I am worried about their safety and their education. I am worried about my coworkers, worried about both their health and wellbeing. The stress that comes with teaching is already high but teaching during a pandemic is a whole new level. I am worried for my children. I worry about their loss of experiences and skills. I doubt my ability to adapt and provide the very best for my children, my students and my coworkers. These are the thoughts reeling before the sun was even up this morning. Then as I walk to my car I see this in my backyard. I had to pause and take nature's cue to slow down, breathe and recognize the beauty all around me. There are so many things to be grateful for among all of the turmoil.

Only people who have gone through this last year will know what actually happened lol. My shirt is another one of those statements that most can say \u201Ctotally relatable\u201D hahaha. Since we are on the topic I went ahead and linked some really funny shirts and items I\u2019m sure will be relatable for you;) This week is back to school week for us and many others. Whether it be in person or online. I know some have already been back in school for a week or so now. My theory is that when life has you down, make a shirt about it. Wear that shirt instead of letting it wear you. When life throws you lemons make some Damn good lemonade.\nSometimes it will be bitter but if you add some sugar it will make it sweeter.\nThis past year is a prime example of life giving us lemons. Some have chosen to make super bitter lemonade while others have chosen to add sweetener. For us it\u2019s been one of the most challenging years yet. It\u2019s also been one of the best years yet. We have grown in ways I didn\u2019t even know was possible. While I know we all joke about wanting it to stop and asked ourselves \u201Cwhat in the actual hell is going on?\u201D Have you asked yourself what was good about this year? Just for the record in this situation \u201Cgood\u201D doesn\u2019t mean things went great, it means what great things came from the \u201Cbad.\u201D This is a question that goes through my head a lot. While I know it\u2019s challenging to see the light at the end of the tunnel, it\u2019s important to see the glimmers of hope.\nLet\u2019s be real, if we only see darkness and don\u2019t allow ourselves to see the little bit of light, we will never find our way out.

But then, this pandemic happened and the whole world as we know it is not fully prepared for the changes we are experiencing now. It seems that life will never be the same again. \n\nFor some who were greatly affected by the pandemic, life may seem to go downward spiral, one might feel they\u2019re stuck in a rut or immersed in a deep funk. Many plans or goals were changed or postponed. The things that appear to be working and have a chance to succeed before are not the case this time. \n\nI think life wants to teach us a lesson, that we need some kind of wake up call in this deep slumber. Let this period in our life be an opportunity instead to adapt to the situation and endure all the adversities life has in store for us. We need to stop being complacent and demand more from ourselves, that we have our mind and will to work for us, not against us. \n\nIf we desire for a successful career, material things, and other preferred indigents before, now that the table has turned, I think what we need to strive for now is a strength of character and clarity that we can get something and get through all of this.\n\nI saw this from Pinterest and I can't stop myself to replicate a copy of this art and to express the feeling of what's occurring now especially amidst the pandemic.\n\n#upsidedown #pandemic2020 #turnedupsidedown #changesthisyear #artsy #artattack #artoftheday #igart #instaart #arteveryday #beginnerartist #beginnerartwork #artpower #artisticph #artsyguy #artistoninstagram #drawingart #illustration #artwork #handdrawnart #artistsoninstagram #instaart #drawings #visualart #artistph #artoftheday #pencildrawing #pandemicistotallyreal","NumberOfLikes":70,"Hashtags":["#upsidedown","#pandemic2020","#turnedupsidedown","#changesthisyear","#artsy","#artattack","#artoftheday","#igart","#instaart","#arteveryday","#beginnerartist","#beginnerartwork","#artpower","#artisticph","#artsyguy","#artistoninstagram","#drawingart","#illustration","#artwork","#handdrawnart","#artistsoninstagram","#instaart","#drawings","#visualart","#artistph","#artoftheday","#pencildrawing","#pandemicistotallyreal"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Jae Roger on August 11, 2020.

However, I have found peace in being at home since March. I have been writing daily, getting outside every day walking for at least an hour (sometimes more than 1 walk a day), I have been able to give my time from home to causes that are important to me, I have let go and danced with abandon on our sunporch, I have cooked more meals in 5 months than I have in 32 years of marriage, we have had sit down family meals, I have planted and harvested beautiful flowers, I have been able to take care of my family, our clients, and my friends because I have taken the time to stop and have phone conversations about what is going on in their lives. This pandemic has given me a license to slow down and live a purposeful life with peace.
