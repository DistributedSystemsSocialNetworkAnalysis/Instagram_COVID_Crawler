Covid-19 Mengguncang Dunia\n.\nPenulis : Slavoj Zizek\nTebal : 158 Hlm - Bookpaper\nKategori : Sosial Politik\nHarga : Rp. 75.000\n\nSinopsis :\nSlavoj ZÃåizÃåek membedah pandemik Covid-19 dengan begitu mengagumkan. ZÃåizÃåek menggunakan berbagai paradoks untuk mengungkap realita yang seringkali tidak terpikirkan di benak banyak orang. Realita ketidakmampuan kekuasaan dalam menangani pandemik, ditelanjangi oleh ZÃåizÃåek dalam buku ini.\n\nBaginya, kepanikan dalam menghadapi Covid-19 menunjukan bahwa wabah ini tidak dianggap sebagai ancaman serius. Panik! adalah ancaman bagi pasar, karena kepanikan akan membunyikan lonceng kematian bagi imperium bisnis. Kepanikan akan membuat semua orang ketakutan melakukan aktivitas ekonomi, industri berhenti berproduksi karena tidak ada konsumsi, sedangkan para pebisnis berebut untuk menyelamatkan kekayaan karena takut akan dilenyapkan krisis. Sistem pasar benar-benar tidak siap menghadapi pandemik. Sehingga menurut ZÃåizÃåek, masyarakat tanpa kelas adalah satu-satunya jalan untuk mencegah kehancuran dunia karena barbarisme sistem pasar ini.\n\nInfo Buku dan Pemesanan :\n\u2022Whatsapp 08117561677\n\u2022Gratis Ongkir Xtra via Shopee\/bukubodat\n\u2022Discon Khusus via WA\/DM\n\u2022OriginalüíØ\n*\n*\n*\n#bukubodat #pandemic #pandemic2020 #pandemicorona #bukucovid19 #covid19indonesia #slavojzÃåizÃåek #bukuslavojzizek #bukuterjemahan #bukuoriginal @penerbitindependen #covid19indonesia #covid19","NumberOfLikes":10,"Hashtags":["#bukubodat","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#pandemicorona","#bukucovid19","#covid19indonesia","#slavojzÃåizÃåek","#bukuslavojzizek","#bukuterjemahan","#bukuoriginal","#covid19indonesia","#covid19"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Buku Bodat. on August 10, 2020 tagging @penerbitindependen.

It has been very painful at times, as I realized that this business was not only my baby but it was the only place in the world that I truly felt I belonged. Thanks to the sacred pause from covid I was able to hear my Soul\u2019s longing to remember that I belong here whether or not I have this business.\n\u2009\nThis has led me to a deep state of surrender where I allowed myself to totally collapse. For the first time since I started my business 11 years ago I let go completely. I couldn\u2019t make a public announcement for 3 months - unable to come forth clearly while navigating the complex logistics led me to sit in stillness and to access that level of Truth which can only be heard in silence. Being quarantined in Panama granted me a inpouring of messages from my ancestors\/Spirit\/nature in her many forms. Strongest of all, the ocean - who\u2019s ever changing tides carry so much wisdom. \u2009\n\u2009\nSo, while this is not the way I ever thought this would happen I close the doors to this space with deep gratitude. I release control and trust life is leading me to to knowing and loving myself beyond this role I\u2019ve had the privilege to play. I\u2019ll continue to share healing, facilitate community, and create sacred space. The energy we created in this place will continue on in me and in those it touched. \u2009\n\u2009\nI have so much more to share - but for now check out the farewell video that includes my message to the community and words from 11 of the staff from over the years - 1 for every year we were in business, on the @peaceofmindsacredwellness page. \u2009\n\u2009\nAnd yes, I\u2019m gonna come back to say goodbye to you Colorado - in Sept. Come bid me farewell as I leap into the unknown. It took a leap of faith to start this business when I was 22 and it\u2019s taking a leap of faith now to close it.

A comunidade cientifica ainda n√£o confirmou que casos de reinfec√ß√£o possam acontecer nessas situa√ß√£o. Por√©m, ainda devido a falta de conhecimento sobre alguns aspectos da doen√ßa, infectologistas afirmam que √© preciso estar atento para avaliar essa possivel reinfec√ß√£o.\n\nH√° centenas de casos de reinfec√ß√£o confirmados pelas autoridades de sa√∫de da Coreia do Sul, em abril, mas, ap√≥s cuidadosa avalia√ß√£o, conclu√≠ram que esses casos de reinfec√ß√£o seria provavelmente resultado de fragmentos inativos do v√≠rus, ainda presente nos pacientes.\n\nCasos isolados de poss√≠vel reinfec√ß√£o que aparecem no territ√≥rio brasileiro podem ser explicados atrav√©s de diferentes motivos ou causas. Uma delas √© que, ap√≥s a infec√ß√£o sintomatica do COVID, esse paciente n√£o tenha se recuperado totalmente, n√£o apresentando sintomas e, ap√≥s certo tempo, possivelmente devido a imunidade, esses sintomas novamente retorne. \n\nOutra causa √© a assertividade dos testes realizados, podendo ser apresentado tanto falso negativo quanto falso positivo. Nesse caso, poderia ser melhor explicado se o sistema imune do paciente mantem o v√≠rus a n√≠veis que impe√ßam os testes de identifica-lo.

The government does have the right to collect these taxes at a later time (in 2021).\n.\nTrump stated his administration would look to cancel those deferred taxes all together if he wins a second term, though the deferred taxes would help fund Medicare and Social Security.\n.\nüí∞\nA $400 per week enhanced unemployment benefit was authorized, below the $600 benefit that had expired in July after the Senate was unable to move another bill through but above what Senate Republicans were behind.\n.\nThe federal government will cover $300 with states to cover the remaining $100. A total of $44¬†billion from FEMA's¬†Disaster Relief Fund are being reallocated to cover the cost.\n.\nüè°\nAnother Executive Order discourages evictions or foreclosures but does not prohibit them per the language of the order itself. The order asks federal officials to examine criteria in which evictions for failure to pay rent can be avoided, but doesn\u2019t direct landlords to cease evictions.\n.\nSpecifically, the bill asks officials to find means to \u201Cprovide temporary financial assistance to renters and homeowners who, as a result of the financial hardships caused by COVID-19, are struggling to meet their monthly rental or mortgage obligations.\"\n.\nüìö\nSimilar to payroll tax relief, student loans will be deferred through the end of this year. Interest rates on federally financed loans will also be set at 0% through 2020.\n.\n‚¨áÔ∏è\nCongress and the White House continue to work out details of a second wave of stimulus checks and remain \u201Cvery far apart\u201D, per Speaker Pelosi.\n.\n‚úÖSHARE + FOLLOW @thenormalnews for newsüëà\n.\n#news #washingtondc #pandemic #breakingnews #politics #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife #potus #trump #presidenttrump #donaldtrump #share","NumberOfLikes":533,"Hashtags":["#news","#washingtondc","#pandemic","#breakingnews","#politics","#pandemic2020","#pandemiclife","#potus","#trump","#presidenttrump","#donaldtrump","#share"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The Normal on August 09, 2020.

New Zealand marked 100 days without domestic coronavirus transmission but cautioned against complacency as countries like Vietnam and Australia that once had the virus under control are now facing a resurgence of infections.\n\nAccolades are coming from people of various professions, with some hailing this success as a good combination of Science and Political leadership. The Kiwis initially pursued a stringent strategy to eliminate the virus rather than just suppressing it. People have returned to normal life but officials are worried that people are now resisting testing, not using government contact monitoring software, and even violating simple hygiene laws.\nThis milestone has definitely sparked a rare bright spot, not for their countrymen but also for all global citizens to be able to see a COVID free world soon.

Stop wiping your butt with paper, it\u2019s bad for you and the environment. Use a bidet, be healthy, save $ and trees!)\n\nüßª While everyone* was running around frantically stocking up on TP earlier this year, I just sat back (on the toilet) and smirked. I purchased an add-on bidet from @hellotushy over a year ago, and while I\u2019m still getting used to it, and made the switch in hopes of reducing my bathroom waste. The unexpected victory\u2014I was also prepared for a massive panic-provoked TP shortage.\n\nüí¶ Did you know that it takes 37 GALLONS (140 L) of water to produce 1 ROLL OF TP? It takes only 1 pint (or 1\/8 gallon, or < 0.5 L if you\u2019re smart and don\u2019t use stupid US system) to wash your bum with a bidet. That\u2019s a whole lot of water savings.\n\nüß™ About 2-3 oz. of bleach is used per roll to make each one unnecessarily sparkly white. Multiply that by 36.5 billion rolls used by Americans every year, and that\u2019s a sh*t ton of hazardous chemicals. The bleaching processes of paper pulp even though they\u2019ve been improved over the years, still release chlorine gas and dioxins into the air and water. A concern for the health of all animals.\n\nüíâ Speaking of health, repeat after me: BIDETS ARE HEALTHIER AND CLEANER THAN TOILET PAPER. Seriously, when you wipe with paper you\u2019re really just smearing around all the poop and bacteria and not getting rid of it 100%. This bacteria can go on to cause infections, irritation, perpetuating yeast infections and UTIs. I\u2019m not even going to talk about hemorrhoids or anal fissures, because you can look that up for yourself on the Google.\n\nHave any of you switched to using a bidet at home? How else have you reduced your bathroom waste?\n\n*only Americans, because we\u2019re stubborn AF and still poop in pre-19th century fashion.","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ü§¨ for the üåé on August 08, 2020.","NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1596934322,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 09 02:52:02 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#masksformelbourne #mask #masks #fabricmasks #facecovering #covid19 #covid_19 #pandemic #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife #washablefacemask #reusuable #3layermask #cottonmask #masksforsale #masksforsalemelbourne #masksforaustralia","NumberOfLikes":0,"Hashtags":["#masksformelbourne","#mask","#masks","#fabricmasks","#facecovering","#covid19","#covid_19","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#pandemiclife","#washablefacemask","#reusuable","#3layermask","#cottonmask","#masksforsale","#masksforsalemelbourne","#masksforaustralia"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @thecrazymaskgirl on August 08, 2020.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1596933588,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 09 02:39:48 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Cloth face coverings are most likely to reduce the spread of COVID-19 when they are widely used by people in public settings.

This is real people. #covid19 #pandemic2020 #covidsurvivor #wearamask #washyourhands #physicaldistancing #Repost @ayyfeeshow with @get_repost\n„Éª„Éª„Éª\nIt's crazy how much can change in a month. A month ago, in the depths of the night I was taken to the ER for a 3rd time due to Covid symptoms. I don't remember the day before I went or my first day there, everything is very spotty, probably due to the low amount of oxygen I was getting. My heart rate would get high and I would be super winded, coughing sucked. I spent 10 days there, almost half in ICU on high flow oxygen. I was given plasma with antibodies and thank God because that probably saved my life. I was told I would have to prone (lay on my stomach) because if my oxygen level got worse I would have to be intubated. On my first trip to the ER (4 days before) I had healthy lungs and when I was in the hospital I was told they sounded diminished. I was sent home on 2L of oxygen because my body was still weak and wasn't getting enough oxygen when I walked. I lost pretty much all my calf muscle, had bruises for weeks, my memory and concentration got weird.\n\nThankfully I haven't used my oxygen in about a week and that's BIG because boy do we have a lot of stairs. The muscle in my legs is coming back, my heart rate is going down and oxygen is up (except for the delayed drop which is typical of Covid patients). I can walk about a block before things fluctuate, WAY better than a month ago when I would get winded going to the bathroom.\n\nI wouldn't wish this upon anyone. It sucks. I did the things but it still got us. I was pretty quiet about everything because it takes a toll on you mentally as well. It was scary not knowing what was going to happen to me but even though I knew I would've gotten well wishes this was something I didn't want to share, until now. \n\nCOVID IS NO JOKE. \n\nWearing masks is a thing. Please stop complaining about wearing a mask or about the amount of people that can be somewhere. Do those things suck? Hell yeah they do! I had a panic attack one of the first times I wore a mask, it was rough to have one so qu","NumberOfLikes":3,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#pandemic2020","#covidsurvivor","#wearamask","#washyourhands","#physicaldistancing","#Repost"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Xavier Torres on August 08, 2020.

I am a nurse because I know what it feels like to be scared, to be hurt, to feel like you\u2019re alone, to not be enough, to feel like you don\u2019t belong, to not like yourself, & like you\u2019re at the end of your rope. I became a nurse because I never wanted anyone to feel any of these negative things about themself & if I could do something as simple as be kind & make someone feel like they\u2019re not alone then I have done my job.

The same way even we took precautions but how did it entered our body is a question for us too! \n\nIt was a fine morning until I realised that it wasn't fine, I saw my mom lying there, with her body temperature elevated and severe cough. It was that moment I realised that I am doomed.\n\nFirstly, we all were under the impression that it could be normal cold but at the back of the mind we were very very scared.\n\nSince considering it as a viral we started normal treatment but that was something I still regret because her condition was deteriorating like my mark's.\n\nOther day we consulted a doctor who asked us for her X-RAY. \n\nThen seeing the X-ray, doctor said she is positive for the virus  but get her CT for confirmation. I was like anything but corona.\n\nMy dad took her  for CT scan and after seeing the report it was one more step towards the grave. We all were shocked hearing about her reports.\n\nAnd then, we took the decision to shift her to a hospital . She was  in ICU for almost 5 days and when she was tested for corona , yet the results were the same. The day she was admitted, she was kept in covid ward under observation. And she started to feel better and there was recovery and that moment I realised that God does exist. Meanwhile, rest of the family was quarantined  as we were also asked to get our test done.\n[CONTINUED IN CAPTION]\n..\n#coronavirus #corona #coronavirusmemes #coronapatients #coronapatient #covid19 #covid_19 #covid #covƒ±d19 #coviÃád19 #pandemic2020 #pandemic #pandemiclife #pandemicorona #qurantinemood #lockdown #lockdowndiaries #coronav√≠rus #coronagoaway #coronago #2020 #2020isworst #year2020 #coronatime #coronavir√ºs #coronaindia #covid2020 #qurantinecentre #hospitals","NumberOfLikes":142,"Hashtags":["#audiencewrites","#coronavirus","#corona","#coronavirusmemes","#coronapatients","#coronapatient","#covid19","#covid_19","#covid","#covƒ±d19","#coviÃád19","#pandemic2020","#pandemic","#pandemiclife","#pandemicorona","#qurantinemood","#lockdown","#lockdowndiaries","#coronav√≠rus","#coronagoaway","#coronago","#2020","#2020isworst","#year2020","#coronatime","#coronavir√ºs","#coronaindia","#covid2020","#qurantinecentre","#hospitals"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ùïéùï£ùïöùï•ùïñùï£ùï§|‚ÑÇùï£ùïñùïíùï•ùï†ùï£ùï§|ùîºùïüùï•ùïñùï£ùï•ùïíùïöùïüùïñùï£ùï§üìù on August 07, 2020.
