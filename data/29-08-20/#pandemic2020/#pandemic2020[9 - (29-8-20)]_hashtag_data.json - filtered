The photos I\u2019m featuring tonight reflect my creative approach in helping a disappointed bride smile.\n\nThe bride is a young friend of mine who has spent the past year planning a September destination wedding in Maui. Traveling to the Hawaiian Islands had been her life long dream & having a wedding there would have made it a memorable experience. Unfortunately Covid19 has derailed her best laid plans. Facing the reality of the pandemic she & her fianceÃÅe are now getting married by a justice of the peace in a small intimate ceremony. The virtual reception will be through a Zoom meeting.  Senior friends & relatives will be safe from covid19 as they toast the newly weds.\n\nI learned of the cancelled wedding when my friend reached out to me for help in creating a new ceremony. I knew she enjoyed western & eastern spiritual writings & suggested that I meet with her & her fianceÃÅe through a Zoom meeting. For our meeting I changed my Zoom background to my favorite painting of macaws as a nod to the \u201Cworking birds\u201D of Hawaii who often pose with tourists. My friend was touched by my acknowledgment of her Hawaiian dreams. \n\nI enjoyed helping this couple & for a special bridal gift I designed a  necklace influenced by the Hawaiian lei. The luminous Mabe pearl pendant hangs from a chain of large nuggets of citrine, the stone of abundance & joy.\n\nThe bride loves the necklace & will wear it on her wedding day.üë∞üèªüèùüíóüôèüôèüèøüôèüèæüò∑üåéüåèüåç#maui #hawaii #destinationwedding #hawaiianislands #bridaljewelry #bridaljewellery #bridaljewellerydesigns #lei #justiceofthepeace #civilwedding #civilweddings #marriageceremony #covid19 #covidkindness #shelteringinplace #masks #socialdistancing #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife #marriage #marriagevows #chaplain #jewelrydesigner #citrine #citrinejewelry #mabepearl #statementjewelry #necklacesofinstagram #necklaceoftheday #macaws","NumberOfLikes":42,"Hashtags":["#maui","#hawaii","#destinationwedding","#hawaiianislands","#bridaljewelry","#bridaljewellery","#bridaljewellerydesigns","#lei","#justiceofthepeace","#civilwedding","#civilweddings","#marriageceremony","#covid19","#covidkindness","#shelteringinplace","#masks","#socialdistancing","#pandemic2020","#pandemiclife","#marriage","#marriagevows","#chaplain","#jewelrydesigner","#citrine","#citrinejewelry","#mabepearl","#statementjewelry","#necklacesofinstagram","#necklaceoftheday","#macaws"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Bonnie Sluser Lester in Dublin, California.","NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1596854384,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 08 04:39:44 CEST 2020","Location":"Dublin, California"},{"CaptionText":"Just need one more.

My name is Ashlee and I am a firm believer in kindness. It costs $0.00 to be kind to anyone and anything on our planet. We are living in a time where kindness is even more necessary since there is struggle, fear, and uncertainty. So when you go out of your house why not hold the door for someone, give them a smile with your eyes (if wearing a face mask), or give them an actual smile and say hi! We don\u2019t know everyone\u2019s story, but we do know what is happening in our world.. so why not be kind? One day the kindest shop followed me on Instagram and let me tell you I fell in love with their shop for not only their beautiful merchandise but because of their mission. The shop is called @memoriesaremagical and they want to give back the magic and love they have experienced at Disney to families who might never get the chance to experience it. Now the mission is beautiful and the clothes are as well, but I am mentioning this because I am hoping whenever I wear my clothing from them, that someone sees the message #kindnessismagical and smiles. I know that may be cheesy, but hey that is who I am. So if you got through my long soapbox about kindness, why not help me spread it? Whether it\u2019s doing simple acts, purchasing an item from this shop, or whatever you think will bring more kindness in this world.. do it! I feel like if we have more kindness in this world, we will be living in a better world. üåé üíñ","NumberOfLikes":31,"Hashtags":["#kindnessismagical"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Ashlee on August 07, 2020 tagging @instagram, @fujifilm_instax_northamerica, and @memoriesaremagical.

Since daily or weekly walks have become a ritual for many Canadians, it\u2019s also not surprising that nearly two-thirds of respondents visit parks several times a week contributing to a 55% increase in park-use. With this surge in visitorship, many municipalities are further recognizing the numerous health benefits of these spaces. For example, 82% of respondents indicated that visiting city parks helps maintain their mental health. 70% of respondents turn to parks for physical activity while 64% indicated that parks help them connect with nature.\n\nAnother interesting finding from the survey is that 40% of respondents credited parks for facilitating social connection. This is particularly important for people who live in apartments or who have limited access to green space in their residence as urban green spaces can be safe places to interact with friends and family while providing the necessary space to practice physical distancing. Furthermore, access to parks can help ensure the mental wellbeing of people who live alone as they may have limited social contact indoors.\n.\n.\n.\nüì∏ Aleksandr Kichigin","NumberOfLikes":19,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Nat.

Speaking to my infectious disease colleagues who partner with our state\u2019s public health department, air travel is among one of the riskiest situations to put yourself in when it comes to exposure to COVID-19.¬†\u2063\n\u2063\nTraveling and airports are high-stress environments. People are always worried about making their flight, going to the security checks -- there's a lot of distraction. You need to have a certain kind of focus to maintain social distancing, wearing the masks and hand hygiene. But it goes out the window when your attention is scattered, it's noisy and you're trying to figure out where to go. Yes people are well meaning, but the rules tend to go by the wayside.\u2063\n\u2063\nIn airports, you can encounter people from all over the world. These people could be coming from high-risk places and carrying the virus with them.¬†\u2063\n\u2063\nOn the plane, it's almost impossible to stay six feet apart from others, even if no one is sitting near you. During take off, there is no air movement. If you turn on the fan above your head, that's the only air moving. It's a really terrific environment for one person to potentially infect the whole plane. According to Boeing, \u201Ca cabin\u2019s air volume gets refreshed over the course of two to three minutes. There\u2019s debate in the scientific community over how effective aircraft ventilation may be on large virus-containing droplets like a sneeze or a cough.\u201D\u2063\n\u2063\nThere are few known cases of transmission of coronavirus inside an airplane. Contact tracing after a flight March 31 between the U.S. and Taiwan with 12 symptomatic Covid-19 passengers on board revealed no onboard transmission among 328 other passengers and crew, according to IATA. A flight from China to Canada with one symptomatic passenger revealed no onboard transmission. However, preliminary research on a London-to-Vietnam flight on March 2 suggests that one passenger likely infected 14 others, 12 of whom were seated nearby.\u2063\n\u2063\nHow can you reduce your risk?

This pressure to just keep pushing through it all, that we\u2019re all going to make it through this just fine. But I\u2019m not fine. I\u2019m falling apart. This words spilled onto the paper so fast I didn\u2019t even read it till the end, and when I did... I cried. It had been the first breath I took for myself in a while.\"\n\nAbout the artwork, Caitlin shared, \"I created it over a period of two days, with continuous interruptions: \u201CMom, I\u2019m hungry,\u201D (let me switch the laundry, empty the dishwasher, play hide-and-seek,) \u201CMom can I watch this?\u201D (walk the dog), \u201CMom, Mom, MOM\u201D.... The woman in the painting is me. Maybe she\u2019s pausing or holding her breath? But she\u2019s also moving, she\u2019s doing, she\u2019s carrying \u2014 with the weight of the world inside her and crashing over her in waves. She also has strength and resolve while she holds everything up, keeping it from spilling over.\n\nI hope everyone is continuing to breathe and is keeping these waves from spilling over, and when they do, you have someone to commiserate with about it. We are in it together, though it can feel very lonely at times.\n\nIf this poem and artwork spoke to you, leave a comment below for the artists!

Things are still a work in progress! \n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nHowever, I wanted to SHARE 5 things that help keep me on task in this crazy season of life!\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\n‚ú®Prioritize your schedule.\nLook at what is on your plate and decide what is most important and what needs to get accomplished. If you are like me, a to-do list is such a rewarding task! Writing out the tasks that need to be accomplished helps me brain dump and think a bit clearer.\n___________________________________\n‚ú®Assess your resources. ASK FOR HELP.\nYes, I know us mama\u2019s struggle with this. I know I used to. But let us be honest, we cannot do it all. Do you have a family member or sitter who can help for a couple hours? What hours does your husband work? You may need to shift your hours to early morning or evening based on your partner\u2019s work schedule. I am a mix of both!\n____________________________________\n‚ú®Organize your space.\nIf you do have a designated workspace in your home, keeping it organized helps for a more productive work time once you sit down. A decluttered space allows for a decluttered mind.\n____________________________________\n‚ú®Get creative with the places you work.\nHave 30-45 minutes while your kiddo is at camp? Pop out your computer, use your phone hot spot and plug away. Waiting a little bit extra at the doctor\u2019s office? Knock out some of those daily tasks.\n____________________________________\n‚ú®Take Breaks.\nNow, more than ever, breaks are so important. Give yourself some grace and allow for realistic expectations. Personally, we love to venture to the park. Fresh air therapy is good for all of us! No phone, just fresh air, and time together.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nWorking mamas, what are your tips & tricks?","NumberOfLikes":34,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1596812141,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 07 16:55:41 CEST 2020","Location":"Chicago metropolitan area"},{"CaptionText":"#repost from @jo_tampubolon\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nTIRANIüé∂ @lestykejora\n\nCoba lgu dangdut susah bngtü§¶\u200D‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÅ\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n#karimun #batam #bintan #tanjungpinang #lingga #anambas #natuna #kepri #keprimusiccover #musisikepri #kepulauanriauindonesia #indonesia #lesty #tirani #lestykejora #kulepasdenganikhlas #lagudangdut #coversong #videocover #musikgram #musiccover #lfl #lffl #lff #newnormal #indonesianidol #indomusikgram #indomusiccover #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":50,"Hashtags":["#repost","#karimun","#batam","#bintan","#tanjungpinang","#lingga","#anambas","#natuna","#kepri","#keprimusiccover","#musisikepri","#kepulauanriauindonesia","#indonesia","#lesty","#tirani","#lestykejora","#kulepasdenganikhlas","#lagudangdut","#coversong","#videocover","#musikgram","#musiccover","#lfl","#lffl","#lff","#newnormal","#indonesianidol","#indomusikgram","#indomusiccover","#pandemic2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1596812105,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 07 16:55:05 CEST 2020","Location":"Batam Island - Kepri"},{"CaptionText":"No one:\nLiterally no one:\nBritney: let's do this\n.\n.\n#memes #funny #igmemes #funnymemes #igdaily #covidtimes #damn #funnyshit #funnyposts #therapymemes #pandemic2020 #truesayings #relatablememes #relatableposts #covidtimes","NumberOfLikes":15,"Hashtags":["#memes","#funny","#igmemes","#funnymemes","#igdaily","#covidtimes","#damn","#funnyshit","#funnyposts","#therapymemes","#pandemic2020","#truesayings","#relatablememes","#relatableposts","#covidtimes"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by memes and screams on August 07, 2020.

I just had to share this drawing inspired by the photo from Panda\u2019s last post. \n-\nThe artist is 5 year old Lola. She and her sweet family are members of our Lower East Side community garden @childrensmagicalgarden and Lola desperately wants a black kitten so she started her own art fundraiser. Panda\u2019s mom and I were very moved by Rafael and Lisette\u2019s amazing daughter wanting to make this happen. We are happy to say that Lola has just reached her goal and has put in an application for a little black kitty of her dreams! Fingers & paws crossed :) \n-\nPS. Her drawing \u201CPanda with Yarn Balls\u201D is already on display in our \u201CGreat Hall of Small Works\u201D! \n-\nIf you would still like to donate to Lola\u2019s fundraiser (and invest in some fun art) I\u2019m sure that the family could still use some help with vet bills and other related costs.

But for moments, it felt completely normal to be making sure each table looked perfect and watching the bride make her way down the aisle to her groom. These 2020 weddings will be forever stamped into our memory and remain part of our story during these unique times. And for that we are grateful.

Virus ini memiliki tingkat mutasi yang tinggi dan merupakan patogen zoonotik yang dapat menetap pada manusia dan binatang dengan presentasi klinis yang sangat beragam, mulai dari asimptomatik, gejala ringan sampai berat, bahkan sampai kematian.\n\nSampai saat ini, belum terdapat terapi antiviral spesifik dan vaksin dalam penanganan COVID-19. Akan tetapi, beberapa terapi, seperti¬†remdesivir,¬†klorokuin\/hidroksiklorokuin, lopinavir-ritonavir, dan tocilizumab, sudah ditemukan memiliki efikasi dalam penanganan COVID-19 dan sudah masuk dalam uji coba klinis obat. Pasien COVID-19 dengan infeksi ringan umumnya hanya disarankan isolasi di rumah dan menggunakan obat yang dijual bebas untuk meredakan gejala. Pada pasien dengan infeksi berat, disarankan untuk dirawat inap dan terkadang diperlukan tindakan intubasi dan ventilasi mekanik apabila terjadi¬†gagal napas¬†atau¬†acute respiratory distress syndrome.\nJadi, mari saling mengingatkan agar pamdemi ini bisa segera berakhir dan segala aktivitas dapat normal kembali.\n\nWASH YOUR HANDS, STAY AT HOME, AND STAY HEALTHY!\n\n@hmj_matematikafmipa_unm @miswarslh @putrikharinam @ghadythapatasik  @syaribulan_ @agnesssd \nSumber : https:\/\/www.alomedika.com\/penyakit\/penyakit-infeksi\/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19\n\n#dkmm2020 #coronavirus #coronavirusdisease #covid19 #pandemic #pandemic2020 #protokolkesehatan #washyourhands #stayathome #stayhealthy - #regrann","NumberOfLikes":46,"Hashtags":["#dkmm2020","#coronavirus","#coronavirusdisease","#covid19","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#protokolkesehatan","#washyourhands","#stayathome","#stayhealthy","#regrann"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":6,"Timestamp":1596723420,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 06 16:17:00 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"üÜÖüÖ∏üÖ≥üÖ¥üÖæ: üÖΩüÖ¥üÜÜüÜÇ : Bill Gates briefing to Cia  04-13-2005\n\u2022\n#pandemic2020 #coronavirus #covid19 #quarantine #lockdown #socialdistancing #world #news #rants #opinion #connect #art #comic #world #planetearth #animals #humans #earth #billgates #cia #briefing #billgatesisnotadoctor #vaccines #islamphobia #virus #biologicalwarfare #America #usa #thisisAmerica","NumberOfLikes":1,"Hashtags":["#pandemic2020","#coronavirus","#covid19","#quarantine","#lockdown","#socialdistancing","#world","#news","#rants","#opinion","#connect","#art","#comic","#world","#planetearth","#animals","#humans","#earth","#billgates","#cia","#briefing","#billgatesisnotadoctor","#vaccines","#islamphobia","#virus","#biologicalwarfare","#America","#usa","#thisisAmerica"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1596722716,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 06 16:05:16 CEST 2020","Location":"Planet Earth"},{"CaptionText":"2020 in a nutshell... #2020 #quarantinelife #pandemic2020 #ellieshakesitup","NumberOfLikes":16,"Hashtags":["#2020","#quarantinelife","#pandemic2020","#ellieshakesitup"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Ellie Paine | Health & Fitness on August 06, 2020.

Reading the current news gives a major nostalgia of my 12th grade when I studied about cold war in my political science textbook. It all started with china keeping mum on the coronavirus disease in December 2019. They kept supressing it till 31st December 2019, which is when they alerted WHO over the matter. It was too late because people had already left for their home countries to celebrate New Year\u2019s. Migration is at an all-time high around the holidays. This is the fifth month of social isolation for majority parts of the world. The closures and lockdowns have hit economies abruptly. To top it up with a cherry, the Chinese \u2018communist party\u2019 has come down to exploitation of coronavirus pandemic to further its own interests. China is trying to take over the world and establish its hegemony while U.S. is busy dealing with the record breaking cases of the virus. \n\nTo read further- Link in bio. \r\n\n@hupshup \n\n#coronavirus #pandemic #pandemic2020 #tiktok #tiktokban #globalpolitics #instagram #who #news #bloggersofinstagram #writingcommunity #writingsociety #blogpost","NumberOfLikes":8,"Hashtags":["#coronavirus","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#tiktok","#tiktokban","#globalpolitics","#instagram","#who","#news","#bloggersofinstagram","#writingcommunity","#writingsociety","#blogpost"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1596709705,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 06 12:28:25 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Na≈° novi sagovornik u okviru serijala intervjua \"Kako ƒáe izgledati ICT poslovanje nakon pandemije korona virusa?\" bio je Dejan Saviƒá, direktor @atos_rs .\n\n#interviews #ict #ictindustry #ictbusiness #pandemic2020 #covid19 #economy #covid19impact #TAGmedia #rts1","NumberOfLikes":4,"Hashtags":["#interviews","#ict","#ictindustry","#ictbusiness","#pandemic2020","#covid19","#economy","#covid19impact","#TAGmedia","#rts1"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1596709688,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 06 12:28:08 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"@pchuafaletti & @jacquichuawarder\nPauline Chua-Faletti & Jacqui Chua\nManaged to install the new iPhone for mummy!

Virus ini memiliki tingkat mutasi yang tinggi dan merupakan patogen zoonotik yang dapat menetap pada manusia dan binatang dengan presentasi klinis yang sangat beragam, mulai dari asimptomatik, gejala ringan sampai berat, bahkan sampai kematian.\n\nSampai saat ini, belum terdapat terapi antiviral spesifik dan vaksin dalam penanganan COVID-19. Akan tetapi, beberapa terapi, seperti¬†remdesivir,¬†klorokuin\/hidroksiklorokuin, lopinavir-ritonavir, dan tocilizumab, sudah ditemukan memiliki efikasi dalam penanganan COVID-19 dan sudah masuk dalam uji coba klinis obat. Pasien COVID-19 dengan infeksi ringan umumnya hanya disarankan isolasi di rumah dan menggunakan obat yang dijual bebas untuk meredakan gejala. Pada pasien dengan infeksi berat, disarankan untuk dirawat inap dan terkadang diperlukan tindakan intubasi dan ventilasi mekanik apabila terjadi¬†gagal napas¬†atau¬†acute respiratory distress syndrome.\nJadi, mari saling mengingatkan agar pamdemi ini bisa segera berakhir dan segala aktivitas dapat normal kembali.\n\nWASH YOUR HANDS, STAY AT HOME, AND STAY HEALTHY!\n\n@hmj_matematikafmipa_unm @putrikharinam  @_vicarianti_ @syaribulan_ @agnesssd @miswarslh @muhammadsulfikar_\n@unhyy_kh29 \n\nSumber : https:\/\/www.alomedika.com\/penyakit\/penyakit-infeksi\/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19\n\n#dkmm2020 #coronavirus #coronavirusdisease #covid19 #pandemic #pandemic2020 #protokolkesehatan #washyourhands #stayathome #stayhealthy","NumberOfLikes":101,"Hashtags":["#dkmm2020","#coronavirus","#coronavirusdisease","#covid19","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#protokolkesehatan","#washyourhands","#stayathome","#stayhealthy"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1596688346,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 06 06:32:26 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"The Essential Touchless Keychain you need is still in stock! üåø‚ú®\n\u2022\nSHOP WITH US TODAY! \n\u2022\nüåç USA Free Shipping \n\u2022\nüì∏: @nikirighetti19 \n\u2022\nWww.essentialhealthcollection.com\n\u2022\n#essential \n#health \n#collection\n#essentialhealth\n#essentialhealthideas \n#essentialhealthsteps\n#essentialhealthwellness \n#essentialhealthcollection \n#essentialheathcollective \n#Stayconnected \n#blackgirlmagic\n#Blackentrepreneur\n#Blackentrepreneurs\n#Blackfemaleentrepreneur\n#womenpowerwomen\n#blackownedbusiness\n#contentquality \n#phoenix \n#Arizona \n#touchless \n#touchlesskeychain \n#touchlesskeytools \n#keychain \n#handsanitizer \n#covid19 \n#pandemic \n#pandemic2020 \n#pandemiccorona \n#germs \n#germfree","NumberOfLikes":9,"Hashtags":["#essential","#health","#collection","#essentialhealth","#essentialhealthideas","#essentialhealthsteps","#essentialhealthwellness","#essentialhealthcollection","#essentialheathcollective","#Stayconnected","#blackgirlmagic","#Blackentrepreneur","#Blackentrepreneurs","#Blackfemaleentrepreneur","#womenpowerwomen","#blackownedbusiness","#contentquality","#phoenix","#Arizona","#touchless","#touchlesskeychain","#touchlesskeytools","#keychain","#handsanitizer","#covid19","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#pandemiccorona","#germs","#germfree"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Essential Health Collection in Phoenix, Arizona.","NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1596688345,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 06 06:32:25 CEST 2020","Location":"Phoenix, Arizona"},{"CaptionText":"india is staring at the risk of losing its competitive advantage in vaccine manufacturing to other countries, biological e-chairperson said , even she also complained about lack of enough clinical trials sites and infrastructure in our country \n\n#covid19india #covid19 #coronavirus #pandemic2020 #pandemic  #lockdown # #socialdistancing #sanitizing #outbreak #economy #worldeconomy #indianeconomy #india","NumberOfLikes":7,"Hashtags":["#covid19india","#covid19","#coronavirus","#pandemic2020","#pandemic","#lockdown","#socialdistancing","#sanitizing","#outbreak","#economy","#worldeconomy","#indianeconomy","#india"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The Indian on August 05, 2020.

And these are BIG fears, aren\u2019t they? Not like your garden variety fears of the dark, bugs, or missed appointments.\n.\nSo¬†what do we do with our fear when it sits in the core of our soul¬†and¬†seeps¬†into every crevasse¬†within? Often deep fear is paralyzing, keeping us wrapped in a cocoon of¬†dread, anxiety and panic. Eleanor Roosevelt suggests looking fear in the face.¬†Since fear tends to find a home inside of us this glimpse¬†involves some inner consideration \u2013 a curiosity and even courage to explore the story our fears.¬†This is a first and important step. But the ultimate freedom from fear is found in giving each fear away \u2013 into the hands of One who asks for them.\n.\nOur Father in heaven implores us to give every worry to him because he really cares for us (1 Peter 5:7) and He can handle them. And He is not far removed from the deep fears that bind our hearts. He says, \u201CFor I am the\u202FLord\u202Fyour God who takes hold of your right hand and says to you,¬†Do¬†not fear; I will help you.\u201D¬†(Isaiah 41:13)\n.\nSo¬†what are you afraid of today?

We\u2019re in a pandemic, lots of people are working from home, it\u2019s uncertain if we\u2019re all going to have to endure another lockdown...and I\u2019m supposed to just WALK PAST the COOKIES?? Are you NUTS?? \n\nHere are some things I told myself the last 2 months when I was ready to give up:\n* Yes, I\u2019m sticking more closely with my healthy eating plan for now.  But it\u2019s only temporary.  When I\u2019m at my goal, there will be more balance and flexibility. \n* You started this for a reason, remember? \n* I love you too much to let you throw away a WEEK\u2019S worth of hard work.\n* Cookies will always be there.  It\u2019s okay to skip it for now. \n* My new self-care rule: I refuse to eat anything that is going to make me feel guilty or sick.  Right now, I would feel guilty and mad the next morning.\n\nEating Psychology 101: we are only capable of so many \u201Cgood\u201D decisions in one day.  After about the 10th time of saying \u201Cno\u201D to ourselves, we seek out a reward and are more likely to indulge in something that derails us, saying, \u201CI\u2019ve been good, I deserve the cookie.\u201D We are not dogs!  Why are we rewarding ourselves with food?  Don\u2019t get into a power struggle with yourself.  Have a kid bag up the cookies, and walk away.\n\nIt\u2019s super important to stay connected to why you\u2019re doing something healthy for yourself, especially in the beginning when the habit isn\u2019t quite established.  For me, I refuse to have a closet full of clothes that I can\u2019t fit into.  I refuse to just be content with the smile not reaching my eyes in the mirror.  I refuse to sit idly by while I destroy myself with my fork.\n\nDid this help?

This prevents taking it on and off or losing it)\n\u2022 Sanitizer often & before re entering  the vehicle \n\u2022 Allow a toy that is easily sanitized once home again. (This is key to keeping kids hands distracted from touching their face, Playing with their mask or touching anything in public) \n\u2022 Keep a blanket in the vehicle for impromptu picnics to avoid eating at restaurants\/patios \n\u2022 Atraining potty & wipes is also handy for longer outings to avoid the use of public restrooms. \n\u2022 Change clothes upon returning home and bath asap \n\nIF YOU HAVE A TIP PLEASE SHARE IN THE COMMENTS BELOW ‚è¨üòÉ‚è¨\n\n#parentingtips #parenting #pandemic #pandemic2020 #safetyfirst #wearamask #quarantinediaries #parenthood #parenthoodunplugged #mumof3 #parentinginapandemic #momlife #momswithcameras #picnic #socialdistancing #summertime #summer2020 #summer #scooter #scooterlife #staysafe #staysafeeveryone","NumberOfLikes":19,"Hashtags":["#parentingtips","#parenting","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#safetyfirst","#wearamask","#quarantinediaries","#parenthood","#parenthoodunplugged","#mumof3","#parentinginapandemic","#momlife","#momswithcameras","#picnic","#socialdistancing","#summertime","#summer2020","#summer","#scooter","#scooterlife","#staysafe","#staysafeeveryone"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1596661560,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 05 23:06:00 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Summer 2020....
