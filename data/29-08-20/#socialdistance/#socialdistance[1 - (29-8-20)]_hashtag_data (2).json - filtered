I don't know for how long this will go on, but research is pretty clear regarding the psychological and health effects of long-term social isolation. Depression and loneliness are perhaps the most immediate and easier to observe results of distancing kids from school and peers. \n\nBut there is much more going on.\nStudies like the one below, find that kids experiencing social isolation have higher levels of inflammation 40 years later. Similar studies in adults show a higher risk for health problems, including cardiovascular disease. Inflammation is now considered the biological basis for chronic disease. \n\nSo, when\/if the new waves of lockdowns hit, make sure you create as many interactive moments you can for your family. If you have 2 or more kids, it's hardly a problem, but for families with just one child, this is definitely more challenging. Just keep the facts in mind and make informed decisions for the overall wellbeing of your family.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0306453014003126\n\n\u2026\n#primalbaby #toxictruth #toxictruths #inflammation #socialisolation #isolation #social #childisolation #socialdistance #lockdown #toxin #psycologicaltoxin  #depression #fightdepression #loneliness #interaction #letkidsplay #healthykids #thrivingkids #nontoxichome #nontoxicliving #nontoxiclife #primal #naturalbaby #naturalbabycare #greenhome #ecohome #greenchild #naturalparenting #naturalparent","NumberOfLikes":2,"Hashtags":["#primalbaby","#toxictruth","#toxictruths","#inflammation","#socialisolation","#isolation","#social","#childisolation","#socialdistance","#lockdown","#toxin","#psycologicaltoxin","#depression","#fightdepression","#loneliness","#interaction","#letkidsplay","#healthykids","#thrivingkids","#nontoxichome","#nontoxicliving","#nontoxiclife","#primal","#naturalbaby","#naturalbabycare","#greenhome","#ecohome","#greenchild","#naturalparenting","#naturalparent"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Primal Baby on August 28, 2020 tagging @primalbaby.

Mjera zatvaranja teretana je bila nuzna jer u kolovozu je u teretanama toliko ljudi da ih vlasnici nogom guraju u teretanu da uspiju zatvoriti vrata. Opcepoznato je da ljeti, u 8. mjesecu svi stariji, kronicni bolesnici (za koje je COVID najopasniji) pohrle sa crkvenih liturgija gdje jedu dezinficirane hostije i piju iz posvecenih kaleza u teretane na Bench, a svi mladi sportasi koji inace treniraju se iz teretana prebace u crkvene klupe moliti se da ih Gospodin spasi od zaraze COVIDom. Tako je Stozer donio logicnu odluku i zatvorio teretane. Ova odluka spasit ce nemjerljiv broj ljudskih zivota koji ce sada umjesto u leglima zaraze moci sigurno putovati javnim prijevozom, partijati u klubovima, uzivati u kaficima i jesti u restoranima, moliti za oprost grijeha u crkvama.

We had some enthusiastic DSDs on board today. Since we love helping newbies explore the wonders of the ocean, it made our day! \n\nAnother milestone for us was finally being able to take a second boat out on the water. It\u2019s been five long months since we could do that. We\u2019re happy for these small victories as we learn new coping strategies and evolve into a new way of operating. The travel industry is far from getting back to normal and we still have a long and uncertain road ahead before we can even approach a semblance of what it used to be like. So being vocal for local from now on will really be a lifeline for so many who depend on tourism for their bread and butter. Until then, we have to make the best of what we have and grow together. \n\n📸 @parthi1993\n\n#socialdistance #diving#padi #ocean #travel #divinglife #scubaindia #discount #divelife #divingcourse #divingisfun #diving_photography #pondicherrydiaries #pondicherry #india #incredibleindia #travelindia #underwaterphotography #theseaweedisalwaysgreener #diveeducation #divetheory #divetheoryonline\n#distancelearning #elearning #quarantine #marinelifeofpondicherry #marinelifephotography","NumberOfLikes":132,"Hashtags":["#socialdistance","#divin","#padi","#ocean","#travel","#divinglife","#scubaindia","#discount","#divelife","#divingcourse","#divingisfun","#diving_photography","#pondicherrydiaries","#pondicherry","#india","#incredibleindia","#travelindia","#underwaterphotography","#theseaweedisalwaysgreener","#diveeducation","#divetheory","#divetheoryonline","#distancelearning","#elearning","#quarantine","#marinelifeofpondicherry","#marinelifephotography"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Temple Adventures -Dive School on August 28, 2020.

Thought I would share it with you all.\n\n\"We are just getting over an epidemic in Bristol. It is commonly called the \"Spanish Flu\". It is our duty to keep out of crowded halls. To avoid it we must get as much fresh air as possible, and have as much hot drink as you can afford. The common symptoms are red eyes and a headache. When people have these signs they should immediately be put to bed and isolated as soon as possible. You should give them a light diet. They should be kept as quiet as possible and cheerful. Always serve their food daintily and give them a little at a time. You must make light work for the doctor by getting the patient quite ready for him and not keeping him waiting, especially at the time when so many people had it altogether. I am very fortunate, as my two sisters have had influenza and I have not had it, though I went into their room and read to them. If proper treatment is not given, it is known to some people that it will develop into pneumonia.\n\n#spanishflu #flu #influenza #coronavirus #Bristol #schoolbook #edwardian #selfisolate #socialdistance","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#spanishflu","#flu","#influenza","#coronavirus","#Bristol","#schoolbook","#edwardian","#selfisolate","#socialdistance"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @prizebooksandpolitics on August 28, 2020.

Oh, I was retested 8\/13 (felt some better) & it came back negative (false negative btw). 8\/17 I developed the worse headache of my life & 8\/18 still had it so I went to the ER after a virtual visit with my  PCP.

It was really sad what I found in the first 30 minutes of being there. When I was younger the beaches used to be so much more clean, I used to be there every day and now I come back to the beaches as an adult and see how trashed it is. Fellow stoners are even leaving their trash. At first I just thought it was lazy people and leaving their kids toys behind. Then I started finding pairs of shoes, then capsules, foil wrappers, torches, lighters, and even multiple syringes. Not only is this not safe for us to walk around but the future generation, there were so many kids playing in the sand with no shoes of course, and that\u2019s where I found the most syringes which was very scary.

Fishers have long known that fish congregate around naturally occurring floating logs or other debris. This aggregating phenomenon suggested that floating objects aggregate fish because they provide a refuge from predators, a meeting place for schooling companions, a place of orientation, a feeding place, or that they duplicate natural aggregators. \n\nWrecks serve as seafloor features, attracting a wide variety of marine life. As different organisms colonize the wreck, a stable community of diverse plants and animals emerges. Plants and corals grow on the wreck\u2019s hard surfaces, while fish use the wreck as refuge from predators🦈\n\nThe trawler #wreck at Pondy disappeared below the surface about six months ago, just around the time of the lockdown. In its past life, it was a fishing trawler (so it\u2019s definitely doing more good for the environment now than it was before!) When lockdown lifted, we took the opportunity to visit and it is a great feature off the Pondy coast. Sunk at a depth of 35 m, it can be penetrated by deep divers who have done a Nitrox specialty. \nWant to visit, don't you 😍\n\n#socialdistance #diving#padi #ocean #travel #divinglife #scubaindia #discount #divelife #divingcourse #divingisfun #diving_photography #pondicherrydiaries #pondicherry #india #incredibleindia #travelindia #underwaterphotography #theseaweedisalwaysgreener #diveeducation #divetheory #divetheoryonline\n#distancelearning #elearning #quarantine #marinelifeofpondicherry #marinelifephotography","NumberOfLikes":101,"Hashtags":["#wreck","#socialdistance","#divin","#padi","#ocean","#travel","#divinglife","#scubaindia","#discount","#divelife","#divingcourse","#divingisfun","#diving_photography","#pondicherrydiaries","#pondicherry","#india","#incredibleindia","#travelindia","#underwaterphotography","#theseaweedisalwaysgreener","#diveeducation","#divetheory","#divetheoryonline","#distancelearning","#elearning","#quarantine","#marinelifeofpondicherry","#marinelifephotography"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Temple Adventures -Dive School on August 27, 2020.

But prayer is much different when done with a community, in a Holy Mass, amidst the serenity of a holy place. Before, we could even afford to miss this holy obligation. But suddenly, after months of deprivation, we miss that kind of worship, the Holy Eucharist, the echoing words of wisdom. We miss this kind of communion with God. Suddenly, we just can\u2019t wait to step inside a church again.\n\nIn this lyric essay, Sisang Batute expresses her deep yearning for this, particularly for the Holy Eucharist.
