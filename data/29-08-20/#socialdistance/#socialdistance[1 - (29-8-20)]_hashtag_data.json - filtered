I don't know for how long this will go on, but research is pretty clear regarding the psychological and health effects of long-term social isolation. Depression and loneliness are perhaps the most immediate and easier to observe results of distancing kids from school and peers. \n\nBut there is much more going on.\nStudies like the one below, find that kids experiencing social isolation have higher levels of inflammation 40 years later. Similar studies in adults show a higher risk for health problems, including cardiovascular disease. Inflammation is now considered the biological basis for chronic disease. \n\nSo, when\/if the new waves of lockdowns hit, make sure you create as many interactive moments you can for your family. If you have 2 or more kids, it's hardly a problem, but for families with just one child, this is definitely more challenging. Just keep the facts in mind and make informed decisions for the overall wellbeing of your family.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0306453014003126\n\n\u2026\n#primalbaby #toxictruth #toxictruths #inflammation #socialisolation #isolation #social #childisolation #socialdistance #lockdown #toxin #psycologicaltoxin  #depression #fightdepression #loneliness #interaction #letkidsplay #healthykids #thrivingkids #nontoxichome #nontoxicliving #nontoxiclife #primal #naturalbaby #naturalbabycare #greenhome #ecohome #greenchild #naturalparenting #naturalparent","NumberOfLikes":1,"Hashtags":["#primalbaby","#toxictruth","#toxictruths","#inflammation","#socialisolation","#isolation","#social","#childisolation","#socialdistance","#lockdown","#toxin","#psycologicaltoxin","#depression","#fightdepression","#loneliness","#interaction","#letkidsplay","#healthykids","#thrivingkids","#nontoxichome","#nontoxicliving","#nontoxiclife","#primal","#naturalbaby","#naturalbabycare","#greenhome","#ecohome","#greenchild","#naturalparenting","#naturalparent"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Primal Baby on August 28, 2020 tagging @primalbaby.

I was out at my weekly grocery run at 8 this morning minding my business. I noticed in the checkout line that a gentleman was behind me waiting his turn. The clerk greeted the person in  front of me and told him to have a great day. The person did not respond, grabbed his bags and left.\n\nI placed my items on the belt. The clerk and I exchanged greetings. We chatted while he scanned. Then he told me to have a great day and we exchanged goodbyes. The gentleman (everything but) behind me had only a few items so he checked out as I was getting situated off to the side. The clerk again cheerfully greeted the customer. No response. \n.\n.\n.\nAs you can probably detect by now this is one of my pet peeves. Why do people do this? I saw people in my hometown and my home state rioting because they could not leave their homes to be serviced by essential workers and yet they cannot give common courtesy.

Fishers have long known that fish congregate around naturally occurring floating logs or other debris. This aggregating phenomenon suggested that floating objects aggregate fish because they provide a refuge from predators, a meeting place for schooling companions, a place of orientation, a feeding place, or that they duplicate natural aggregators. \n\nWrecks serve as seafloor features, attracting a wide variety of marine life. As different organisms colonize the wreck, a stable community of diverse plants and animals emerges. Plants and corals grow on the wreck\u2019s hard surfaces, while fish use the wreck as refuge from predatorsü¶à\n\nThe trawler #wreck at Pondy disappeared below the surface about six months ago, just around the time of the lockdown. In its past life, it was a fishing trawler (so it\u2019s definitely doing more good for the environment now than it was before!) When lockdown lifted, we took the opportunity to visit and it is a great feature off the Pondy coast. Sunk at a depth of 35 m, it can be penetrated by deep divers who have done a Nitrox specialty. \nWant to visit, don't you üòç\n\n#socialdistance #diving#padi #ocean #travel #divinglife #scubaindia #discount #divelife #divingcourse #divingisfun #diving_photography #pondicherrydiaries #pondicherry #india #incredibleindia #travelindia #underwaterphotography #theseaweedisalwaysgreener #diveeducation #divetheory #divetheoryonline\n#distancelearning #elearning #quarantine #marinelifeofpondicherry #marinelifephotography","NumberOfLikes":95,"Hashtags":["#wreck","#socialdistance","#divin","#padi","#ocean","#travel","#divinglife","#scubaindia","#discount","#divelife","#divingcourse","#divingisfun","#diving_photography","#pondicherrydiaries","#pondicherry","#india","#incredibleindia","#travelindia","#underwaterphotography","#theseaweedisalwaysgreener","#diveeducation","#divetheory","#divetheoryonline","#distancelearning","#elearning","#quarantine","#marinelifeofpondicherry","#marinelifephotography"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Temple Adventures -Dive School on August 27, 2020.

Although stimulus talks continue to stall on Capitol Hill, it is important to know if YOU qualify for stimulus and unemployment payments once guidelines are set.

I\u2019m worried for all of the unemployed workers, who along with the live events\/performing arts industries are being left behind without the help they so desperately need.

It\u2019s been ages since we last met. We had a lovely lunch, couple of drinks and a long chat. But that\u2019s not what this post is going to be about.\n‚†Ä\nPandemic. Loads of people walking around without social distancing, arguing with bus drivers or us - flight attendants - about wearing the masks.\n‚†Ä\nYou may ask: do you really believe in the virus and entire pandemic?\nI am not sure. I am confused but I still assume it does, just in case. I choose to wear a mask to protect myself and others. Just in case. It\u2019s not said it doesn\u2019t exist, it\u2019s just a conspiracy theory it doesn\u2019t. Either I believe in it or not, it doesn\u2019t hurt me to cover my face with a light piece of cloth.\n‚†Ä\nEven if you don\u2019t believe in it, it does not hurt to wear a mask. What if you\u2019re wrong and it exists and you\u2019re spreading it around, pass it on more vulnerable people? Why are you so egoistic about it?\n‚†Ä\nLet me explain you a thing or two.\n‚†Ä\nThe mask doesn\u2019t necessarily protect you. It protects other from you. If two people wear them, the risk of potential carriage is very low. Much lower than without the mask. Either you believe in the virus or not.\n‚†Ä\nJust don\u2019t be an ass. Would you like someone to infect your loved ones, perhaps grandparents, before they weren\u2019t wearing a mask? Is that such a big deal to wear it?\n‚†Ä\nJust a bit more empathy, people.

As basses, we tend to sing affect our lower notes to sound more masculine, but often times what we hear in our head is not what is projected to others. This exercise is to add more brightness and resonance to my lower notes, which, in turn, keeps me in the right placement for when the melody breifly, but dramatically switches me into my higher register in the bridge. \nThe story behind the songs I cover are often part of the reason I choose them. This one struck a chord with me. Smith touches on his (apparently negative) relationship with his mother and stepfather and how it's mirrored in how he relates to women in his personal life. A gut-wrenchingly sad song from a truly tortured soul, always reverberating melancholy. A song almost ruined by a random pseudo-folk\/lounge cover done by actor\/singer, Minnie Driver, in 2014, which can honestly only be described, at best, as vocal masturbation. Incidentally, I like most of what I've seen\/heard from her but it was painfully obvious she had no emotional connection to the song and its meaning... which I personally appreciate more than cheap frills. But I digress.\nANYWAY, shout out to my man, Ian Richetti, who saw the potential musician in me like 15 or so years ago and burned me a mix CD (kids, if you don't know, ask your parents üòÇ) with this song on it. You introduced me to so many great tunes that were \"way more important than 'smells like teen spirit'\" (my musical obsession at the time üòÇ) which effectively formed my musical taste as a teenager. For that, I am still very grateful.\n\n#waltznumber2 #waltz2 #elliotsmith #xo #immilesfromhome #milesfromhome #quarantine #socialdistance #day41 #nycmusicians #brooklynmusicians #sadsongs","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#waltznumber2","#waltz2","#elliotsmith","#xo","#immilesfromhome","#milesfromhome","#quarantine","#socialdistance","#day41","#nycmusicians","#brooklynmusicians","#sadsongs"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598422968,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 26 08:22:48 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Covid 19 is still here!
