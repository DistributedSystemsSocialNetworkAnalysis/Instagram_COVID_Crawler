She's good at that. I think one story that illustrates her fortitude, pragmatism, humbleness, kindness, dedication, and leadership was after one of the first individuals in Richmond died... who also had COVID-19. The question was \u2013 what caused the death? Was it COVID-19 or something else? Late on a Friday afternoon, one of the physicians with whom she works asked her to find a teammate to go the morgue and \"swab\" a deceased individual to test for COVID-19. Since they didn't know much about the disease, all data was useful. She told her colleague that no one else on her team should have to do that and that she would take on that unsavory task herself.\u2060⠀\n\u2060⠀\n... this conveys how far Sara will go for others \u2013 both her team, patients, and community. That is only one minuscule aspect of the sacrifices she's made but illustrates perfectly who she is. Sara is a human, a leader, a nurse, and a member of our community. I wouldn't have anyone else as a LEADER during COVID-19. If you know a healthcare professional, you should thank them.

To hear that as a nurse, struck a nerve because nurses, as part of the healthcare community, are expected to have answers and\/or know what to do if we don't. BUT it doesn't change the fact I still can't do, fix, or solve it all.\n\nNo matter how good my intentions, level of intelligence, amount of compassion, or desire to help change things in healthcare, there will always be something that is outside my realm of control. I need to remember that no matter how chaotic, frustrating, discouraging, or hopeless life seems, God is in control all things and to lean on Him at all times for strength, peace, and wisdom instead of trying to figure out or do things on my own.\n\nAlso, real change in healthcare cannot be done by myself. To think otherwise, is prideful and completely disregards the other members in the healthcare community. EVERY department is IMPORTANT and ESSENTIAL - RNs, NPs, PAs, MDs, RT, PT\/OT\/ST, phlebotomy\/lab, EVS, RD, research, public health, and etc. \n\nWe are each unique to what we bring to the world of healthcare and we need to make sure that our voices are heard, individually and collectively. Not only on social media, but at the workplace, our communities, professional organizations, and at all elections. \n\n#publichealthsaveslives #publichealthmatters #coronavirus #covid19 #wearamask #washyourhands #socialdistance  #registerednurse #thatnurselife #nursing #travelnurse #travelnursing #publichealth #proudtobeanurse #nurselife #healthcareworkers #essentialworkers #peopleoverprofit #coronavirusisstilloutthere #healthcareprofessional #doyourpart #thisispublichealth #publichealthisessential #godisincontrol #godisfaithful #godgivemestrength #theserenityprayer #godisgoodallthetime #allthetimegodisgood #thoughtoftheday","NumberOfLikes":77,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by S a m m i e on August 04, 2020.

The future looked bleak and the news was dreadful and horrifying. \n\nWe took socially distancing very seriously and didn\u2019t see our families and friends for awhile. All restaurants and activities were temporarily closed, although some businesses might close for good. We went for runs\/walks around the neighborhood. Weekdays blended in with weekends. I experimented with new recipes, decorated our new house and stayed busy. Our Italy trip was cancelled and we were itching to go somewhere... anywhere to break up the monotony. So we decided to resume our high peaks adventures. We hiked up Big Slide Mountain. This time we were prepared and brought microspikes and used them for the first time during icy patches. They were very helpful especially coming downhill. Being outdoors surrounded by leaves blowing in the wind, the sound of birds singing and ice crunching under my shoes was so refreshing and calming.
