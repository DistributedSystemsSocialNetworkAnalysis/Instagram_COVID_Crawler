This generation of self-centered, self-entitled, selfish people who think they\u2019re incapable of contracting the virus. The gym was the ONLY sense of normalcy in my life and it was what was keeping me sane these past couple of weeks. Yes I can workout at home but it\u2019s just not the same, having a quick break away from home and daily mom life was extremely nice. Being able to spend quality time with my husband or gym partner was great for my mental health. I really hope more of you can join me in taking this more seriously, the least we could do is work together in slowing down the spread of the virus. Social gatherings and parties can surely wait, go for a walk, hike, spend quality time with your immediate family, learn a new recipe, but remember to save time for yourself. For me that\u2019ll be walks alone or maybe a quick at home workout in another room away from screaming children 😭😭 #quarantine #quarantinelife #gymlife #californialockdown #gymclosed #mentalhealth #selfcare #momswholift #girlswholift #fitmom #mentalhealthmatters #selfcarematters #covid19 #wearamask #socialdistance #dontbeselfish","NumberOfLikes":17,"Hashtags":["#quarantine","#quarantinelife","#gymlife","#californialockdown","#gymclosed","#mentalhealth","#selfcare","#momswholift","#girlswholift","#fitmom","#mentalhealthmatters","#selfcarematters","#covid19","#wearamask","#socialdistance","#dontbeselfish"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":9,"Timestamp":1596381340,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 02 17:15:40 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"breastcancerelemane","CaptionText":"Get your shirt now (link on my bio)\n#Repost @yolandacreations with @get_repost\nIf you like it...please Follow me to see more\nStay covered!

A series exploring the personal impact of quarantine. Virtual shoot. 5\/31\/2020.\n.\n\"So I looked up 'ennui'. I came across some sentiments I\u2019ve become particularly familiar with during this event. Unfulfilled (yup). Listlessness (oh yeah). Lassitude (had to look that one up, but also yes). A personal favorite: one of \u201Cthe blahs\u201D. I even read that the English word \u201Cannoy\u201D is derived from \u201Cennui\u201D, which seems pretty apropos. \u2060\n\u2060\nDuring my search, I came across another new term: \u201CWeltschmerz\u201D. A German word for \u201Cworld pain\u201D. A weariness that stems from a disconnect between your idealized image of the world and reality. An extrospective sadness informed by global circumstance and the inability to personally enact overwhelming positive change. \u2060\n\u2060\nI like that we can feel Weltschmerz. A pain for others. I like that we care enough to hurt. I believe we can do something with it. I hope we will.\"\u2060\n\u2060\n\u2060\nThoughts of @timcanali Sunday, May 31st, 2020. Illinois Week 13 since the beginning of the Quartine.\"\n.\nThis was originally posted back in May. Let's not allow our motivation and \"Weltschmerz\" to fade away just because our attention spans desensitize us from the severity of this pandemic. \n.\n#WearAMask #SocialDistance #Empathy #Weltschmerz #WorldPain #ForTheGreaterGood #photography #virtualphotoshoot #pandemic","NumberOfLikes":55,"Hashtags":["#WearAMask","#SocialDistance","#Empathy","#Weltschmerz","#WorldPain","#ForTheGreaterGood","#photography","#virtualphotoshoot","#pandemic"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Tim Canali on July 31, 2020 tagging @sdfmedianyc.
