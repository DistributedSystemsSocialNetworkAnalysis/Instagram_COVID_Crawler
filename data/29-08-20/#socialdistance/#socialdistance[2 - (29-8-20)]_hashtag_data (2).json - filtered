Het is verstandig om afstand van 1,5m te houden tot andere mensen, drukke plekken te vermijden, goed handen te wassen, eventueel aanvullende bescherming met een medisch mondkapje. Als u ergens binnen bent, zorg dan voor voldoende ventilatie. Vraag extra goed aan de mensen om u heen of ze echt geen klachten (ook geen milde klachten) hebben.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nMaar weeg ook mee wat belangrijk is voor u in het leven, een knuffel van een niet-ziek dierbaar persoon is een laag risico moment en kan soms zo belangrijk zijn!","NumberOfLikes":26,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1598428118,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 26 09:48:38 CEST 2020","Location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands"},{"CaptionText":"Confidence means the strength of character.

Homeschool parents, no judgment here!\n\nEach situation is different. Each student is different. And the decision each parent makes is individual to them, their child, and their situation.\n\nIs virtual learning for us? Probably not. My kids are too social, have too much energy, need interaction and adventure in their lives beyond what virtual learning can offer them.\n\nDoes that mean it won\u2019t work for everyone? That is wrong? No. I shared this today because I scroll my social media feed I see so many parents asking questions around homeschooling, complaining about virtual learning, trying to get answers for all the hard situations we find ourselves in as parents of young children.\n\nI don\u2019t have the answer, I wish they were an easy one size fits all solution, but there\u2019s not. But what I want to encourage you on today friends, is to make the best decision for YOU and YOUR CHILDREN! It doesn\u2019t matter what she\u2019s doing or his thoughts on this or that.

After my I Ching throw this week, I figured I would write a little about it from my Chinese Medicine perspective.  I always feel weird writing about this stuff because there\u2019s so much nuance I can\u2019t get to in a simple post.  I\u2019ve also included a book, The Lost Art of Compassion, because I\u2019m reading it this week.  Buddhist books meant for mass consumption are a little jarring because there\u2019s a lot of mixed metaphors and syncretism.\n\nAnyway, it\u2019s hard to be benevolent, kind, and compassionate right now.  Benevolence and kindness are the natural resolution of the Liver\/Gallbladder\u2019s assignment of Anger.  It takes a lot of energy to be kind in general, and most of the time, most can try or even fake it reliably because the Wood energy (Hun Spirit) isn\u2019t taxed quite so hard with the awareness of suffering\/empathy\/compassion\/tolerance.  No one can fake it now, because the Liver\/Gallbladder is stressed out, tense, and exhausted by planning for things that it can\u2019t possibly know.  The Wood complex does best with routine and predictable, appropriate novelty. \n\nPeople are doing their best.  Some people have more capacity in terms of Liver Blood, and this anchors some of the hot tempers, irritability, and judgement.  Alcohol (in suuuuuuper small amounts) moves Liver Qi and Blood; people are drinking too much of it and when they try to cut back, anxiety resurfaces leading to increased alcohol intake as well.  Fun!  I\u2019m not going to go on a rant here, because if you\u2019re my patient, you know how I feel about alcohol and medications in specific.  Maybe in a later post I\u2019ll indulge. Ha.\n\nThe Liver\/Gallbladder energy of Wood in the 5 Elements also implies flexibility, adaptability, courage, and expansion.  Right now, people who have a hard time adapting will simply be left behind or become irrelevant.  The improper Wood assertion, courage, and vision will not correctly inform or feed the fire element or Heart.  Moving forward with right action becomes impossible.","NumberOfLikes":82,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":6,"Timestamp":1598405295,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 26 03:28:15 CEST 2020","Location":"The Needle and Leaf"},{"CaptionText":"Join us this Friday, August 28th @ 7:00pm for our Parking Lot Practice Party!!

I do this by using film and allocating only two rolls of film per person, a maximum of 20 photographs per sitting. Every shot is carefully considered, far removed from working in the digital realm where an ability to shoot endless images removes the risk but also the magic. \n\nThe analog camera lens is for me a portal into a different way of seeing, a re-evaluation of how I feel about photography, which is ultimately just a way to connect with other humans.\n.\n.\n.\n\n#ballaratfoto #ballaratinternationalfotobiennale #visitballarat #bestofballarat #ballaratlife #whatsonballarat #visitvictoria #ballarat #photography #australianphotography #StayHome #PhotographersInIsolation #Pandemic #Covid19 #Coronavirus #massisolation #SocialDistance #Quarantine #TogetherAtHome #coronavirusaustralia #2020 #iso #newnormal","NumberOfLikes":69,"Hashtags":["#massisolationAUS","#ballaratfoto","#ballaratinternationalfotobiennale","#visitballarat","#bestofballarat","#ballaratlife","#whatsonballarat","#visitvictoria","#ballarat","#photography","#australianphotography","#StayHome","#PhotographersInIsolation","#Pandemic","#Covid19","#Coronavirus","#massisolation","#SocialDistance","#Quarantine","#TogetherAtHome","#coronavirusaustralia","#2020","#iso","#newnormal"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Mass Isolation Australia on August 25, 2020.

Givetvis kan vi förebygga så gott det går med alla restriktioner vi fått till oss). Psykisk ohälsa däremot har vi god kunskap om för att kunna förebygga och förhindra självmord.\n\nFinns massor var och en av oss kan bidra med för att hindra självmord.\n\nVad DU kan göra:\n▪︎Lyssna. Lyssna på den som mår dåligt och behöver någon att bara få prata med. Vem som helst kan lyssna. Du behöver inte ha någon kompetens eller komma med massa goda råd till någon som mår dåligt. Du behöver bara lyssna.\n\n▪︎Se\/bekräfta\/ge närhet\/erbjud trygghet\/lugna och trösta. En som mår dåligt i psykisk ohälsa är otroligt sårbar och det är det lilla barnet inom oss  som behöver tröst och hjälp. Vi med psykisk ohälsa känner oss hjälplösa, rädda och förtvivlade så som när man var ett litet barn. Enda man vill är att få trygghet. Erbjud den tryggheten genom att visa att du finns. Inte bara säga det, visa genom handling. Ofta stöter vi bort andra och isolerar oss för att vi tror att vi är en börda för andra och skäms för att be om hjälp. Ta initiativet och boka in en träff eller ring personen.\n\n▪︎Fråga personen vad den mår bra av. Försök hjälpa personen att göra mer av det hen mår bra av. Stötta! Stötta!\n\n▪︎Undvik att fastna för länge i personens orostankar. Kom ihåg att tankar är bara tankar. Inga absoluta sanningar. Hjälp personen genom att distrahera tankarna och kanske byta samtalsämne. Här behöver man dock ha lite känsla så man inte går för fort fram. Ändå viktigt att personen först fått prata av sig lite först då det känns som en absolut sanning för hen i dennes tankar.\n\n▪︎Ni vet ordspråket \"Hoppet är det sista som lämnar oss.\", precis så är det. Någon som är suicidal har helt och hållet tappat hoppet. Man ser helt enkelt ingen annan utväg än självmord. Här kan du vara den som inger hopp och visa att det finns andra alternativ än självmord. Du kan rädda liv genom att inge hopp när personen själv inte känner det!\n\nGivetvis finns det massa mer en kan göra. Fyll gärna på här i kommentarerna.

It is not inherited. And oftentimes, greatness isn't appreciated or recognised until you see greatness anywhere no more\u2063.\n\u2063\n🤫The secret of greatness lies within you. There is no discrimination from God. Anybody can be great. You have the formula of greatness inside you. It depends on you if you want to be great. If you want to be great, you can be great.\u2063\n\u2063\nThat secret recipe of greatness is inside you. There are so many souls inside you. Nothing is out of your reach. When you reach God, you will be at the pinnacle of your journey. That is the culmination.\u2063\n\u2063\nGreatness is not inherited.\u2063\n\u2063\n👨\u200D✈️ If your father is a pilot, do you assume you will be a pilot all by yourself, without any training or education? If your father is a great batsman, do you think you'll be a great batsman without making any effort? Why then do people think that if the father is a saint of God, then the son or daughter will be a saint of God too?\u2063\n\u2063\n❤️You will be a saint of God if God wants you to be his friend. It depends on God and you. Your family is not involved; the decision is taken by God. If God is willing, he will accept you as a friend. \u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n#ALRATV #GoharShahi #YounusAlGohar #sufi #sufism #agapelove #saint #fate #divinelove #lovequotes #divine #purification #compassion #greatness #selfesteem #selfimprovement #creation #Nirvana #higherself #theself #happiness #motivation #UniversalSufi #hope #socialdistance #hope #strength #positiveenergy #enlightenment #evolve","NumberOfLikes":0,"Hashtags":["#Repost","#ALRATV","#GoharShahi","#YounusAlGohar","#sufi","#sufism","#agapelove","#saint","#fate","#divinelove","#lovequotes","#divine","#purification","#compassion","#greatness","#selfesteem","#selfimprovement","#creation","#Nirvana","#higherself","#theself","#happiness","#motivation","#UniversalSufi","#hope","#socialdistance","#hope","#strength","#positiveenergy","#enlightenment","#evolve"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by abida adiba on August 25, 2020.

It is not inherited. And oftentimes, greatness isn't appreciated or recognised until you see greatness anywhere no more\u2063.\n\u2063\n🤫The secret of greatness lies within you. There is no discrimination from God. Anybody can be great. You have the formula of greatness inside you. It depends on you if you want to be great. If you want to be great, you can be great.\u2063\n\u2063\nThat secret recipe of greatness is inside you. There are so many souls inside you. Nothing is out of your reach. When you reach God, you will be at the pinnacle of your journey. That is the culmination.\u2063\n\u2063\nGreatness is not inherited.\u2063\n\u2063\n👨\u200D✈️ If your father is a pilot, do you assume you will be a pilot all by yourself, without any training or education? If your father is a great batsman, do you think you'll be a great batsman without making any effort? Why then do people think that if the father is a saint of God, then the son or daughter will be a saint of God too?\u2063\n\u2063\n❤️You will be a saint of God if God wants you to be his friend. It depends on God and you. Your family is not involved; the decision is taken by God. If God is willing, he will accept you as a friend. \u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n#ALRATV #GoharShahi #YounusAlGohar #sufi #sufism #agapelove #saint #fate #divinelove #lovequotes #divine #purification #compassion #greatness #selfesteem #selfimprovement #creation #Nirvana #higherself #theself #happiness #motivation #UniversalSufi #hope #socialdistance #hope #strength #positiveenergy #enlightenment #evolve","NumberOfLikes":48,"Hashtags":["#ALRATV","#GoharShahi","#YounusAlGohar","#sufi","#sufism","#agapelove","#saint","#fate","#divinelove","#lovequotes","#divine","#purification","#compassion","#greatness","#selfesteem","#selfimprovement","#creation","#Nirvana","#higherself","#theself","#happiness","#motivation","#UniversalSufi","#hope","#socialdistance","#hope","#strength","#positiveenergy","#enlightenment","#evolve"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Bilal Qasim on August 24, 2020.

It is not inherited. And oftentimes, greatness isn't appreciated or recognised until you see greatness anywhere no more\u2063.\n\u2063\n🤫The secret of greatness lies within you. There is no discrimination from God. Anybody can be great. You have the formula of greatness inside you. It depends on you if you want to be great. If you want to be great, you can be great.\u2063\n\u2063\nThat secret recipe of greatness is inside you. There are so many souls inside you. Nothing is out of your reach. When you reach God, you will be at the pinnacle of your journey. That is the culmination.\u2063\n\u2063\nGreatness is not inherited.\u2063\n\u2063\n👨\u200D✈️ If your father is a pilot, do you assume you will be a pilot all by yourself, without any training or education? If your father is a great batsman, do you think you'll be a great batsman without making any effort? Why then do people think that if the father is a saint of God, then the son or daughter will be a saint of God too?\u2063\n\u2063\n❤️You will be a saint of God if God wants you to be his friend. It depends on God and you. Your family is not involved; the decision is taken by God. If God is willing, he will accept you as a friend. \u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n#ALRATV #GoharShahi #YounusAlGohar #sufi #sufism #agapelove #saint #fate #divinelove #lovequotes #divine #purification #compassion #greatness #selfesteem #selfimprovement #creation #Nirvana #higherself #theself #happiness #motivation #UniversalSufi #hope #socialdistance #hope #strength #positiveenergy #enlightenment #evolve","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#ALRATV","#GoharShahi","#YounusAlGohar","#sufi","#sufism","#agapelove","#saint","#fate","#divinelove","#lovequotes","#divine","#purification","#compassion","#greatness","#selfesteem","#selfimprovement","#creation","#Nirvana","#higherself","#theself","#happiness","#motivation","#UniversalSufi","#hope","#socialdistance","#hope","#strength","#positiveenergy","#enlightenment","#evolve"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Spring on August 24, 2020.

That was really really not healthy for me(for you also) \nAlways remember that a part of social media is not real. \nThen I realised that I needed a break from all this. I went a step ahead to delete the app( now understand the level of addiction!😂)\nIn these five days, I did all the things to ease my mind and body. I challenge myself to do all the things without posting it as insta stories 😂🙈\nReading novels, listening to podcasts, \nReading about young entrepreneurs , Writing journals, listening to music, I even noticed my water intake 😂 \n.\n.\nWhy I\u2019m saying all these here is, you should manage your insta acc and don\u2019t let the insta acc to manage you...\nWhenever you feel like taking a break, plz do take!! (Don\u2019t worry about the followers count)\nBreak is necessary! Don\u2019t get overwhelmed by social media. \nThis is not real. \nRefreshing the computer(human body) is very very essential for a good run ♥️\n.\n.\n.\nMental health matters more than social media engagements. \n.\n.\n.\nStay safe♥️\n.\n.\n.\n#mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #mentalillness #socialmedia #socialdistance #socialmediadetox #socialmediadetoxing #creators #bloggerslife #chennaiinfluencer #chennaifashionblogger #chennaifashionbloggers #chennaiblogger #coimbatoreblogger #coimbatorefashionblogger #southindianblogger #southindian #staysafe","NumberOfLikes":178,"Hashtags":["#mentalhealth","#mentalhealthawareness","#mentalillness","#socialmedia","#socialdistance","#socialmediadetox","#socialmediadetoxing","#creators","#bloggerslife","#chennaiinfluencer","#chennaifashionblogger","#chennaifashionbloggers","#chennaiblogger","#coimbatoreblogger","#coimbatorefashionblogger","#southindianblogger","#southindian","#staysafe"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by 𝒀𝒖𝒗𝒂𝒔𝒓𝒊 𝑺𝒓𝒊𝒏𝒊𝒗𝒂𝒔𝒂𝒏 ✨ on August 24, 2020.

As many of you are aware, I hadn\u2019t left my house (apart from the occasional car ride to nowhere & one road trip to see the same two people I\u2019ve been seeing since June \u2014 my mom & sister) in six months. Saturday night, my sister rented out a movie theater so we could watch Harry Potter & the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone, alone. (It wasn\u2019t too pricey at all, by the way!) Seriously, it was just my husband, my sister, & myself. We watched a movie we\u2019ve seen a hundred times. We were by ourselves. We ate popcorn & drank soda that were unnecessarily expensive. It felt like I got some normalcy back, except for the mask-wearing, frequent washing of the hands, hand-sanitizing, remaining six-feet away from people I wasn\u2019t usually with, & legit flushing the public restroom toilet with my shoe (because I was not about to touch that nastiness with my hand). I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t have at least a few anxiety attacks as we pulled into the parking lot or while we made our way through the main lobby of the theater, but it felt good to get out a bit. Now, we\u2019re headed back to our home in New York, four hours away, where I\u2019ll remain until Rosh Hashana (the Jewish New Year) gets here. This little trip really did wonders for me.\n_\n\nCaptured by @remnantsofbrit.","NumberOfLikes":96,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by BRIT COHEN on August 24, 2020 tagging @westelm, @acolorstory, @amazonhome, and @remnantsofbrit.
