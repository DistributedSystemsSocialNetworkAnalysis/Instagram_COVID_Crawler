His career receiving numbers (71 Recs, 645 Yards, 5 TDs) aren\u2019t the best, but when you understand the level of WRs OSU deployed, they didn\u2019t need him to be an all-world receiving back. Last year, Dobbins had his best year yet - totaling 2,003 rushing yards off 301 attempts, and 21 rushing TDs. 👀\nOk, so now that we know THAT BOY GOOD, understand that he\u2019s going to be a top notch backup, handcuff, and overall fantasy commodity. Couple that with the fact that the Ravens\u2019 596 team carries were 98 more than the second place 49ers last year. Of course, a lot of those carries went to Jackson and Ingram, but with the recent news about Jackson\u2019s (not serious) injury age (30), Dobbins will undoubtedly carve out a nice role in the rushing attack. The Ravens also led the league in rushing yards with 3,296. They averaged over 200 yards per game. If Ingram misses time for whatever reason, Dobbins\u2019 value will skyrocket, and he\u2019s tailor made for a workload in an offense that will want to feed him early and often.

It is not inherited. And oftentimes, greatness isn't appreciated or recognised until you see greatness anywhere no more\u2063.\n\u2063\n🤫The secret of greatness lies within you. There is no discrimination from God. Anybody can be great. You have the formula of greatness inside you. It depends on you if you want to be great. If you want to be great, you can be great.\u2063\n\u2063\nThat secret recipe of greatness is inside you. There are so many souls inside you. Nothing is out of your reach. When you reach God, you will be at the pinnacle of your journey. That is the culmination.\u2063\n\u2063\nGreatness is not inherited.\u2063\n\u2063\n👨\u200D✈️ If your father is a pilot, do you assume you will be a pilot all by yourself, without any training or education? If your father is a great batsman, do you think you'll be a great batsman without making any effort? Why then do people think that if the father is a saint of God, then the son or daughter will be a saint of God too?\u2063\n\u2063\n❤️You will be a saint of God if God wants you to be his friend.

It is not inherited. And oftentimes, greatness isn't appreciated or recognised until you see greatness anywhere no more\u2063.\n\u2063\n🤫The secret of greatness lies within you. There is no discrimination from God. Anybody can be great. You have the formula of greatness inside you. It depends on you if you want to be great. If you want to be great, you can be great.\u2063\n\u2063\nThat secret recipe of greatness is inside you. There are so many souls inside you. Nothing is out of your reach. When you reach God, you will be at the pinnacle of your journey. That is the culmination.\u2063\n\u2063\nGreatness is not inherited.\u2063\n\u2063\n👨\u200D✈️ If your father is a pilot, do you assume you will be a pilot all by yourself, without any training or education? If your father is a great batsman, do you think you'll be a great batsman without making any effort? Why then do people think that if the father is a saint of God, then the son or daughter will be a saint of God too?\u2063\n\u2063\n❤️You will be a saint of God if God wants you to be his friend. It depends on God and you. Your family is not involved; the decision is taken by God.

It is not inherited. And oftentimes, greatness isn't appreciated or recognised until you see greatness anywhere no more\u2063.\n\u2063\n🤫The secret of greatness lies within you. There is no discrimination from God. Anybody can be great. You have the formula of greatness inside you. It depends on you if you want to be great. If you want to be great, you can be great.\u2063\n\u2063\nThat secret recipe of greatness is inside you. There are so many souls inside you. Nothing is out of your reach. When you reach God, you will be at the pinnacle of your journey. That is the culmination.\u2063\n\u2063\nGreatness is not inherited.\u2063\n\u2063\n👨\u200D✈️ If your father is a pilot, do you assume you will be a pilot all by yourself, without any training or education? If your father is a great batsman, do you think you'll be a great batsman without making any effort? Why then do people think that if the father is a saint of God, then the son or daughter will be a saint of God too?\u2063\n\u2063\n❤️You will be a saint of God if God wants you to be his friend. It depends on God and you. Your family is not involved; the decision is taken by God. If God is willing, he will accept you as a friend. \u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n#ALRATV #GoharShahi #YounusAlGohar #sufi #sufism #agapelove #saint #fate #divinelove #lovequotes #divine #purification #compassion #greatness #selfesteem #selfimprovement #creation #Nirvana #higherself #theself #happiness #motivation #UniversalSufi #hope #socialdistance #hope #strength #positiveenergy #enlightenment #evolve","NumberOfLikes":0,"Hashtags":["#Repost","#ALRATV","#GoharShahi","#YounusAlGohar","#sufi","#sufism","#agapelove","#saint","#fate","#divinelove","#lovequotes","#divine","#purification","#compassion","#greatness","#selfesteem","#selfimprovement","#creation","#Nirvana","#higherself","#theself","#happiness","#motivation","#UniversalSufi","#hope","#socialdistance","#hope","#strength","#positiveenergy","#enlightenment","#evolve"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by abida adiba on August 25, 2020.

Thanks to all APAG members and volunteers who participated in this noble cause. \n\nSpecial thanks to Queens Borough President Elect @drichardsnyccouncil and Assemblymember David Weprin for attending and distributing backpacks and school supplies. \n\nAPAG will continue to work and collaborate to assist communities in need and make sure communities get counted in the upcoming Census 2020. @uscensusbureau \n\n#APAG #advocacy #communityservice #backtoschool #bookbags #schoolsreopening  #SchoolsAndCommunitiesFirst \u202C #schoolsupplies #socialservice #socialwelfare #staysafe #wearmask #socialdistance #washhands #engage #empower #elevate","NumberOfLikes":189,"Hashtags":["#APAG","#advocacy","#communityservice","#backtoschool","#bookbags","#schoolsreopening","#SchoolsAndCommunitiesFirst","#schoolsupplies","#socialservice","#socialwelfare","#staysafe","#wearmask","#socialdistance","#washhands","#engage","#empower","#elevate"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598364508,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 16:08:28 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"✨Personalized Property Management✨⠀\n\u2022⠀\nEvery home is unique \u2013 that\u2019s why we listen to your needs as an Owner above all else.⠀\n\u2022⠀\nWith us, you will have access to a designated property manager 24\/7, along with a skilled housekeeping team who know the special qualities of your home and inspect it regularly.⠀\n\u2022⠀\nYour guests will always have a team to call \u2013 sit back and relax, we\u2019ll take care of the rest!⠀\n\u2022⠀\nLearn more how iTrip Park City can help you earn more and worry less.

I'd like to say I've had worse houseguests, but that would be a stretch. There are some lessons to be shared:\n\nFirst, continue all the efforts you are already taking to maintain social distancing, practice thorough and frequent hand-washing, and get adequate rest. Wear a mask if out in shared public spaces.\n\nSecondly, if you or a family member develop symptoms that are suspicious (fever, cough, headache or extreme fatigue and muscle aches), or believe you have been exposed to the coronavirus, don't panic, call the Ministry of Health\n\nThirdly, if you or a family member is diagnosed, you are certainly allowed to feel frightened, and it is also necessary to do a reality check. This is a scary illness, and most people are able to get through it at home with support and guidance from health professionals. The symptoms are no picnic, but in most cases can be managed at home with simple measures and supportive care from the healthcare system.\nWe've all had the flu, or at least most of us have. What makes COVID-19 different is it lingers longer, and the symptoms come and go in unpredictable ways. A good day can be followed by a bad day, followed by something in between.

Stalking some random pages, getting excited when people uploaded something new. And after that I started worrying about my social performance. Self-criticism hit hard on me. That was really really not healthy for me(for you also) \nAlways remember that a part of social media is not real. \nThen I realised that I needed a break from all this. I went a step ahead to delete the app( now understand the level of addiction!😂)\nIn these five days, I did all the things to ease my mind and body. I challenge myself to do all the things without posting it as insta stories 😂🙈\nReading novels, listening to podcasts, \nReading about young entrepreneurs , Writing journals, listening to music, I even noticed my water intake 😂 \n.\n.\nWhy I\u2019m saying all these here is, you should manage your insta acc and don\u2019t let the insta acc to manage you...\nWhenever you feel like taking a break, plz do take!!

As many of you are aware, I hadn\u2019t left my house (apart from the occasional car ride to nowhere & one road trip to see the same two people I\u2019ve been seeing since June \u2014 my mom & sister) in six months. Saturday night, my sister rented out a movie theater so we could watch Harry Potter & the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone, alone. (It wasn\u2019t too pricey at all, by the way!) Seriously, it was just my husband, my sister, & myself. We watched a movie we\u2019ve seen a hundred times. We were by ourselves. We ate popcorn & drank soda that were unnecessarily expensive. It felt like I got some normalcy back, except for the mask-wearing, frequent washing of the hands, hand-sanitizing, remaining six-feet away from people I wasn\u2019t usually with, & legit flushing the public restroom toilet with my shoe (because I was not about to touch that nastiness with my hand). I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t have at least a few anxiety attacks as we pulled into the parking lot or while we made our way through the main lobby of the theater, but it felt good to get out a bit. Now, we\u2019re headed back to our home in New York, four hours away, where I\u2019ll remain until Rosh Hashana (the Jewish New Year) gets here.

La creatividad es un hábito, y  el mejor creativo es el resultado de buenos hábitos que incluyen la imaginación y la innovación. Nuestro diálogo interno a veces es un crítico severo.
