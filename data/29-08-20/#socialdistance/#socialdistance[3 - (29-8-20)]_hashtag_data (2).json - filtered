Dr Fiona Rennie, our Family Medicine Specialist, shares these tips;\n\nConsult with your School about the measures that have been put in place to put your mind at ease. Then spend time in the coming week discussing, and practising scenarios that your child may face to make sure they are well prepared. \n\nBy now we are sure you have mastered the hand-washing technique but nows the time to re-enforce good hand washing technique and remind your child of all the times that they should wash their hands - no matter the age, reminding them will do no harm. \n\nPlace some hand sanitizer in their school bags. One that has a  holder that hangs off the school bag, so it's always visible and easy to use is also a good idea. Encourage frequent use. \n\nMasks, of course, are required, Dr Fiona advises that fabric masks are adequate for children who are considered low-risk. If your child has a pre-existing condition, then it is advisable to consider using medical masks. Make sure your child has 1-2 extra masks in their bag in case thiers is misplaced. \n\nPlease speak to your children about what social distancing means, you will be surprised how much even little ones can comprehend simple things such as keeping distance between them. \n\nAn essential one, if your child shows signs of a fever or is unwell, do not send them to School. \n\nAfter such a long time out of School, your child might struggle to get back into the routine, plus with so many changes, it can be understandable. The most important things to help them through this adjustment period is proper nutrition, adequate sleep and supportive parents. \n\nLast but certainly not least, it's a big one. Vaccinations. If COVID has taught us anything, its what damage a virus can do without a vaccine. If you haven't already booked in with your Family Medicine Specialist to get your children's vaccinations up to date now is the time. You may also like to speak to them about the flu vaccine as we enter the season.\n\n#familymedicine\n#backtoschool \n#genesis \n#healthcare \n#covidtips","NumberOfLikes":7,"Hashtags":["#familymedicine","#backtoschool","#genesis","#healthcare","#covidtips"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Genesis Healthcare Center in Genesis Healthcare Center.","NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598163795,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 08:23:15 CEST 2020","Location":"Genesis Healthcare Center"},{"Owner":"taaaa","CaptionText":"依家煮飯,最緊要係咩呀?🍝\nIGable😏\n#homemade #carbonara #spegetti #creamspinich #searedsalmon #igable #dinner #colourful #killstime #dayoff #stayathome #socialdistance #hkig #hkiger #hkgirls #cured #daily #life #852 #如果媽媽都玩ig #留在家 #個個都可以變廚神","NumberOfLikes":30,"Hashtags":["#homemade","#carbonara","#spegetti","#creamspinich","#searedsalmon","#igable","#dinner","#colourful","#killstime","#dayoff","#stayathome","#socialdistance","#hkig","#hkiger","#hkgirls","#cured","#daily","#life","#852","#如果媽媽都玩ig","#留在家","#個個都可以變廚神"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by SitaC. on August 23, 2020.

Having a boat allows you to feel like you have had a great break even after a day out on the water, melting the stress away and invigorating the soul with the lapping sounds of the ocean and sun on your face.⠀\n⠀\nAnd don't forget it's been scientifically proven that that getting out on the water promotes a more restful state, with many benefits  both psychologically and physiologically.  A state referred to as the \"blue mind.\" ⠀\n⠀\nSo when it comes down to it, boating isn\u2019t merely just a past time\u2014it\u2019s a lifestyle.

The one thing that I have enjoyed about our current reality is being able to drop into several different yoga studios via Zoom. My current rotation is @mettamovesme, @samudrastudioyoga and @presence_of_mind_maine. For the first time in years, I've gotten back into a solid practice routine. In some ways, our need to #socialdistance allows for greater accessibility. I hope that is something that remains, whenever we move beyond the #pandemic.\n\nAfter class, I did some deep cleaning while listening to music. Saturday morning cleaning with music is what I grew up with and it's grounding. Afterwards, I light incense and it takes me back to my childhood.\n\n While I don't like to cook, I actually don't mind cleaning. I hate clutter and it feels so good to shower up after cleaning and just sit in the stillness of a clean house. \n\nA few minutes ago, I went out to check the tomatoes and they are coming along. I suspect I'll roast them and turn them into a sauce. Though a few fried green tomatoes would be lovely. \n\nIt's a lazy, late summer day. It almost feels normal. I guess we can create moments of normal even in the chaos. These normal moments are what keep me grounded and rooted to my truth and my own humanity. \n\nMay your day be blessed with moments of normal. #coviving #pandemicmusings #coronavirusdiarys #anewnormal #survivingduringcorona #createthelifeyouwant #home #midlifetransition #dailyreflections #dailyrythm #maineislandlife #growfood #homegarden #bgimchronicles","NumberOfLikes":474,"Hashtags":["#lifeduringapandemic","#ashtangayoga","#socialdistance","#pandemic.","#coviving","#pandemicmusings","#coronavirusdiarys","#anewnormal","#survivingduringcorona","#createthelifeyouwant","#home","#midlifetransition","#dailyreflections","#dailyrythm","#maineislandlife","#growfood","#homegarden","#bgimchronicles"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":9,"Timestamp":1598133841,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 00:04:01 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"quianaabner","CaptionText":"Datenight with @motor_city_mel \nDecided on @down_on_grayson\nat The Pearl near downtown San Antonio.

Fakat Capitol Avm'ye gidip daha fazla fastfood yemektense hand-made bir burger yemek isterim diyenler için Ora Burger incelememiz geliyor. 😊\n\nOra Burger'in uzun dönem önünden geçtim fakat o zamanlar öğrenci olmam sebebiyle hiç girmeye cesaret edemedim. Bir gün kapısına astıkları belli saatler arasındaki indirimli menüleri ile ben de hemen denemek için içeri girdim. Şu anda da İstanbul'a geldiğim gibi ilk uğradığım yer oldu. Ora Burger'in köftesi son derece lezzetli ve ekmeği yumuşacık geliyor. Tüm burgerler menü şeklinde servis ediliyor. Yanında baharatlı patates ve içeceğinizi ücretsiz olarak alabiliyorsunuz. Pandemi öncesinde yemeğiniz hazırlanırken masanıza yer fıstığı ikram ediliyordu fakat şu an yok. Hatta masaya servis tamamen kalkmış. Oturduğunuz zaman masanın üstünde bulunan karekodlar ile siparişinizi veriyorsunuz. Panoda masa numarası yandığı zaman ise gidip alabiliyorsunuz. Bir tür self-servis sistemi uygulanıyor. Eskiden ev yapımı ayran ve ice-tea seçeneği vardı ve son derece lezzetliydi. Pandemi bitince muhakkak ev yapımı ice-tea içmeye gelmelisiniz.\n\nOra Burger hizmet ve ilgi son derece yüksek. Bir çok defa gittim ve bu zamana kadar hiçbir sorun yaşamadım. Mekanın tasarımı ise son derece ferah. Yüksek tavanlı geniş bir yapısı var. Bahçe kısmı da bulunuyor fakat yol kenarında olması sebebiyle bahçesinin fazla rahat olduğunu söyleyemeyeceğim. Hand-made burger restoranlarında her yerde fazlaca bulunan inek figürlerini ben çok hoş bulmuyorum. Burada da hiç yok diyemem ama abartılmamış. Geçen yıllardaki kampanyası devam etmiyor ve burger ücretleri 35-40 TL civarında. Umarım kampanyalar tekrar başlar ve biz de seve seve faydalanırız. \n\n#oraburger #steak #burger #cheeseburger #instafood #istanbul #altunizade #uskudar #üsküdar #food #foodphotography #dinner #sunday #funday #instasummer #meat #socialdistance #distance","NumberOfLikes":22,"Hashtags":["#oraburger","#steak","#burger","#cheeseburger","#instafood","#istanbul","#altunizade","#uskudar","#üsküdar","#food","#foodphotography","#dinner","#sunday","#funday","#instasummer","#meat","#socialdistance","#distance"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1598091780,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 12:23:00 CEST 2020","Location":"Ora's Steak & Burgers"},{"Owner":"zackselectronicszimbabwe","CaptionText":"THE BIGGER THE BETTER!!!!!! \n\n70\"-$1500\n\nThe Specs:\n\n1. 4K ULTRA HD SMART LED TV\n2.

Und der müssen wir uns stellen. So wie Dr. MITHU MELANIE SANYAL, Mutter, Autorin, Journalistin und Kulturwissenschaftlerin.\n\nWoher nehmen Sie die Energie für Ihren Kampfgeist? Darf ich eine Frage zurück stellen? Stellen Sie Ihre männlichen Porträtierten auch als Mutter \u2013 in diesem Fall dann: Vater \u2013 vor? Nun stimmt es, dass ich Mutter bin, das möchte ich auch gar nicht wegkürzen, aber ist das eine Qualifikation? Und wenn ja, für was? Deshalb überspringe ich jetzt Ihre weitere Fragen und beantworte nur die letzte und vielleicht stelle ich mich damit ein wenig vor, oder zumindest einige der Themen, über die ich schreibe und denke. \n\nWie groß ist die Macht der Worte? Wenn man sein Leben damit verbringt, sich gratulieren zu lassen, wie gut man doch Deutsch spricht, bleibt es nicht aus, dass man sich den einen oder anderen Gedanken über die Natur der Worte macht. Wo kommen sie her? Wo gehen sie hin? Und vor allem, was heißt hier eigentlich gut? Es ist ja nicht so, dass die Gratulanten allesamt Lispler oder Stotterer wären. Der einzige Unterschied zwischen ihnen und mir besteht darin, dass ich beige bin und sie --- aber meine Mutter hat mir beigebracht, dass man nicht über die Hautfarbe von anderen Menschen spricht. Meine Haut hat in etwa den Ton von Tee mit einem Tropfen Milch: beige halt. In Verbindung mit dunklen Haaren rechnet sich das anscheinend zu braun hoch und damit zu einem internationalen Reisepass. Willkommen in der Postmoderne. Aber sogar Leute, die qua Job Experten in Sachen Ausweispapiere sein sollten, sind jedes Mal wieder baff erstaunt, dass mein Liebster zwar weiß ist aber nicht deutsch, während ich einen deutschen Pass besitze, aber wie gesagt beige bin. Die einzige Strategie, um am Flughafen nicht eine Ewigkeit vor dem Glashäuschen stehen zu müssen, in dem ein Herr reglos wie Schneewittchen meinen Reisepass auswendig lernt, wurde von meinem Leidensgenossen Hartmut El Kurdi auf die Formel gebracht: \u201EHast du nen Neger mit dabei, bist du dem Zöllner einerlei.\u201C Oder wissenschaftlicher: [Fortsetzung in den Kommentaren]","NumberOfLikes":49,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Hartmut S.
