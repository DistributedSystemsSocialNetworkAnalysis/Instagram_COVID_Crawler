Dr Fiona Rennie, our Family Medicine Specialist, shares these tips;\n\nConsult with your School about the measures that have been put in place to put your mind at ease. Then spend time in the coming week discussing, and practising scenarios that your child may face to make sure they are well prepared. \n\nBy now we are sure you have mastered the hand-washing technique but nows the time to re-enforce good hand washing technique and remind your child of all the times that they should wash their hands - no matter the age, reminding them will do no harm. \n\nPlace some hand sanitizer in their school bags. One that has a  holder that hangs off the school bag, so it's always visible and easy to use is also a good idea. Encourage frequent use. \n\nMasks, of course, are required, Dr Fiona advises that fabric masks are adequate for children who are considered low-risk. If your child has a pre-existing condition, then it is advisable to consider using medical masks. Make sure your child has 1-2 extra masks in their bag in case thiers is misplaced. \n\nPlease speak to your children about what social distancing means, you will be surprised how much even little ones can comprehend simple things such as keeping distance between them. \n\nAn essential one, if your child shows signs of a fever or is unwell, do not send them to School. \n\nAfter such a long time out of School, your child might struggle to get back into the routine, plus with so many changes, it can be understandable. The most important things to help them through this adjustment period is proper nutrition, adequate sleep and supportive parents. \n\nLast but certainly not least, it's a big one. Vaccinations. If COVID has taught us anything, its what damage a virus can do without a vaccine. If you haven't already booked in with your Family Medicine Specialist to get your children's vaccinations up to date now is the time. You may also like to speak to them about the flu vaccine as we enter the season.\n\n#familymedicine\n#backtoschool \n#genesis \n#healthcare \n#covidtips","NumberOfLikes":7,"Hashtags":["#familymedicine","#backtoschool","#genesis","#healthcare","#covidtips"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Genesis Healthcare Center in Genesis Healthcare Center.","NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598163795,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 08:23:15 CEST 2020","Location":"Genesis Healthcare Center"},{"Owner":"beyondfitnessgr","CaptionText":"We Are Back, with additional social distancing and safety measures in place.\nHurry up to book your weekly workouts because limited space will be available in each class. \nCall us, use our Online booking App or send as a message!\nNot just a gym.

А за последнюю неделю с приездом студентов, вместе с их родителями, \"наш ауыл\" обратно ожил. Это нас радует, хоть мы и не знакомы. Но один факт нас все же тревожил весь последний месяц. Как будут обстоять дела с вирусом? С потоком людей..Ну вы понимаете... \n\n▪️Сначала говорили, что студентов будут тестить каждые 2 недели. А сейчас ничего об этом не слышно. \n\n▪️Но на территорий кампуса @virginia.tech каждый обязан ходить в масках. Однако есть разные люди, кто то носит, а кто то не считает это нужным.\n\n▪️Хорошо что на кампусе можно взять бесплатную маску с символом нашего универа. Будем надеяться, что студенты будут очень осторожны, и соблюдать все правила.\n\n▪️А сегодня проезжая мимо даунтауна(центр) @downtownblacksburg , я увидела табличку с надписью \"маски обязательны на даунтауне города\". Конечно, неудивительно, ведь это место скопления людей. Хотя нет, я не ожидала такого поворота. \n\n▪️В начале августа началась учеба в школах в некоторых штатах. В одной из них, ученики не стали соблюдать положенную дистанцию. Так, выявились несколько заболевших из разных классов. Жалко детей :(\n\n◾️В целом, и школы и садики открываются. Но родители и дети сами решают будут они онлайн учиться или же оффлайн. Короче, как захотят.\n\n▪️Дети до 3х лет могут ходить без масок. Я так рада, что наша дочь попала в эту категорию.\n\n▪️Не узнавала дают ли штраф, но думаю, все правила на законодательном уровне. По крайней мере, ношения масок внтури здания является таковым. \n\nНа фото я такая серьезная, уставшая, и очень нехотевшая носить эту мед.маску. В ней мне не легко дышать. Поэтому приобрела другую 3D версию, из льна и хлопка.

FLAW even started the #ProtectTheVulnerable campaign to help encourage everyone to stay home and help keep those populations safe. But this narrative quickly changed as communities of color were disproportionately affected, children and teenagers became sick, celebrities lost their lives and now as the United States\u2019 cases have doubled in six weeks to over 4 million - one thing has become clear: WE ARE ALL VULNERABLE. \u2063\u2063⠀\n\u2063\u2063⠀\nAt Fight Like A Warrior we believe it is time to come together (metaphorically of course 😉) and wear our masks not for the good of one person or population, but because our nation and world will never get to heal if we do not. \u2063\u2063⠀\n\u2063\u2063⠀\nOne person dies of COVID-19 in the U.S. alone about every 80 seconds . Fellow non-profit coalition parters, doctors, nurses, teachers, chronic illness warriors, and more are coming together to take part in #WeAreAllVulnerable and pledge to wear a mask.\u2063⠀\n\u2063⠀\nJOIN US: \u2063⠀\n\u2063\u2063⠀\n1.

Und der müssen wir uns stellen. So wie Dr. MITHU MELANIE SANYAL, Mutter, Autorin, Journalistin und Kulturwissenschaftlerin.\n\nWoher nehmen Sie die Energie für Ihren Kampfgeist? Darf ich eine Frage zurück stellen? Stellen Sie Ihre männlichen Porträtierten auch als Mutter \u2013 in diesem Fall dann: Vater \u2013 vor? Nun stimmt es, dass ich Mutter bin, das möchte ich auch gar nicht wegkürzen, aber ist das eine Qualifikation? Und wenn ja, für was? Deshalb überspringe ich jetzt Ihre weitere Fragen und beantworte nur die letzte und vielleicht stelle ich mich damit ein wenig vor, oder zumindest einige der Themen, über die ich schreibe und denke. \n\nWie groß ist die Macht der Worte? Wenn man sein Leben damit verbringt, sich gratulieren zu lassen, wie gut man doch Deutsch spricht, bleibt es nicht aus, dass man sich den einen oder anderen Gedanken über die Natur der Worte macht. Wo kommen sie her? Wo gehen sie hin? Und vor allem, was heißt hier eigentlich gut? Es ist ja nicht so, dass die Gratulanten allesamt Lispler oder Stotterer wären. Der einzige Unterschied zwischen ihnen und mir besteht darin, dass ich beige bin und sie --- aber meine Mutter hat mir beigebracht, dass man nicht über die Hautfarbe von anderen Menschen spricht. Meine Haut hat in etwa den Ton von Tee mit einem Tropfen Milch: beige halt. In Verbindung mit dunklen Haaren rechnet sich das anscheinend zu braun hoch und damit zu einem internationalen Reisepass. Willkommen in der Postmoderne. Aber sogar Leute, die qua Job Experten in Sachen Ausweispapiere sein sollten, sind jedes Mal wieder baff erstaunt, dass mein Liebster zwar weiß ist aber nicht deutsch, während ich einen deutschen Pass besitze, aber wie gesagt beige bin. Die einzige Strategie, um am Flughafen nicht eine Ewigkeit vor dem Glashäuschen stehen zu müssen, in dem ein Herr reglos wie Schneewittchen meinen Reisepass auswendig lernt, wurde von meinem Leidensgenossen Hartmut El Kurdi auf die Formel gebracht: \u201EHast du nen Neger mit dabei, bist du dem Zöllner einerlei.\u201C Oder wissenschaftlicher: [Fortsetzung in den Kommentaren]","NumberOfLikes":49,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Hartmut S.

Even though there is a mask mandate in most states, we can all understand and relate to the fact that it can be hard to supervise children in a school setting. Portable Acrylic Desk Shields are one preventative solution that schools have been using to possibly curb mass infection rates in schools.\n🦠 🦠 🦠 \nThe installation of physical barriers is a recommendation made by the CDC to prevent direct contact amongst people. These barriers have made their way to retail stores, offices, and restaurants. Installing clear physical barriers in schools preserve communication between students and teachers and keeps collaboration amongst students in-tact.\n👩\u200D🎓🧑\u200D🎓👨\u200D🎓\nEven though many schools are providing parents & students with virtual learning options, in-person learning has a significant effect on children. It helps build communication skills, makes education interactive, boosts creativity and helps students in problem solving.\n😷 😷 😷 \nThe protection of our children is highly important. The mortality rate and severity of COVID-19 is not high amongst children, but that does not mean that they don\u2019t become carriers of the disease. A lot of children spend time with their grandparents and parents who might be older, which are at higher risk. That\u2019s precisely why children too, need to be protected from being exposed to COVID-19.\n👨\u200D👩\u200D👦\u200D👦👩\u200D👩\u200D👦\u200D👦👨\u200D👩\u200D👧\u200D👧👩\u200D👩\u200D👧\u200D👧\nIf you are still looking for sneeze guards for schools, we can help you.

Nursing homes with primarily Black and Latinx residents have nearly double the rate of COVID-19 infections than nursing homes with the same proportion of non-Hispanic whites. The long-standing mistrust between minorities and the public health system also impacts whether minorities feel it is necessary to get a vaccine once one is made available; only 25% of Black Americans and 37% of Latinx Americans surveyed are willing to take a vaccine for COVID-19. Partnering with community leaders and historically-Black academic institutions is one way we can close this health gap and bring more equitable care during the pandemic. \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n#covidsms #covid19 #covid #coronavirus #socialdistancing #stayathome #socialdistance #publichealth #pandemic #testingsites #unemployment #resources #foodbanks #food #foodresources #spanish #latino #latinx #language #informationaccessibility","NumberOfLikes":17,"Hashtags":["#covidsms","#covid19","#covid","#coronavirus","#socialdistancing","#stayathome","#socialdistance","#publichealth","#pandemic","#testingsites","#unemployment","#resources","#foodbanks","#food","#foodresources","#spanish","#latino","#latinx","#language","#informationaccessibility"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by CovidSMS on August 20, 2020.
