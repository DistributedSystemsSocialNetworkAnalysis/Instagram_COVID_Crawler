Parents with kids in the school system are overwhelmed and don\u2019t know the right move. University\/college students are afraid their (in many cases) lesser online education will hurt them down the line. People with chronic illness are on even LONGER wait times and anxious to enter hospitals to see necessary specialists. Individuals and families are locked into houses they\u2019re long done with because almost no one can afford this market. People still aren\u2019t able to see their grandparents. Friends are doing going in for chemo alone. On top of all of that, life still goes on. People are still dealing with loss and grief and addiction and mental illness and discouragement and loneliness and family breakdown and deteriorating health and xyz. \n\nIf this pandemic doesn\u2019t bring us back to our roots as individuals and communities, I cannot imagine a more grandiose waste. \n\nMy honest to god prayer to the heavens and the earth is that this year radically changes us and makes us genuinely kinder and more socially active human beings. May we please start actually attending funerals for people other than immediate family. May we bake and cook for those mourning and celebrating and grieving and achieving. May we make it second nature to put ourselves in someone else\u2019s shoes and have empathy instead of judgment. May we commit to the education and betterment of ourselves and always be learning and improving in order to properly show up to this ever changing world of ours. May we open up our living rooms (or backyards #socialdistance) to those who need someone. May we physically show up with every capacity we have instead of just sending well wishes with our thumbs. May we not demonize being \u201Cpolitical\u201D and instead actively concern ourselves with things of value and weight. May we pay it forward at Tim Hortons. May we share our favourite nature spots with loved ones. \n\nMy God may we love.","NumberOfLikes":24,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by rebekah richardson on August 18, 2020.

For patients recovering at home, treatment is mainly #supportive. For people with #mild symptoms, this means staying well rested, drinking plenty of fluids, and monitoring symptoms. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever or chills, cough, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, runny nose or congestion, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea. Some people have more severe symptoms that require hospitalization.\n\nWhat Is Preventive Care?\n\nYou can be infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) while taking care of someone with COVID-19. Although there is not yet a vaccine to prevent COVID-19, infection is preventable. The most important steps to #prevent spread are wearing a #mask, maintaining #socialdistance whenever possible, #washinghands often, and #cleaning and #sanitizing the home.\n\nFor More Information\n* \tCaring for someone sick (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC])\u2028www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/if-you-are-sick\/care-for-someone.html\n* \tClinical care guidance (CDC)\u2028www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/hcp\/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html","NumberOfLikes":26,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Dr Sandhya Ramanathan on August 17, 2020.

I do both. It is my goal to raise both my son and our dog to be loyal, disciplined, focused members of this society.

UV-C based disinfection is widely used in water and air purification.\n\nUV-C disinfection is widely seen in household as well as industrial and municipal water filters. UV-C is also used in disinfection of surfaces in bio-medical environments and has recently been used in disinfecting aeroplane cabins by Honeywell.\n\nThe same concept is being used here to disinfect groceries, mobile phone, wallets, keys, masks and any other object that can transmit microorganism and pathogens.\n\nDue to COVID-19 pandemic it has become very risky to even buy groceries and products that can get easily surface contaminated with Coronavirus. The UV Chamber is an effective way to increase the personal safety at home.\n\nThis project is very cheap and easy to build at home.

This is one slide of 5 that is a succinct snap shot of a current ideals. \n.\nI\u2019ve always been inspired by chef kinch, unfortunately from a distance, but there are just things that he\u2019s said that have stuck with me. From @chefpodcast he said \u201Cit\u2019s our job to make them better cooks than we were.\u201D That idea of passing along knowledge and encouragement is amazing. Too many chefs think it\u2019s about their egos and earning the right to put someone down. I want to treat my cooks better than I was. I want to inspire them. And when I\u2019m old and frail and out of the game, to see that they are bringing on the next generation. \n.\nIn this recent post, he also speaks of not referring to the pre-Covid times as the \u201Cgolden age\u201D but the \u201Cgilded age\u201D. There is the proof on the plate of ornate over substance, but he speaks also of business practices and labour. That ornate plate comes at a cost and that is usually on the backs of the staff or stages. \n.\nThe @thecountycanteen adapted when we opened phase 3. We switched to an as environmentally conscious disposable plating, cutlery and glass ware for the protection of the staff. Would you want to be handling a strangers fork they have slobbered on or glass with their lipstick amidst a PANDEMIC? Unfortunately one google review was not happy with these choices. Fuck them. Our food and service are still grand. Classic pre-Covid menu items are still cooked with care. So our Wollenburger comes on a tray instead of a plate. Some fucking burger, same great taste. And the new items are the bomb. We have just got our feet down and now working on more dishes. \n.\nFront of house, back of house and the public has to realize we\u2019re in a new game now. We get to decide some of the rules, outside of covid. The staff decides what behaviors will be accepted. Over the last couple years, I\u2019ve been referred to as a kitchen feminist...now Covid has turned up the volume on all my intersectional activism. And public, adapt your expectations and live in the moment. Enjoy what you get to do. Eating out on a tray is better than being on a respirator.\n.\n#wearyourmask #socialdistance #normalizemask #respectyourserver #1k1l #1kitchen1love","NumberOfLikes":18,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Robin Dutt in Picton, Ontario.

Please continue to stay safe, be considerate of others just as you would appreciate them being considerate to those closest to you, like your most vulnerable family members. I didn't anticipate sharing this as I started typing this post, but suddenly felt compelled to share with you all that I personally contracted Covid-19 over a month ago now. I found out that I was in contact with someone who wasn't taking this virus seriously, and called it a \"flu\". From first hand experience, this is not the \"flu\". It's a nasty Virus. It sucks. It beats you up hard, knocks you on your ass, and takes alot of energy, caution, self and aided care to recover.  I  can see how anyone with underlying conditions would suffer greatly with this nasty thing. I'm fortunate enough to have recovered, and never had to be hospitalized. I was down for 4 days. Most importantly to me was that my family and close friends didn't catch this thing with me. \nI get we don't want to live in fear, or feel \"controlled\", and I believe life shouldn't be lived with that fear. We have to keep living. However, I do believe we can all be just a little less selfish, and less inconsiderate of what we \"assume\" something you don't truly understand, is. Respect someone who cares enough to wear a mask, or keeps a safe social distance. They could be doing your most vulnerable friends and family a favor. The reality of the matter is this Virus will be around for a long time. So let's work together to keep the f'er in check. Stay safe people. Let's be considerate of each other.\n#covid19sucks #protectyourselves #and #those #around #you #be #courteous #live #withoutfear #but #dont #be #an #asshole #coveryourmouth #when #in #close #proximity #to #others #you #dont #live #with #or #keep #a #safeandhealthy #socialdistance Just be a good human 😏 Rant, done.

In year 22 leading up to 23 I was able to turn my Bestfriend into my boyfriend, move to a whole next state, learn more about him and his family, get our own apartment, save money, slowly but surely getting to open my own business (@noire_royal), learn how to drive not one forklift but two different types(thanks to my amazing mentor\/work mom), become a server, and now being store manager at sneaker\/clothing store, which if you know me you know I love both. All of these things have come to be from manifesting, perseverance, and overcoming my own internal struggles. I\u2019m grateful to have made it to year 23 and excited for many more years to come.
