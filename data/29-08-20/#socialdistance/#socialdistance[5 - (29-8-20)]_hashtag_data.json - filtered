But it's important we realize that most of the negative or even positive experiences we run into should not have negative long-term effects on our health.\n\nFor example, we all know a person that seemed dedicated to being healthy, but once they got in a relationship, got married or a new job everything changed. Although it's completely understandable that seemingly life-changing events could inevitably impact your health, at the most they should be a small speed bump, not a roadblock and U-turn, to being healthy.\n-\n\"Life happens\" is a saying and mindset I've adopted that basically encompasses everything bad or good could occur during my lifetime. Each of these events will affect me in some way, but ultimately it's how I choose to respond that will determine my future. So no matter if I lose my job, or my car breaks down, or I move to another state, or I start dating, or anything else that could and probably will happen, I will always try get back on track with health goals as soon as possible.

If you asked me, \u201CWhat Top 10 upside TE can I wait for late in my draft?\u201D, my answer would be Chris Herndon. \nIn 2018, he joined George Kittle, Zach Ertz, Mark Andrews, Rob Gronkowski, Hunter Henry, and Noah Fant as the only rookie TEs to average at least 8 yards per target since 2000. \nWhat did he do since his rookie year? I\u2019m glad you asked because he didn\u2019t just merely lose his job. Rather, he was injured and suspended between the last two seasons. I totally understand if you owned Herndon last year and he burned you like Usher. Believe me, I get it. Because of his stat line (1 reception for 7 yards) he\u2019s basically free for fantasy owners in 2020. People are afraid to move him up their boards, and rightly so. \nOne of the great things about fantasy (and football\/sports in general) is that it pays to have a short term memory. \nGase and company have been licking their chops at the thought of having Herndon back this year. There isn\u2019t a set pecking order for Darnold, so he can grow into their leading pass catcher as the season progresses. This was certainly the case in Herndon\u2019s rookie year. He and Darnold had and still have a great rapport on the field. \nWhat I\u2019m not saying is that Herndon should easily be your starter. Yes, he could earn his way into being that (I believe that he will), but he should be your second TE selection late , as he\u2019s going as low as the TE21 (PPR) in his ADP. Also, fantasy owners should never take the \u201CI\u2019m staying away from this entire team\u201D approach when it comes to TEs because as porous as the Jets have been, they\u2019ve trailed in many games and have been forced to air it out. What this TE class tells us is that you can stand to take a risk late if you can pull a Herndon(Jarwin, Irv. and Jonnu Smith). Gase is already all about chucking it down field. Keep your eyes peeled for Herndon LATE late. \n\n🎥: New York Jets (Youtube) \n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n#ChrisHerndon #TE2 #Jets #NY #nfl #fantasy #YourFantasyDoctor #nflmeme #SleeperoftheWeek #FantasyHelp #breakout #socialdistance #MIAMI #SamDarnold #sportsclips #Coldweatherfootball #fantasyhelp #footballtutor #mockdrafthelp #ESPNfantasy #Yahoofantasy","NumberOfLikes":90,"Hashtags":["#ChrisHerndon","#TE2","#Jets","#NY","#nfl","#fantasy","#YourFantasyDoctor","#nflmeme","#SleeperoftheWeek","#FantasyHelp","#breakout","#socialdistance","#MIAMI","#SamDarnold","#sportsclips","#Coldweatherfootball","#fantasyhelp","#footballtutor","#mockdrafthelp","#ESPNfantasy","#Yahoofantasy"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":29,"Timestamp":1597669817,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 15:10:17 CEST 2020","Location":"MetLife Stadium"},{"Owner":"vicky_jcy","CaptionText":"Greece#summer#hotdays#relax#havefun#  #socialdistance#","NumberOfLikes":6,"Hashtags":["#summe","#hotday","#rela","#havefu","#socialdistanc"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597669353,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 15:02:33 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"lavish_dolls_studio","CaptionText":"Get this \"Lavish Snatch Wrap\" to bring that waist in a couple inches for an event, to workout, for snatch maintenance... get it just because it works❗\n\nBeing snatched is a lifestyle ❗ Never forget that❤","NumberOfLikes":86,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by MD\u2019s \u201CKim K\u201D of BodySculpting in Snatched4Life.

But they were so supportive and as part of helping my growth and love for reading they gave me the VIP spot reading the bible and daily devotional at our family devotion my dad gently correcting every wrong pronunciation.

Any form of worship without God's love is useless.\u2063\n\u2063\nIf you have a romantic partner and you live with them, you would be devastated to find out that they are cheating on you or that they love somebody else.

I was overwhelmed by the people that were suffering along with me.\n\nIf you know me, you know that I attract mosquitos and as a result my poor skin shows the consequences of same. Huge red welts often turning into bruising, painful itching and swelling and a darker scar mark left behind. These bites could continue to itch for weeks. I haven't found a cream or ointment, over the counter or prescribed, that gave me much relief, if any. Until now and I'm sharing with you. 😊\n\nALL natural ingredients - butters and essential oils - mixed together and put in a biodegradable push up tube. No plastics to worry about when done! \n\nI'm happy to share that these tubes will be available NEXT WEEKEND.

I can pick up on what needs to be healed, and speak healing or provide reframing to that aspect. I have familiarized myself with my own darkness and unconsciousness, and have deep enough compassion to hold the hand of another and walk with them through their own darkness, feeling the depth of that pain with a person, so they don\u2019t feel alone in it. I can feel both my unconditional and limitless well of love and compassion, as well as my temporal and physical limitations during this experience. And, truly, my willingness to be THIS open and vulnerable to the depth and fullness of life, whether good or bad, has granted me access to the juiciest, deepest, most delicious parts of life. I have accessed levels of feeling that most people dare not allow.

This is life with a parent in an assisted living facility. This is me, standing 10+ feet behind him just to get a pic. This is not fair. And even tho I\u2019m smiling for him, this is not fun. \n\nBackstory: My daddy had a severe, hemorrhagic stroke 6 years ago (Aug 22, 2014) just one month shy of turning 70. He was active, healthy, living his best retired life doing what he loved best: building things. He was a \u201Cfixer-upper\u201D before it was a thing. 😉 \n\nHe should not have survived. But he did. \n\nHe should not be able to remember things. But he does. \n\nHe should not be able to speak. But he does.\n\nMy sweet mama took him home after 7 weeks in the hospital and vowed to take care of him, help him heal, and be there for as long as it took - no matter what. That\u2019s what you do when you\u2019ve loved a person since you were 14! When you\u2019ve been married since you were 19! When you\u2019ve been married for 50+ years. But after 3.5 years, and multiple moves, it was evident she could not hold out long term.\n\nEnter Assisted Living. We are a family familiar with assisted living via the development\/business side. Such a BLESSING! He is well taken care of, and he is content! Thank you Jesus! But...we have not entered the building or been in close contact with him since mid March!! FIVE months without a hug, a handshake, a high five, a kiss on the cheek, a snuggle, or a conversation in close proximity. We understand the need to protect the vulnerable, all those in these homes. We do! But let me just say it was HARD not to run over and hug my daddy\u2019s neck! And bless my sweet mama....Covid is not easy on married couples in this situation. If you are the praying kind - remember the couples who are in this situation. Not all assisted living or nursing home residents are just old and ready to \u201Cgo home\u201D. Some are still married and miss their spouse\u2019s visits, touch, and closeness.\n\nThis is covid. And there seems to be no end to it.

Não é tão simples deixar os sonhos descansando e deixar na memória os abraços calorosos. \nCovid-19 nos mostrou a dificuldade em ficar longe, em ter que se distanciar, precisar colocar um pouco de lado o carinho, manter o rosto coberto e proteger as mãos em frações de segundos. \nEu me desesperei e enfraqueci em muitos momentos, eu deixei de lado a segurança em vários deles e provavelmente coloquei em risco a segurança de alguém e, até mesmo a minha. Eu fui hipócrita quando reclamei de forma egoísta que o país que eu escolhi morar decidiu fazer o lockdown. Eu me responsabilizo pela falha, mas hoje eu entendi que foi por um bem maior e pela segurança da maioria. Voltando tudo mais ou menos ao normal, eu só queria poder exercitar mais a minha humanidade e entender que ser humilde também é uma questão de confiar naqueles que sabem mais, naqueles que possuem mais e melhores informações, naqueles que estudaram e são mais capacitados para escolherem por mim, quando eu mesma não tinha maturidade pra fazer essa escolha. \nHoje eu sou grata, grata por ter escolhido esse país, que me deu dignidade pra continuar em casa, que me deu oportunidade de estar segura, que cuidou de mim e de outras pessoas que também não tinham maturidade pra escolher. Estou grata pelos números de mortes não terem sido tão altos, mas pela quantidade de sobreviventes e curados terem ultrapassado os dados da tristeza. \nUma vida perdida é uma vida perdida.
