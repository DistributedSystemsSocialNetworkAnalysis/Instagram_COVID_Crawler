But also! \u2063\n\u2063\n🍊 Outside time, as much as possible ☀️ Sun exposure feeds our need for that good ol\u2019 Vitamin D 🌞 Fresh air and water also do wonders for our immunity 💦🌬\u2063\n\u2063\n🍊 Good bacteria are def a thing. A really important thing! Completely vital to our immune systems. Don\u2019t become afraid of your own microbiome! Getting your hands in the dirt is actually really healthy. Yes - even right now 🌱\u2063\n\u2063\n🍊 Less news! 📖 Worrying constantly keeps anxiety and cortisol levels high. Putting your body in \u2018fight or flight\u2019 prematurely means your body has less energy to spare if a real threat happens to come along ⚡️\u2063\n\u2063\n🍊 Stress eating🍴is completely VALID, BUT could negatively affect your health. Over-eating rule of thumb 👍 - our body puts energy towards either healing or digesting. Which is the priority rn? & Also, eating out \/ quick meals often lead to consuming more inflammatory & processed foods which could throw off our gut balance, and our guts are the key to regulating our immune systems. Best things you can eat right now? More prebiotics! More probiotics! More ferments! 🍌🍲\u2063\n\u2063\n🍊 Stress drinking 🍷 is completely VALID, but similarly, can lower our immune systems when relied on in excess. Same with pharmaceuticals, same with smoking - all dependent on quality & frequency. May I gently suggest cannabis edibles, teas, or tinctures instead? 🌿\u2063\n\u2063\n🍊 Movement medicine 🏃\u200D♀️🏃\u200D♂️ Yoga, weights, or perhaps a walk around the block? Get that blood flowin\u2019 and that oxygen circulatin\u2019 to regenerate and revitalize all your cells 🧬✨\u2063\n\u2063\n🍊 Kindness & self compassion! Many suggestions on this list are only available to those with privilege, access, and willpower \/ energy. 💪 If you can\u2019t or don\u2019t choose to follow any of this advice, kindness towards yourself and total acceptance of exactly where you\u2019re at reduces stress and minimizes the internal struggle to always \u2018improve\u2019 📈. Loving yourself as-is fully, with compassion, actually boosts immunity quite a bit! Reality is such a whirlwind right now. 🌪 You\u2019re doing great!

Catch us virtually at 11:30am Saturday and Sunday. For our new students, Hot Pilates is a full-body high-intensity, low-impact workout that burns calories in half of the time of traditional endurance training (aka treadmill). HIIT is a cardio session arranged as short bursts of challenging work. The whole point of high-intensity training is to kick up the intensity of your cardio. In order to qualify as true HIIT, you'll need to push yourself to the max (no matter if you\u2019re a beginner or conditioned) during every set. That's why they're short\u201420 seconds of work, 10 seconds of rest. This class is designed for beginners all the way to the most conditioned students. This training compliments the bikram yoga because it makes you stronger for the postures. It never gets easier, you just get stronger!⠀\n🔸⠀\n🔸⠀\n🔸⠀\n#hotyoga #hotyogahouston #theoriginal #acceptnosubstitutes #ihp #infernohotpilates #socialdistance #virtualconnection #letsstaytogether","NumberOfLikes":22,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Hot Yoga Houston on August 15, 2020.

I'm Dr. Hina Talib, teen doc and toddler mom. Everyone is talking about mental health concerns in teens & YA's. A top worry is for the lonely teen.\u2009\n\u2009\n😌I'm hearing this from teens who have been isolated due to stay-at-home orders & also, looking forward, to the fall with school non-re-opening about. Even schools\u2009\nthat will open virtually or distanced, students have asked me how they will be able to connect to peers. \u2009\n\u2009\n😳Also, many teens were lonely before the pandemic! Loneliness can look different in different kids, & you may not know unless you ask (even a kid who is social or extroverted may feel lonely). Only way to know is through communication & active listening. \u2009\n\u2009\n👩🏻\u200D⚕️I hope these tips help:\u2009\n\u2009\n✔️A feeling of connection can come through organizing with others for a common goal, help find a cause that speaks to them, or it can be a family activity. \u2009\n\u2009\n✔️In early pandemic survey studies, time spent with family was a strong protective factor against depression\/anxiety for teens. Be present with them. \u2009\n\u2009\n✔️Consider podding with 1-2 families of close & like minded (regards to safety) peers for your teen.  Can think of this as a mental health pod for your kid. This can be done for those attending & zooming into school. For some, this might mean a little more distance from grandparents, for a time. Safety, trust & communication \u2009\n\u2009\n✔️Physical touch helps. Snuggle that kid, have kids snuggle their sibs\/pets. \u2009\n\u2009\n✔️Teachers are such pros. Lean into them & their ideas to help increase connections in the \"classrooms\"\u2009\n\u2009\n✔️If things feel out of balance remember, therapy is available, can ask Pediatrician & schools what their counseling plans are. A tele-health group of problem-solving lonely teens sound awesome to me. \u2009\n\u2009\n✔️Feeling left out when peers are not distancing is tough one. Running out of room, will answer in stories!\u2009\n\u2009\nDrop a ❤️ if this was helpful & pls tag friend below. What has helped your tween, teen and YAs feel less lonely? I asked this in a question box, will share your helpful responses to my stories too, later today.

The monument is 24.65 m high, 25 m wide, and 5 m deep. The arch itself is 15.35 m high in the center and 8 m across.\nThe main arch is flanked by obelisks applied to the wall face bearing sculptural groups of trophies of arms. Above the main arch, the southern face carries a sculptural group by Michel Anguier of \"The Passage of the Rhine\" in a sunk panel, while the north face carries allegorical figures of the Rhine and the Netherlands. The entablature bears the gilded bronze inscription LUDOVICO MAGNO, \"To Louis the Great\".\n\n🐥🔪About Tour Saint-Jacques:\n\n\"The Tour Saint-Jacques (Saint James's Tower') is a monument located in the 4th arrondissement of Paris, France, at the intersection of Rue de Rivoli with Rue Nicolas Flamel.

Sel-sel ini bertanggung jawab untuk menjaga tubuh kita bekerja setiap harinya, seperti membuat jantung kita berdetak, otak kita berpikir, ginjal membersihkan darah kita, mengganti kulit yang terkelupas, dan seterusnya. Tugas khusus dari stem cell adalah untuk menciptakan berbagai jenis sel tersebut. Stem cell adalah sumber untuk sel-sel baru. Pada saat stem cell membelah, mereka dapat memperbanyak diri sendiri atau menjadi jenis sel yang lain. Contohnya, stem cell di kulit dapat menciptakan lebih banyak stem cell kulit atau mereka dapat membuat sel kulit terdiferensiasi yang memiliki tugas spesifik seperti membuat pigmen melanin.\n\nKenapa Stemcell penting untuk kita?\n\nSaat kita terluka atau sakit, sel kita juga terluka atau mati. Saat hal ini terjadi, stem cell menjadi aktif. Stem cell memiliki tugas untuk memperbaiki jaringan yang terluka atau menggantikan sel lain pada saat mereka mengalami kematian rutin. Dengan cara ini, stem cell kita menjaga kita tetap sehat dan mencegah kita dari penuaan dini. Stem cell bertindak seperti pasukan dokter mikroskopis milik kita sendiri.\n\nSumber : ipscell.com\n.\n.\n#afclifescience #afcjapan #kesehatan #sop100 #sop100plus #salmon #salmonovarypeptide #utsukushhii #antitumor #kanker #jantung #stroke #ginjal #gagalginjal #diabetes #asma #tumor #antiaging #autoimun #healthsupplement #healthsupplements #corona #coronavirus #virus #stemcell #cell #socialdistancing #socialdistance #stayhome #stayhealthy","NumberOfLikes":5,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by AFC Steam Cell Therapy in Kota Malang.

If one of the kids went into the gate of the pasture and the other walked along the outside instead, we'd end up trapped on one side or the other. We were just a few feet apart, but still not quite together. The barbs were a small, but effective way to separate us. These days of weathering through a pandemic with a world of social distancing, we can often find ourselves a bit apart from one another, like bunnies on different sides of a barbed wire fence. And though, I may not have the urge to touch noses like bunnies might, hugs are still something that I miss most of all these days. I would have never thought that six feet of distance would feel like a mile, but I now realize that it can. This too shall pass one day, though, and we can thankfully connect in so many virtual ways. But, I'll still holding my highest hopes for a future full of hugs\u2026 (full story on doodlewash.com!). \n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n#WorldWatercolorGroup #doodlewash #watercolor #watercolour #artoftheweek #artistjournal #artjournaling #bunnyrabbits #bunnyrabbit #watercolorillustrator #watercolorillustration #watercolourillustration #watercolourart #watercolourartist #watercolorsketch #bunnydrawing #rabbitillustration #bunnypainting #artchallenge #illustrationart #watercolordrawing #rabbitdrawing #rabbitpainting #bunnyillustration #storybookillustration #socialdistancingmemes #animalillustrations #socialdistance","NumberOfLikes":869,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":56,"Timestamp":1597358090,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 14 00:34:50 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#friends #socialdistance #lafamiliaqueeliges","NumberOfLikes":32,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Fernando Camba in Vigo, Spain with @gutesgeschmack_gerardo, @bertojch, and @mario_alru.

The results in my confidence levels are incomparable.\n\n1️\u20E3 The 1st picture was taken in January, 2020. I was off the beer with 2 weeks and only beginning my latest journey. I was pretty miserable at this time and trying my hardest to drag myself out of the hole I'd found myself in. Getting to the gym alone was a major accomishment. \n\nI always remember how I felt on that day. I was so anxious. My confidence levels were at rock bottom and I was so paranoid that everyone was judging me. I was very uncomfortable the whole time. But, I always remeber thinking, 'I'm never going to feel this way again'. It was like ⛽ to the 🔥. From that moment, I knew I'd have to work my ass off to get into shape.\n\n2️\u20E3 This photo was taken 8 months later. Last Friday, August 14th to be exact. It was the first time I'd been into a gym in 6 months and I've not lifed a weight within that time frame. Pure cadio, alcohol free and inprovements on my diet was the magic formula. \n\nI felt so confident. I felt like a bad ass. I felt proud. I felt a level of accomplisment. The transformation had really occurred and I'd surpassed all my goals.\n\nEveryone has to start somewhere. Everyone's weight loss and health journey begins with a decision. A decision to change. The next thing is to take action and go workout. Get your body active. By getting active alone, you'll notice huge differences in your mental health. And then, work hard. Stay consistent and trust in the process. Hard work will yield results.","NumberOfLikes":106,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Shane Goggin - Laoch in London, United Kingdom.

I\u2019ve seen many moms talking about how difficult distance learning is, all the extra work & having to teach everything themselves, is hard. Everyone wants schools to open because its important. But the matter of fact is- it isn\u2019t going to be back to normal for a while. So the best we can do, is to let the reality set in. Focus on your next step. I have been handling this much better than I expected. And I\u2019m doing so because I\u2019ve decided not to let the stress get to me. Schooling is important, but there\u2019s also a lot that goes along with that. Mental & physical health, especially. Making sure your kids are physically active, that they get enough rest, enough social interaction & are mentally healthy is SO important. So many parents are putting a lot more pressure on their kids-and it\u2019s already hard enough. Distanced learning is going to be hard & I feel the best way to make sure your kids are going to succeed is by making sure your kids are happy and healthy. This is a difficult time for them too, and they are just kids! So many will fall behind in school because of the stress. That\u2019s just how it is right now. What\u2019s important is Mental & physical health, Social interaction (mental health) Get these kids to FaceTime with friends after school. Make it a priority. & Set a realistic schedule. It might take a week or two to get the hang of your schedule especially if you have more than one kid at home. Make sure your kids are retaining the information that they are learning. Because that\u2019s all that REALLY matters. Get the assignments done the best you can. But as long as you are keeping your kids mentally happy...learning & retaining the information WILL come easier than if they feel this huge amount of stress. What matters is that they are LEARNING. Families are losing their jobs, losing homes, losing family members. School districts know this. All you can do is the best that YOU can do. & remember to take care of yourself as well. Go on a walk every night, get some \u201Cme\u201D time. Being happy, is SO important. Don\u2019t stress. Just do the best you can. That is all.

It is fertile ground; the place where children strengthen social bonds, build emotional maturity, develop cognitive skills, and shore up their physical health. 💚⠀\n⠀\nKids know intuitively that play time is essential. Many teachers and parents also understand that it\u2019s crucial for a child\u2019s proper development. And increasingly, science is supporting this argument.⠀\nFor example, The Atlantic article refers to studies stating that free unstructured play helps children develop self-regulation skills, which helps them calm themselves and focus in class.⠀\nWe know that both structured activities and free play are essential for kids\u2019 proper development. But times have changed and for so many of us, with both parents working, there is often no other option but to program children with camps and activities during the summer. So how can we make sure that our kids get their unstructured time? 🌻⠀\n⠀\nHere are some suggestions:⠀\nMake frequent trips to the playground and let your kids take risks⠀\nVisit farms, forests, and ravines where kids can explore nature⠀\nBecome a play angel so your kids will have a safe environment for kid-led play⠀\nChoose a camp that values free play and discovery time for kids⠀\nStart a Parent Club with a group of friends⠀\nMake sure evenings and weekends include lots of downtime.⠀\nThough challenging, it\u2019s definitely not impossible to give kids the freedom they need during their break from the school year. How do you make sure your kids have time for free play?⠀\n⠀\nhttps:\/\/buff.ly\/33ybDGV","NumberOfLikes":19,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Champions for Life Foundation on August 13, 2020.
