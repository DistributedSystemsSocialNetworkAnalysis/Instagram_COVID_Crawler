Sel-sel ini bertanggung jawab untuk menjaga tubuh kita bekerja setiap harinya, seperti membuat jantung kita berdetak, otak kita berpikir, ginjal membersihkan darah kita, mengganti kulit yang terkelupas, dan seterusnya. Tugas khusus dari stem cell adalah untuk menciptakan berbagai jenis sel tersebut. Stem cell adalah sumber untuk sel-sel baru. Pada saat stem cell membelah, mereka dapat memperbanyak diri sendiri atau menjadi jenis sel yang lain. Contohnya, stem cell di kulit dapat menciptakan lebih banyak stem cell kulit atau mereka dapat membuat sel kulit terdiferensiasi yang memiliki tugas spesifik seperti membuat pigmen melanin.\n\nKenapa Stemcell penting untuk kita?\n\nSaat kita terluka atau sakit, sel kita juga terluka atau mati. Saat hal ini terjadi, stem cell menjadi aktif. Stem cell memiliki tugas untuk memperbaiki jaringan yang terluka atau menggantikan sel lain pada saat mereka mengalami kematian rutin. Dengan cara ini, stem cell kita menjaga kita tetap sehat dan mencegah kita dari penuaan dini. Stem cell bertindak seperti pasukan dokter mikroskopis milik kita sendiri.\n\nSumber : ipscell.com\n.\n.\n#afclifescience #afcjapan #kesehatan #sop100 #sop100plus #salmon #salmonovarypeptide #utsukushhii #antitumor #kanker #jantung #stroke #ginjal #gagalginjal #diabetes #asma #tumor #antiaging #autoimun #healthsupplement #healthsupplements #corona #coronavirus #virus #stemcell #cell #socialdistancing #socialdistance #stayhome #stayhealthy","NumberOfLikes":5,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by AFC Steam Cell Therapy in Kota Malang.

If one of the kids went into the gate of the pasture and the other walked along the outside instead, we'd end up trapped on one side or the other. We were just a few feet apart, but still not quite together. The barbs were a small, but effective way to separate us. These days of weathering through a pandemic with a world of social distancing, we can often find ourselves a bit apart from one another, like bunnies on different sides of a barbed wire fence. And though, I may not have the urge to touch noses like bunnies might, hugs are still something that I miss most of all these days. I would have never thought that six feet of distance would feel like a mile, but I now realize that it can. This too shall pass one day, though, and we can thankfully connect in so many virtual ways. But, I'll still holding my highest hopes for a future full of hugs\u2026 (full story on doodlewash.com!). \n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n#WorldWatercolorGroup #doodlewash #watercolor #watercolour #artoftheweek #artistjournal #artjournaling #bunnyrabbits #bunnyrabbit #watercolorillustrator #watercolorillustration #watercolourillustration #watercolourart #watercolourartist #watercolorsketch #bunnydrawing #rabbitillustration #bunnypainting #artchallenge #illustrationart #watercolordrawing #rabbitdrawing #rabbitpainting #bunnyillustration #storybookillustration #socialdistancingmemes #animalillustrations #socialdistance","NumberOfLikes":868,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":56,"Timestamp":1597358090,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 14 00:34:50 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#friends #socialdistance #lafamiliaqueeliges","NumberOfLikes":32,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Fernando Camba in Vigo, Spain with @gutesgeschmack_gerardo, @bertojch, and @mario_alru.

Plus, even though we are indoors - the entire Beer Spa experience is socially distanced!\u2060\n\u2060\nFrom contactless check-in to a sanitized, self-serve beer wall, we have thought of your safety every step of the way. The seats in our taproom are spaced 6-feet apart, and since you self-serve your drinks, you don't have to worry about interacting with a server. 🍻\u2060\n\u2060\nEven better, our Beer Therapy Rooms are completely private and disinfected after each use! During your 60-minute Beer Therapy Room session, you have an entire room to yourself where you can jump between the included beer bath, infrared sauna, relaxation deck, and rain shower. 🛀🏽\u2060\n\u2060\nWe leave 30 minutes in between each Beer Therapy Room booking, which gives us time to drain, clean, and refill the tubs, as well as disinfect all floors and surfaces. \u2060\n\u2060\nReady to try a unique socially-distanced spa experience?

It is fertile ground; the place where children strengthen social bonds, build emotional maturity, develop cognitive skills, and shore up their physical health. 💚⠀\n⠀\nKids know intuitively that play time is essential. Many teachers and parents also understand that it\u2019s crucial for a child\u2019s proper development. And increasingly, science is supporting this argument.⠀\nFor example, The Atlantic article refers to studies stating that free unstructured play helps children develop self-regulation skills, which helps them calm themselves and focus in class.⠀\nWe know that both structured activities and free play are essential for kids\u2019 proper development. But times have changed and for so many of us, with both parents working, there is often no other option but to program children with camps and activities during the summer. So how can we make sure that our kids get their unstructured time? 🌻⠀\n⠀\nHere are some suggestions:⠀\nMake frequent trips to the playground and let your kids take risks⠀\nVisit farms, forests, and ravines where kids can explore nature⠀\nBecome a play angel so your kids will have a safe environment for kid-led play⠀\nChoose a camp that values free play and discovery time for kids⠀\nStart a Parent Club with a group of friends⠀\nMake sure evenings and weekends include lots of downtime.⠀\nThough challenging, it\u2019s definitely not impossible to give kids the freedom they need during their break from the school year. How do you make sure your kids have time for free play?⠀\n⠀\nhttps:\/\/buff.ly\/33ybDGV","NumberOfLikes":19,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Champions for Life Foundation on August 13, 2020.

I missed visiting relatives and even just picnic-ing by the river with family. We had to adjust our routines and make mask wearing a norm.\n\nI started sewing to entertain my mind, and teaching my six children. This was hard as I don't have the skills of a high school or primary school teacher. My 8 month old baby crawling around sure keeps me on my toes!

Setelah suapan pertama, we instantly love this Maple Pecan Basque Cheesecake & Salted Caramel New York Cheesecake!! Yes, sesuka itu lho karena kita maunya makan cheesecake yang bikinnya gak terlalu cheesy, supaya gak eneq. Jangan kaget kalau bagian atasnya terlihat gelap seperti ini ya, karena it's caramelized dan sudah jadi khasnya Basque Cheesecake gitu. And guess what? The inside is surprisingly smooth, creamy, and delicious! \n\nTaste cheese-nya pun lighter than cheesecake yang umum di pasaran, tanpa sadar I found myself eating several slices wkwkwkw... 'Coz it's so gooooood! 🤤 Seriusan deh, harus pake banget cobain.... apalagi pas makannya dikasi siraman Maple Syrup dan ada sensasi crunchy dari candied pecans di atasnya! Pssst, NY Cheesecake-nya juga enaaaak banget lho; tinggal disiremin pakai salted caramel sauce-nya aja & trust me, one slice is not enough! ❤️Best for all occasions nih; sweet surprises buat #cheesecake lovers, birthday, acara-acara, etc... \n\n#myfunfoodiary\n\n#cheesecake #infokuliner #kulinerpluit #sweetcuisines #contentcreators #eatguide #smartfoodchoice #foodjourney #laperbaper #tastesogood #jktfoodies\u2060 #chocolover #jktfood #forahappymoment #stayathome #wfh #eeeeeats #starvingtime #onthetableproject #beautifulcuisines #milkteatime #foodie #makanapa #socialdistance","NumberOfLikes":1090,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Gorge Bakehouse on August 13, 2020.

Why? When someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain viruses. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets or even virus if the person has the disease.''\n\nWith Keepa, when kids are not at a safe social distance in public🚎, they'll receive warnings from their Keepa. This will help kids make a habit of keeping a safe social distance. Keepa is integrated with 3 alert modes and comes with a wrist strap and lanyard for ease of use. kids can switch different alert modes and decide how to wear it as they like, making it more like a cute toy watch that is appealing to kids than a common alarm⏰. \n\n📋Learn more: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2DNluy6\n.\n.\n.\n.\n. \n#covidsafe #backtoschool #backtoschool2020 #schoolbegins #handwashing #socialdistance #socialdistancing","NumberOfLikes":8,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by TinkerGen | STEM Education on August 13, 2020.
