Why? When someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain viruses. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets or even virus if the person has the disease.''\n\nWith Keepa, when kids are not at a safe social distance in public🚎, they'll receive warnings from their Keepa. This will help kids make a habit of keeping a safe social distance. Keepa is integrated with 3 alert modes and comes with a wrist strap and lanyard for ease of use. kids can switch different alert modes and decide how to wear it as they like, making it more like a cute toy watch that is appealing to kids than a common alarm⏰. \n\n📋Learn more: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2DNluy6\n.\n.\n.\n.\n. \n#covidsafe #backtoschool #backtoschool2020 #schoolbegins #handwashing #socialdistance #socialdistancing","NumberOfLikes":8,"Hashtags":["#covidsafe","#backtoschool","#backtoschool2020","#schoolbegins","#handwashing","#socialdistance","#socialdistancing"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by TinkerGen | STEM Education on August 13, 2020.

Pack outfits that mix and match and basics. \n\n👟🥿Find the perfect balance between weight, style, and comfort. If you are planning to walk long distances is not a good idea to pack only sandals. You need to feel comfortable and ready to enjoy your adventure. Choose multi-use shoes. Do not pack one pair per night. \n\n👝Buy a small travel bag and small bottles to put your shampoo, creams, and soap. This is the perfect time to use those samples you have in your bathroom and have never used.\n \n🔌Do not forget your electronics and chargers. \n\n🤩Now you have packed only what you need and have a lot of additional space.

Landscape photography that transports you to the heart of Italy. While of course you'll find this levity in the studio, we'd be amiss if there wasn't some variety in store. By special request, we displayed the caves from Spain right in the studio! From black and white to colorized, these photos could make you hear the low winds and the dripping drops of the cave. Sounds that let you know this cave has withstood the tides of time and makes you wonder what stories it must keeps. LaDonnaFoto has a vast collection in the studio, and the pieces in the studio are always changing, and no two weeks are the same. Now with the addition of the screen, and the ability to make custom requests to LaDonnaFoto, the studio can be almost anything you want it to be! We are of course still practicing #socialdistance at @sawyeryards as safety and health is a number one priority, and while you may not be able to fly to see the depths of the caves in Spain, you can come to the studio and get your own personal cave tour on screen. \n\n#PalmadeMallorca #Spain #DrachCaves #DrachCavesinSpain #Houston #HoustonArtist","NumberOfLikes":9,"Hashtags":["#socialdistance","#PalmadeMallorca","#Spain","#DrachCaves","#DrachCavesinSpain","#Houston","#HoustonArtist"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597275166,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 13 01:32:46 CEST 2020","Location":"Cuevas del Drach"},{"Owner":"theestylistb","CaptionText":"About this weekend!! #bts #setlife @miccheckwithstylistb #season3 #socialdistance Edition #grateful \n\nW\/ @boy.matrix @toxicthedirector & @lnphaircare @larussiapeters","NumberOfLikes":49,"Hashtags":["#bts","#setlife","#season3","#socialdistance","#grateful"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1597274136,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 13 01:15:36 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"nmt_asap","CaptionText":"Remember to wash your hands and wear your mask as we approach the fall semester! #NMTASAP #SocialDistance","NumberOfLikes":4,"Hashtags":["#NMTASAP","#SocialDistance"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by NMT_ASAP on August 12, 2020.

Spread happens when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, and droplets from their mouth or nose are launched into the air and land in the mouths or noses of people nearby. The droplets can also be inhaled into the lungs. Recent studies indicate that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19. Since people can spread the virus before they know they are sick, it is important to stay at least 6 feet away from others when possible, even if you\u2014or they\u2014do not have any symptoms. Social distancing is especially important for people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.\n\n#socialdistance #covid19 #stayhealthyketchikan #stepsforahealthycommunity","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#socialdistance","#covid19","#stayhealthyketchikan","#stepsforahealthycommunity"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Ketchikan Gateway Borough on August 12, 2020.

It also helps pets sleep deeper which is SUPER helpful when staying in hotel rooms or anywhere out of place.

I did a listing presentation for a potential client and, out of curiosity, I looked up the past selling prices for the same property.  In 1998, her home sold for $116K.  In 2014, she purchased the property for $172K.  If she were to list the home today, the probable selling price would be approximately $235K.  That\u2019s a $63,000 jump in price in just 6 years FOR THE SAME HOUSE!!!

When I posted I\u2019m adopting 2 families in Tampa. My inbox was flooded with people that wanted to help. A few non profits reached out to me about a partnership and I received donations via cashapp from those who supported the cause. Every cashapp I received match my donation amount. \n\nNeedless to say in addition to the two families I adopted, 3 additional families were adopted as well. A total of 500.00 was given towards groceries for 5 families!\n\nWe are in a time where people need real help. Our government isn\u2019t helping so we have to pull together. Food banks are seeing a record high of people in need. If you are blessed to help someone in need I encourage you to do so. \n\nWe are in this together. As a community we need to band together. Congress\/senate is having a hard time helping the people. It\u2019s time for us to stand up and help each other. \n\nI\u2019m working on way to extend this act of kindness nationwide. In addition, my next step is to adopt a school. I want to pay fo the lunches of those kids who parents opt for their child to stay home and do online learning. Somehow the school board thought it was cool to withhold lunch for students who will be doing online learning instead of physically coming into school. This is sad and uncalled for! I feel like they are targeting a certain group (just my opinion). I feel like they have no empathy for what\u2019s going on and only care about the funding that will be cut if kids are not seated in a classroom. \n\nMy question is, if you can give away millions of lunches for free at the beginning of the pandemic, why withhold lunch to those who will be continuing online learning 😡\n\nIt\u2019s time to get to work and help our people because THEY aren\u2019t willing to do so✊🏽","NumberOfLikes":90,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Sarina in United States.

For one I am elated that they are heading back for in classroom learning, I sucked at being a teacher, mom, housekeeper, personal assistant, chauffeur, entertainer, short order cook, master disciplinarian, entrepreneur and business owner all at one time. I am overjoyed that we chose a school here in Florida (thank you @stmarkslionspbg ) that cares about our children\u2019s education and mental state and has taken the initiative to put into practice measurements to safely reopen. I am scared that at any moment the privilege of being in school could change beyond my control and that maybe it was selfish of me to send them off in the first place. I HATE that they have to wear masks! Today feels like 105 degrees and I was hot just taking this picture at 7:30am. I\u2019m heartbroken that Reed was so excited to pack a football for recess and I didn\u2019t have the guts to tell him football is not an approved activity in the new normal. Im worried that Lily\u2019s new backpack is too heavy from all the water bottles I had to pack because refilling at the school\u2019s water fountain has been deemed a \u201Cthreat\u201D and is unsafe according to the CDC.\n.\n.\n.\nI am sad, sad that our friends near and far are still uncertain about what their own back to school experience will look like. Angry that for so many there are no viable realistic options for their children so that they can return to their regularly scheduled programing whatever it may be (👩🏻\u200D🎓🧑\u200D🔧🧑🏽\u200D🔬🦹🏻💅🧖🏻\u200D♀️🎾🧘💃).

Here's my take. \n#WAP is an opportunity to:\n1) Celebrate the creativity of Black women - yes, I realize that black women may not have been the only folks involved in writing the verses, laying down the beats, creating the video concepts, etc. Regardless, the metaphors and lyrical creativity were on point.\n2) Celebrate the beauty of Black (female) bodies - Cardi b and Meg showed up in their full thyckness for the video.🍑\n3) Celebrate Black (female) collaboration - the collaboration included not only Cardi b and Meg Thee Stallion, but also @KylieJenner @normani @sukihanagoat @therubirose @rosalia.vt @mulatto. Support Black artists, support Black creators, support Black women...PERIODT.\n4) Celebrate Black sexuality - the sexuality of Black women is always being policed, from politicians to physicians to pimps. During this video 1 take on female sexuality is on full display! Does it describe the sexuality of EVERY Black woman? Of course not. But it does describe some Black women, and some women in general. \n*\nSo if WAP isn't for you, then don't partake, but keep your judgments to yourself 🤷🏾\u200D♀️ and allow other folks to celebrate all the grandeur of WAP. \n* \nAgree or Disagree 🤔? ⬇️ Share your thoughts.\n*\n*\n#NewDayPsycCoach #blackpsychologist #LifeCoachdfw #speaker #affirmations #identity #podcast #RelationshipGoals #RelationshipCoach #femalesexuality #hiphop #LoveYourself #BlackBusinesses #BoyMom #family #NaturalHair #YouOkSis #MentalIllness #GreekLife #BlackCulture #dfw #INTJ #college #empowered #socialdistance #wearamask\n#LinkInBio","NumberOfLikes":34,"Hashtags":["#WAP","#WAP","#NewDayPsycCoach","#blackpsychologist","#LifeCoachdfw","#speaker","#affirmations","#identity","#podcast","#RelationshipGoals","#RelationshipCoach","#femalesexuality","#hiphop","#LoveYourself","#BlackBusinesses","#BoyMom","#family","#NaturalHair","#YouOkSis","#MentalIllness","#GreekLife","#BlackCulture","#dfw","#INTJ","#college","#empowered","#socialdistance","#wearamask","#LinkInBio"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Dr 'T' - Affirmation Coach in Arlington, Texas.

This isolation is far from being the most difficult thing I\u2019ve ever gone through in my life personally, but it\u2019s so easy to get caught up in the frustrations and inconveniences of change and being pushed out of the normalcy of what we are so accustomed to. There are definitely ebbs and flows and days that are harder than others, especially for those of us who are doing quarantine alone. But the reminder of all the little blessings, how much health is wealth right now, just trusting in God, being grateful for what I have and staying the course, one day at a time, truly gets me through. This isn\u2019t just about ourselves, and our own personal comfort, it\u2019s about all of us together and most importantly, health. Start caring.

We cooked our food items at home the day before we left:\n\nSteamed rice and quinoa, stewed yellow squash & onions, crumbled seasoned tofu, roasted asparagus, bok choy, mushrooms, and a mix of snow peas, onions and mushrooms. \n\nWe packaged each food item separately in zip lock bags; and loaded into our cooler  we also packed fresh green onions & cilantro.\n\nAbout 2 hours to our destination, we pulled over and put the squash and onions into one pyrex and the mix of snow peas, mushrooms and onions into the other along with some of the bok choy.... plugged it into the inverter and lunch was nice and ready when we got to the campground.\n\nOur other hot meals (we ate fruit & chia pudding for breakfast... and had chickpea salad and hummus as other meal options) were grain bowls using the prepared veggies:\n\nUsing each pyrex as a bowl, place the grain in bottom of pyrex, the quinoa seemed fine as is, but I recommend adding just a splash of water to the rice, then the tofu and other ingredients, plug in for 2 hrs or so.\n\nWhen done, add chopped green onions, cilantro, seeds, nuts, and condiments (we like Maggi, sesame oil, & Laoganmao).\n\nWe were very pleased with our first trip using the Hot Logic!\n\n#myhotlogic \n\n#veggieheavykitchen #vegan\n#vegansofinstagram #vegansofig \n#veganfoodshare \n#veganfoodisgoodfood \n#veganhomecooking\n\n#plantbased #plantbaseddiet\n\n#wanderingsouthernvegan\n#stlouis #stlouisvegan \n\n #washyourhands \n#socialdistance #wearamask\n#coronavirus #pandemic\n#covid19 \n\n#rvlife #rv #socialdistancetravel\n\n#loveyourneighbor\n#seekjustice","NumberOfLikes":13,"Hashtags":["#myhotlogic","#veggieheavykitchen","#vegan","#vegansofinstagram","#vegansofig","#veganfoodshare","#veganfoodisgoodfood","#veganhomecooking","#plantbased","#plantbaseddiet","#wanderingsouthernvegan","#stlouis","#stlouisvegan","#washyourhands","#socialdistance","#wearamask","#coronavirus","#pandemic","#covid19","#rvlife","#rv","#socialdistancetravel","#loveyourneighbor","#seekjustice"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Veggie Heavy Kitchen in Meremac Springs.

Not only was that an amazing act during incredibly hard times but their food, their good vibes and positive customer service keep me coming back. I get the Ono Chicken with Rice and Mac. And Carl gets the Kalua pig, not pictured. This time he tried the Poke which was so fresh and flavorful. Almost stole his dinner to eat myself! Their portions are huge for the price (easily two meals) and quality. Also what\u2019s cool is that they rotate their menu all the time so theres a ton of new food to try!
