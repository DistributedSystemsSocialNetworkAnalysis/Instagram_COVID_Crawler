We have already been able to help 1 person do this and I can't wait to be able to help more. Kindness is a passport that opens doors and fashions friends it softens hearts and molds relationships. That can last lifetimes. I am just no starting to realize the true impacts of kindness and just how much it can change a person's life. All it takes is one kind word, wearing a mask ( yes it is done out of kindness and respect for others )or even just a smile can change the course of someone's day. Be the change you want to see in the world. Have a beautiful weekend!\n#weddingweekend #thankyou #payitforward #staytuned #weddingservice #weddings #elopement #servicespecials #bethechangeyouwanttoseeintheworld #bekind #endracism #thankful #thankfulandblessed #blessedwiththebest #lovemyjob #lighttheworld #bethelight #wearamask #washyourhands #socialdistance #serveoneanother #loveoneanother❤️ #spreadlove #respectyourelders #dementia #dementiaawareness #alzheimersassociation #alzheimers #alzheimersawareness #endalz💜","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#weddingweekend","#thankyou","#payitforward","#staytuned","#weddingservice","#weddings","#elopement","#servicespecials","#bethechangeyouwanttoseeintheworld","#bekind","#endracism","#thankful","#thankfulandblessed","#blessedwiththebest","#lovemyjob","#lighttheworld","#bethelight","#wearamask","#washyourhands","#socialdistance","#serveoneanother","#loveoneanother❤️","#spreadlove","#respectyourelders","#dementia","#dementiaawareness","#alzheimersassociation","#alzheimers","#alzheimersawareness","#endalz💜"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Kitty on August 07, 2020.

For me, the more simple the idea, the easier it is to dive deep with it. I picture health in four pillars. Internal, External, Emotional, and Social. \n\nMy goals for this year were to travel more and save money. Well, I had no idea what 2020 had instore.  Instead of going everywhere I stayed home and instead of working my normal 50+ hour work week I took three months off (best decision I ever made). One thing that can not be ignored this year is the dramatic impact on our social health.\n\nSocial Health: The way we interact with others\n\nWhat about social health hasn\u2019t changed this year? Travel, festivals, bars and restaurants. All of our normal face to face tools for social interaction has been altered. We\u2019ve been forced into the endless blackhole of internet and media entertainment ( #TigerKing ). Now that things are opening back up (kinda) we are re learning how to interact with society. People's level of organic engagement has been on the decline for years.  We went from \u201Cstranger danger\u201D to online dating pretty quickly. People have quickly realized that a fraction of natural social interaction they had before, even just at work or the grocery store, had a positive impact on their life. Now, with anxiety high and mask on, we have to learn how to make friends and be a part of our communities again or maybe for the first time.\nSuffering from social anxiety?

Choose one friend or loved one who may be facing something tough or is taking on a big challenge. Leave them a note every day for 30 days.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n2. Add a note to a meal and drop it on a friend's porch so she doesn't have to cook tonight. (This also works well with a latte or bottle of wine!)⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n3. Pick some flowers from your garden and add a note with encouraging words before gifting them to someone.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n4. Bless a stranger by leaving a note of encouragement for the person working at the desk of you doctor's office, library, favorite cafe, or greeting people at church.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nHow will YOU use encouraging words to spread kindness this week?

In this context, #SmartDistancing implies that people who have an increased risk due to contact with an infected person are warned personally, e.g. by an Infection App, and then reduce their social contacts individually, and, depending on the risk, may be sent to #quarantine at home. \nThe measure of social distance is thus specifically reduced to people who have had contact with infected persons, while more freedom remains for others. \n\nA model analysis has shown that well implemented \u201CSmart Distancing\u201C can make infection control much more effective while at the same time cause less social and economic collateral damage.","NumberOfLikes":7,"Hashtags":["#SocialDistancing","#COVID19","#contacttracing","#SmartDistancing","#quarantine"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Data4Life on August 07, 2020.

We went to visit the old #LovelandCemetery and it was truly something to behold. It was established in 1908 and, to the best of my knowledge, the last burial took place in 1914. It contains only 12 graves and is the final resting place of 4 \"Woodmen Of The World\". Their graves are marked with beautiful tree stump shaped headstones, just a little trivia for you, #WoodmenOfTheWorld is a \"Not-for-profit fraternal benefit society founded in 1890 that operates a privately held insurance company for its members\" according to their website and these tree stump headstones are included in their life insurance packages for all members. They're technically a \"secret society\" and I highly recommend y'all doing a little research on them and their fun approach to death pools, writing rituals, Masonic influence, and community service. The oldest person buried in this cemetery was 46 at the time of his death and there are 3 infants buried here. \nThe Loveland Cemetery is one of the most peaceful and idyllic small cemeteries that I've spent time photographing. If you're ever in the area, stop in and pay your respects ... it's a bit of a hike, through tall grass, up to the graves but it's worth it once you're there. \n#Oklahoma #DeathLaHoma #Cemetery #FindAgrave #LifeOnTheGreatPlains #DeathOnTheGreatPlains #SecretSociety #OklahomaCemetery #Graveyard #Headstone","NumberOfLikes":29,"Hashtags":["#JescoDogWhite","#SocialDistance","#LovelandCemetery","#WoodmenOfTheWorld","#Oklahoma","#DeathLaHoma","#Cemetery","#FindAgrave","#LifeOnTheGreatPlains","#DeathOnTheGreatPlains","#SecretSociety","#OklahomaCemetery","#Graveyard","#Headstone"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1596770819,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 07 05:26:59 CEST 2020","Location":"Loveland, Oklahoma"},{"CaptionText":"Good Morning 🙏  Have a nice & safe day 💞  ശുഭ ദിനാശംസകൾ...💕🌹Use Soap & Mask and keep Social Distancing to avoid Covid19 Corona virus infection. \n\nകൂടുതലൽ വിവരങ്ങൾക്ക് വിളിക്കുക 📲 9497879710\n________________________________\nLike, Tag, Share, Follow & Support \n@dabspaintshardwares\n#DABSPaintsAndHardwares #Mukkola #Vizhinjam #Thiruvananthapuram\n📲 +919497879710\n📧 dabsassociates@gmail.com\nhttps:\/\/dabspaints.business.site\nhttps:\/\/m.facebook.com\/DABSPaints\/\n________________________________\n#DABS_PAINTS_HARDWARES #DABS #paints #hardwares #Berger #Indigo #Asian #MRF #Deluxe #Accessories #brush #mdf #wood #lock #padlock #rollerbrush #bestoffers #topselling 💰🔐🔧🔗🛠️🎊🌈🌔⏳🏘️🛒🛍️\n\nസാധാരണക്കാരന്റെ ബഡ്ജറ്റില്\u200D മനോഹരമായി വീടിന്റെ പെയിന്റിങ് ജോലികൾ  നടത്തി കൊടുക്കുന്നു  കൂടുതലൽ വിവരങ്ങൾക്ക് വിളിക്കുക 📲 9497879710\n\nഡാബ്സ്\u200C പെയിന്റ് & ഹാർഡ്\u200Cവെയറിൽ നിന്നും നിങ്ങൾക്ക്  പ്രമുഖ കമ്പനികളുടെ പെയിന്ററും \nഹാർഡ്\u200Cവെയർ ഐറ്റങ്ങളും മൊത്തമായും ചില്ലറയായും ലഭിക്കുന്നതാണ്. വിലക്കുറവിൻ വിസ്മയം DABS. \n\n#goodmorning #staysafe #usemask #maskchallenge #socialdistance #breakthechain #covid19kerala","NumberOfLikes":7,"Hashtags":["#DABSPaintsAndHardwares","#Mukkola","#Vizhinjam","#Thiruvananthapuram","#DABS_PAINTS_HARDWARES","#DABS","#paints","#hardwares","#Berger","#Indigo","#Asian","#MRF","#Deluxe","#Accessories","#brush","#mdf","#wood","#lock","#padlock","#rollerbrush","#bestoffers","#topselling","#goodmorning","#staysafe","#usemask","#maskchallenge","#socialdistance","#breakthechain","#covid19kerala"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by DABS Paints & Hardwares in DABS Paints & Hardwares with @its_trivandrum, @mdf.danial, @tripocosmic_gene, @eat_at_tvm, @insta_vizhinjam, @poonamtrilokchandhani, @sandhyasbk, @sandhyasbk2018, @sbtrendzonline, @theart_gg, @srapangode, @dabs_paints.hardwares, @nanduseban, @shibud972, @bijujagadevanaji, @manirul._sk, @fathimayusra7, and @sandhya_sbtrendz.

I hadn\u2019t been there since 1996? 97? Boy was I in for a surprise! I didn\u2019t know it was now a work in progress park! The hangars and barracks were still there, most of the flight line intact, but now there was a carousel, a museum, a playground, wide open grass fields, and a balloon ride! It was that big orange balloon that drew me to it. I was curious to see what it was whenever I drove by and saw it from the freeway. Even though we didn\u2019t live in the immediate area, my son and I would frequent that park. Because it was so big, so open, and so empty, it was the ideal place to play. We didn\u2019t have to worry about cars, or people. We used to go there just to be alone. We spent so much time there over this last decade. As a ten\/11 month old it\u2019s where my boy perfected walking, and as he go older, running. It\u2019s where he learned to climb, where he learned to ride a tricycle, a bicycle, a bike without training wheels, and still even later where we spent a lot of time skating on the ice with hockey. It seems ironic and sad that we used to go there to get away from it all, but haven\u2019t been anywhere near it since March, since this all started. I was hopeful we\u2019d be back by July, but as we finish this first week of August, I wonder...

Patience and stoicism are akin to inner peace and acceptance, we need stoicism to tolerate the change and patience to implement those new behavioural traits, one thing is for sure, life as we knew it will never be the same, not even with a vaccine.\n\nThere are quite a few things that we can do for ourselves besides our daily training, being one of them the healthy habit of #meditation to help us cope with anxiety and depression. Through meditation we can return to ourselves, to our core and reset our cosmovision, just remember, as they say, you should meditate 10 minutes a day unless you are really busy, in that case you should meditate for 20 minutes!

According to Bruce Arians, \u201Che\u2019ll be our main guy\u201D, and everyone else will be vying for playing time. I still love Vaughn as a top tier handcuff in that offense and with his particular skillset, but ROJO being the RB1 easily means he\u2019s in for (at least) 15-20 carries a game and the lion share of the offensive series. For crying out loud, the RB1 of a fire offense has an ADP of 7.11. You can\u2019t find too many starting backs with that ADP. \nI was a big fan of his coming out of college, but never drafted him. I had concerns about his catching ability, but he\u2019s improved upon that last year. Last season, he finished with 724 rushing yards off 172 carries and 6 TDs. He also hauled in 31 receptions (40 targets) and another 309 yards. I\u2019m all aboard the ROJO hype train.

They talked about the 7-year-old German Shepherd who had the Coronavirus and possibly died from it. The owners saw the sign of COVID in their dog and was able to get him tested. The dog, Buddy, was tested twice, the first time the results came back positive and the second time he tested negative, but he was still sick. Buddy was suspected to have lymphoma that they found in his blood work. They are not sure if the Coronavirus made the cancer worse, or if he died from COVID. The reason they are not sure what Buddy died from, is because he did not have a necropsy (\u201Cis the examination of an animal after death\u201D) (no fault to the owners).\n:\nThis was just a brief summary of what they talked about. If you would like to watch the whole video to get more information on buddy and dogs getting COVID head over to @thezendogla to watch.
