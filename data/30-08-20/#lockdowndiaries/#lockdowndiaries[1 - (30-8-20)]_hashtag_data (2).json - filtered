Plus, not much to do during these ubiquitous lockdown days (go coronaa, corona gooooo!!!). I drew this portrait of my darling sister to start with. I would say the end product did excite me a bit given I only made use of simple sketching techniques I learned during my school days more than a decade ago.\n\nThe best thing I like about sketching is how with every stroke the sketch starts getting more lively as if it will crawl out of the paper when it's done. \n\nHopefully this will not be the end of it and there will be more to come.

With men and children at home and maids in theirs, it has been a nightmare for many to cope up with the extra workload while fulfilling our never ending craving for foods and resulting pile of utensils. Though many men and children have been helpful with the other chores of the house, but the fact that still remains legit is that kitchen work comes equivalent to everything else combined.\nThe effort required to cook is comparatively less than that required to do the dishes, especially in big families when maids are still on leave. \nSo, this lockdown we have come up with a strategy of helping our mom in doing the dishes. Every member of our family has pledged to clean their own dishes after every meal ( if there's some in sink, clean that too). This takes only a few seconds extra and leaves only the few dishes in which food was cooked to be cleaned ( You can take that too). Instead of a single person( or two people) taking the charge of cooking and cleaning each, every member of the house can contribute their bit to cleaning. This helps the ladies of the house to get some time for themselves too. Afterall, they too crave for their \" me times\" as much as we do.\nOnce the work's done, they too can be the winners of the game, rather than shouting from the kitchen \" kaun jeeta\".\n\n#sharetheload#helpeachother#familytime#bekind#lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":0,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by @misslazywonders on August 29, 2020 tagging @tedthestoner, and @tweakindia.

And for my parents, it was some more time to visit their beautiful little piece of green treasure which they are taking care of and which in turn nourishes them and all of us. \n\nFeaturing here a beautifully tuned rare gem of a song, by Mahakavi Subramaniya Bharatiyar on Bhoomi Devi or Mother earth, set to tune by Dr Mangalampalli Balamuralikrishna in the regal ragam Simhendramadyamam, learnt from his student and my guru and mentor Aswathy Tirunal Rama Varma. \n\nThe paintings are done by Neel based on nature and also some beautiful videos from my dad's farm which has a butterfly zone amidst all the lush greenery. We can connect with nature in many ways. A little bit of gratitude and love for the mother who cares for us all, will go a very long way. These are few skills and experiences which we treasure for life. \n\nThankyou @chef_avin for tagging me and inspiring us to make this video. True artists connect in more than many ways. Be it on stage, or the kitchen or in life üòÑ\n\n#skillsesmile #worldskills #lockdowndiaries #art #music #farming #motherearth #inspiredliving","NumberOfLikes":20,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":6,"Timestamp":1598727567,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 29 20:59:27 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Yes I\u2019m proud.

Long or short term, it doesn\u2019t matter. My fitness transformation journey also started that way only. \n\nMy WORKOUT DIARY is my everything! I planned and drafted my workouts and wrote it down every single day. It\u2019s very important to track this record and it helped me in understanding the limits of my body as well. It just got better and better. These were the initial days of my fitness journey. \n\nI fixed my goal both long term and short term. Back then Long term was to be at my best fit which I\u2019m in right now. Short term goals were simple ones like for example 500 single under in a day to 550 or 600 the next day.

Despite the pressure of financial instability, the lockdown has given me the space and time to work on my art without needing to meet social engagements that I would rather avoid anyway. Of course, there have been sources of frustration. Income is unpredictable, particularly as I used to depend on workshops at schools and libraries in a pre-Covid world. Writing fiction for a living is a joke, and performers are practically expected to perform \u201Cfor exposure\u201D. Additionally, I had two new books release just pre-lockdown, books that suddenly could not be distributed or promoted. With bookshops shut and book events out of the question, I floundered for a bit. Yet, things moved online, and I soon discovered that online events work well, perhaps even better than physical events, for a book sale is just a couple of clicks away!\nWithout all the time spent on travelling to conduct workshops, I\u2019ve also found myself writing more and more. Online dance classes are a new experience and though I have neither created nor learnt anything new in this time, dance keeps me active at a time when it is easy for lethargy to set in. I enjoy dancing in my own space, practising, and keeping my body active and alert. With the energy that dance brings, I write. To be honest, this is a time I\u2019ve loved. I\u2019ve been lucky to have found other projects to keep me going financially, and I\u2019ve had more time to write fiction than ever before!\n\n@varshaseshan  is a children\u2019s author and a classical dancer. She has written 19 books for\nchildren and has twice been shortlisted for the Scholastic Asian Book Award. She has been\npractising Bharatanatyam for over 25 years, and has performed extensively in India and abroad. \nIf you or your artist friends have a story to share, connect with us.\n.\n.\n.\n#Artistslockedin \n#Artistsoftheworld #artistsupportartists #artistsofPune #authors #dance #dancersdairies #lockdowndiaries #childrensbooks #danceonline #authorsofinstagram #writingmystory #artescape","NumberOfLikes":30,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598614239,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 28 13:30:39 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Kya bolti hai public iss baare me?üòÇ\n.\n.\n.\n#kpopmemes, #btsmemes, #memes4ever, #memesfunny, #memesbrasil, #memesbrasileiros, #memes, #lockdowncrafts, #lockdownfitness, #lockdownwedding, #lockdownindia, #lockdowndiaries, #lockdownrecipes, #lockdownmemes, #viratkohlimotivation, #viratkohliofficiall, #viratkohliuniverse, #viratkohliforever, #viratkohlifanclub18, #viratkohli18, #viratkohlifanpage","NumberOfLikes":29,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Memes | 18+ üîû üîµ on August 28, 2020 tagging @anushkasharma, @virat.kohli, and @singleguyforever.

Being a part of this exhibition is a true honour as it\u2019s showing a part of history that completely changed the world. \n\nOn March 20, the International Center of Photography announced an open call for imagemakers around the world to post and tag imagery of their experiences as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded. Photojournalism and documentary pictures sit with staged and more metaphorical photographs. Amateur smartphone pictures are being uploaded alongside the work of professional imagemakers from around the world. A whole range of emotions are present: anger, despair, loss, confusion, frustration, boredom, loneliness, strength, and resolve.\nThen, on May 25, George Floyd, a Black man, was killed in Minneapolis by a white police officer and millions came out of isolation to gather in anger and defiance of centuries of systemic racism and white supremacy. Thousands of #ICPConcerned images of the demonstrations were uploaded and shared.\nNow, ICP has initiated an evolving #ICPConcerned exhibition One thousand images are being chosen by a wide range of ICP staff\u2014curators, administrators, and educators. No one can visit yet, but the process and the installation are being documented and shown online, taking the images back to the worldwide audience that made them.

I have been ordering one thing over n over again and that is \nToum -  Lebanese garlic sauc.\n Have practically made use of Toum in every  which way I could üôà\n\nListing out few bits here  using Toum, created \r\n\r\nSalad dressing with olive oil, pepper, honey & mustard\r\nPlum mutton marination\r\nShwarma marination\r\nSalad dressing with orange zest\r\nHumous spread for  bagels\/Kashmiri Telvor\r\nDip with cucumber & erved with Masch (Kashmiri meat balls)\r\nSpread for Varmoth (Kashmiri small black\/purple beans) and served with Pita pockets\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s no surprise I kind of like to tweak my Kashmiri food and offer a slight Middle Eastern touch.  Believe it or not, our Kashmiri food has a lot of similarities with Persian, Middle Eastern & Afghani cuisine. One day I would like to create a range focusing on mixing an element or two from these regions so I  create food that speaks of Harmony, Love & Joy\n\nThank you @mortarsandpestles.kt\n\nWe deliver across Bangalore, please DM for more\n\n #kashmiricuisine#quaratinelife #loveforfood #fusionshuzon#bangalorehotels #pastes #kashmiriyat#indianfoosfestival#brunchseries #bangalorefoodies#foodbloggers #foodgoals #lockdowndiaries #specialfood#brunch #thesupperclubbyzafran#picoftheday #muttonlovers #veganrecipes #vegetarians #zafrancouture #thesupperclubbyzafran #totalfoodies #bangalorehub #foodcoma#homechefs #wazwan#lebanesefood","NumberOfLikes":13,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Neetu on August 25, 2020.

I did some stories to go along with this about how everything in the kitchen is labelled and I don\u2019t want it to be like an institution but it\u2019s what helps us (mainly me) keep sane. Dougie doesn\u2019t care about where things go, it\u2019s not a priority to him and I\u2019m not going to force it to be a priority for him but it is to me. I was getting narky at him when things weren\u2019t in their spot and I felt shit about it because it\u2019s not his problem, plus there was no official spots for anything. So I had to come up with a solution and that was everything has a place and a label and there will be no more me getting mad at Dougie for no reason üòÇ except there was a few \u201Cwhat the fuck is a ramekin?\u201D or \u201Chow do I know what a tapas dish is?\u201D The end of the day this stuff winds me up when I go to cook something and I can\u2019t find what I need and I have to ask, and I never want to get mad at Dougie for things  around the house (which is why we came up with a roster to share all chores equally because I don\u2019t like telling him what to do) Dougie is not lazy, he is so tidy. I often say I am clean but messy. I care about the detail, the walls being clean, fans dusted, drains clean etc but I don\u2019t mind if there is a pile of clothes that sit there for a week or if I leave the butter and milk out of the fridge. Whereas that drives Dougie crazy, he is tidy but would never think to dust the light shades or clean the light switches and door handles but he stands around me when I\u2019m cooking putting things away and cleaning the dishes as i cook üòÇ we are made up differently but we want to live in harmony. Your partner doesn\u2019t have to care about what you care about but they have to respect it. Often our partners don\u2019t know half the things we do to run a household, until you write it down and split down the middle so they see what it takes for a clean, organised and happy home to run smoothly. Yes we wish that our partners will just do things without us telling them to do it, that would be ideal, but some people need guidance and that\u2019s ok. Once you make the list and split it, you don\u2019t have to talk about it ever again. üíï","NumberOfLikes":17,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598311723,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 01:28:43 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"1918 to 2020\u2060\n\u2060\n\u2060\n\u2060\n\u2060\n #staysafe #quarantine #lockdowngoals #stayhomestaysafe #lockdownday11 #lockdown #lockdownlife #lockdowndiaries\u2060 \u2060#history #pandemic #wearyourmask #facemask #facemaskmeme #wearyourmask","NumberOfLikes":26,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Munchable on August 24, 2020.
