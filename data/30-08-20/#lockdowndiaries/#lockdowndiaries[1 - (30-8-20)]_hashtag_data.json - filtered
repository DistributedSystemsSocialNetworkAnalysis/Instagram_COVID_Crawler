Was so disappointed as sinces 2 months it was not recovering due to which all my activities were shut downed. No more leg movement complete bedrest can't even think of Zumba. Got so stressed that even started over eating which led to weight gain and depression. After two n half month of regular physio and medicines got recovered. But at that time was weighted almost 57 kg 😭 as a part of fitness industry it was unacceptable for me to see myself as skin became loose , bulges in stomach, bloating of stomach, back pain , menstruation problem and lot more☹️😖. I was under shock (kya hogaya ) i can't do Zumba as due to weight gain my moves were not able to be seen clear and even people started pointing me n taunting me about weight gain 😒. As days went it went on n on all the bullshit. But life always gives a second chance to who r willing to do so. \n\nFrom July 28 decided to work on myself ignoring all the bullshit . As I always say \"never ever give up\"🤞. Did all the cardio, weight training, running, strength training and yes my favourite Zumba🏋🚴💪💃 .

Long or short term, it doesn\u2019t matter. My fitness transformation journey also started that way only. \n\nMy WORKOUT DIARY is my everything! I planned and drafted my workouts and wrote it down every single day. It\u2019s very important to track this record and it helped me in understanding the limits of my body as well. It just got better and better. These were the initial days of my fitness journey. \n\nI fixed my goal both long term and short term. Back then Long term was to be at my best fit which I\u2019m in right now. Short term goals were simple ones like for example 500 single under in a day to 550 or 600 the next day. So I set my short term goals now and then, achieved it and wrote it down. I gave very much importance to them. \nCrushing your short term goals is the way to reach your long term goal. \nTHEY ARE VERY IMPORTANT!!!\n\n\u201CThis is not an ADVICE\u201D.

So I melted it in a double boiler, added fresh cream, a dash of sugar and salt and stirred it into this gorgeous, shining chocolate mousse-like thing! I also chopped up a golden kiwi, whipped it with some cream and milk powder to make a sweetish fruity mix. I crushed Marie biscuits with my mortar and pestle, poured a layer at the bottom of the glass. If I had some orange juice I would've added a spritz but I didn't, so just lined the sides with kiwi slices, layered on the kiwi cream in the middle, and topped it up with the dark chocolate, another layer of kiwi cream and a thin layer of the molten chocolate swirled using a toothpick.

Money is definitely needed, but how much money do we really need? If we would change our idea of a successful life to a joyful life, we would find our need for money would dramatically decrease.

We've planted just 2-3 plants of each type of vegetable. The plants have grown beautifully and provide us 100% organic vegetables. This way of growing vegetables doesn't need much space, much investment nor much effort. You just  need to water them on time and take good care of the plants.

And the first few days passed without much worry. When it started appearing that the fight against the virus is long-drawn, I have started to become a bit more uneasy. The situation has rendered us helpless in ways that we cannot imagine. I saw a lot of my friends picking up new hobbies & producing content in & around the idea of a lockdown. I have instead chosen to do the most mundane, household tasks like helping my mother in her chores & work. That takes a considerable amount of my daily time. The rest, I spent in actively getting back to reading fiction. I aim to finish a novel per week. Some days, I have managed to finish two. This is in addition to what I am expected to read for my research work. \n\nAs far as my creative pursuits are concerned, I often get asked if I am using the lockdown period to write a new play. The answer has been negative so far. With so much going around, I don\u2019t know if one can afford cognitive isolation that is required to produce new work. Instead, I have been re-writing my last play in Hindi for a possible production next year. I am also finishing off pending administrative tasks for our theatre company. We were scheduled to commemorate the 70th anniversary of our theatre company in May 2020 with an array of events but all of it had to be called off. So we are also brainstorming to commemorate this moment virtually. All this, while being acutely aware that I have a roof over my head and the ability to feed myself.\n\nKaustubh Naik is a recipient of the Tendulkar-Dubey fellowship & his play, Avyahat, was recently staged at the International Theatre Festival of Kerala. An incoming doctoral student at the University of Pennsylvania, he has previously studied at Ambedkar University and JNU. He shares few images of his production, Avyahat (2018).

While we are infinitely grateful to be sheltered in the most amazing country, we also felt like we were indefinitely putting our lives on hold. There are things we should attend to back at home. \n\nOur return date coincided with the discovery of new community transmission in Auckland. It was a rude awakening that the pandemic is long from over. New lockdown in Auckland made our exit even more anxiety inducing. I was constantly in communication with our Airbnb host to ensure we can still stay there before our flight. Of course, I also worried about our flight being canceled the last minute. Worst of all I had to scratch my original plan of restaurant hopping in the city due to everything being closed in level 3 restriction.\n\nWe spent our last day of freedom getting haircuts for everyone. I have no idea when we will be able to do this again without wearing masks and being worried about getting or giving the virus.

Usually it has all purpose flour in it but this time to make it healthy I skipped that totally, instead used maize flour and some rice flour. \nI also tried to give a twist in the form of shape and color  so rather than regular tacos we have baked beetroot Taco cups.\n\nIngredients :\nTaco cups:\nMaize flour- 1 cup\nRice flour- 1tbsp\nGram flour- 1 tbsp\nBeetroot puree- 2 tbsp( for colored tacos) \nWater-1\/2 cup for regular tortillas \nOlive oil- 2 tsp\nSalt- 1\/2 tsp\nMexican seasoning- 1 tsp\n\nGuacamole :\nAvocado - 1 mashed \nTomato- 1 diced \nOnion- 1 diced\nChopped fresh coriander\nGarlic chopped - 1tsp\nSalt - 1\/2 tsp\nPaprika- 1\/4 tsp\nLime juice- 1tsp\n\nHerbed rice, Refried beans, Mexican salsa, Cheesy curd dip, Fresh salad were other layers whose ingredients can be found in my 'Mexican Burrito Bowl' recipe. \n \nMethod:\nFor Tacos, mix everything together to make a dough. Roll it out between two parchment papers and layer it in bakeware safe bowl giving a cup shape. Bake at 180 deg C for 15 min. \nThere might be some cracks while putting it in the bowl so just add some dough to repair it😀\n\nLayer it with other ingredients and is ready to serve. \nThis recipe goes as my contribution towards #healthybakesforgram \nUnder Savoury bake theme\nHosted by @thegourmettherapy @bakeinline @food.marvels.vc @adhyayan_sahay \nSponsored by @ossoroflavours @tripti_crafteria \nFeatured by @yesindia \n\nTagging @ananyaghosh90\n@ediblestories.neha @food_feed_fiesta \nto participate. \n\n#NehaTheDentistGram\n#mexicantacos #tacosarelife #tacosbae #tacosway  #foodstylingandphotography #foodstyleguide #buzzfeedindia #foodtalkindia #wahindia #veggiebowl #foodbloggersofinstagram #healthyeatingtips #healthyrecipies #vegetariandinner #vegetarianmeals #lockdowndiaries #foodnetworkthekitchen #f52gramsfoodpic #f52community #bangalorefoodiesclub #bangalorefoodblogger #platingfood #bakingcooking #delish😋 #homechefsofinstagram #foodtalkindia #foodiesofinsta #indianfoodiesquad #foodgasms \n@wahhindia @buzzfeedindia @buzzfeedfood @yesindiafoods","NumberOfLikes":72,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":39,"Timestamp":1598411432,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 26 05:10:32 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"ᴛʀᴜsᴛ ᴍᴇ ɪ ʜᴀᴠᴇɴ'ᴛ ᴄᴏᴏᴋᴇᴅ ɴᴏᴏᴅʟᴇs sᴏ ʏᴜᴍᴍʏ ɪɴ ᴛʜᴇ ʟᴀsᴛ 10 ʏᴇᴀʀ's, ᴀs ɪ ᴄᴏᴏᴋᴇᴅ ʏᴇsᴛᴇʀᴅᴀʏ 🥰😍\n.\n.\n𝑆𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝐿𝑜𝑣𝑒 𝑡𝑜 𝑤𝒉𝑜𝑙𝑒 𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑙𝑑, 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑦 𝒉𝑜𝑚𝑒, 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑦 𝑠𝑎𝑓𝑒🙏\n.\n.\n🌍Book shoots at your budget: www.khalsaraajphotography.com\n.\n🍜INFRAME: Noodles \n📸SHOT BY: @Manjot4u\n🎬FRAMED BY: @KHALSARAAJPHOTOGRAPHY & @framesbymanjot\n📧Email: manjot@theinfifun.com\n---------------------------------------------------------\nWhatsApp for photoshoots\/Collab (freshers most welcome): 📲8092158070\n---------------------------------------------------------\n📩DM for more Business inquiries.\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLIGHTROOM CUSTOM PRESETS PACK AVAILABLE DM FOR PRICING INFO\n--------------------------------------------------\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#noodles #noodleslover #chinnesecuisine #lovefood #khalsaraajphotography #noodlestime #Manjot4u #manjotsinghphotography #manjotsinghkhalsa #framesbymanjot #selfmadecusturd #photography #photographer #Photoshoots #Foodblogger #Foodlovers #blogger #vegnoodles #cravings #cuisines #Homemadenoodles #foodlovers #lovefornoodles #cuisine #wednesday #blogs #lockdowndiaries #Photographs #instalove #Cookbook","NumberOfLikes":423,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by 💕💞 © 🅼αηנσт 🆂ιηgн 🅺нαℓsα 💞💕 in Delhi, India with @manjot4u, @khalsaraajphotography, @framesbymanjot, and @iammanjot4u.

For me it is having the time to enjoy the simple things in life, from watching nature change into its finest clothing has been a real joy, it has allowed a sense of connection with nature and wildlife on a deeper level. The time to share a chat with neighbours that we hardly ever spoke to before and the real camaraderie of sharing and helping one another is one that I hope will last into the future, it has been so comforting to know that others too have the time to converse and are willing to do so, rather than racing off to face another working day. These are all pretty simple things but have made a huge difference in peoples lives, especially those that live alone and long may it continue. I have added some of my drawings that I have been working on during this time, which is my way of using all the extra time to be creative which in turn helps to diffuse the impact of the pandemic. #contemporaryart #oilpastel #oilpastels #oilpastelonpaper #landscapedrawing #drawing #drawings #covid19 #covid_19 #covid  #lockdown #lockdown2020 #lockdownlife #lockdowndiaries #pandemic #pandemic2020 #wellbeing #wellbeingjourney #mindfulness #mindful","NumberOfLikes":90,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Elaine Fox on August 25, 2020.

Being a part of this exhibition is a true honour as it\u2019s showing a part of history that completely changed the world. \n\nOn March 20, the International Center of Photography announced an open call for imagemakers around the world to post and tag imagery of their experiences as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded. Photojournalism and documentary pictures sit with staged and more metaphorical photographs. Amateur smartphone pictures are being uploaded alongside the work of professional imagemakers from around the world. A whole range of emotions are present: anger, despair, loss, confusion, frustration, boredom, loneliness, strength, and resolve.\nThen, on May 25, George Floyd, a Black man, was killed in Minneapolis by a white police officer and millions came out of isolation to gather in anger and defiance of centuries of systemic racism and white supremacy. Thousands of #ICPConcerned images of the demonstrations were uploaded and shared.\nNow, ICP has initiated an evolving #ICPConcerned exhibition One thousand images are being chosen by a wide range of ICP staff\u2014curators, administrators, and educators. No one can visit yet, but the process and the installation are being documented and shown online, taking the images back to the worldwide audience that made them. Eventually, the returning public will be able to come see a visual account of this tumultuous era.\n\nLink in bio\n\nImage 1  Gallery installation courtesy of International Centre Of Photography\n\nImage 2 When You Can\u2019t Get To The Nail Salon \n\n#icpconcerned #photographersinisolation #london #harrow #harrowonline #ukphotographersinisolation #isolation #photography #documentaryphotography \n#lockdown #MassIsolation #MassIsolationFORMAT #covid_19 #womenphotographers #womeninphotography #timeoutlondon #formatfestival #lensculture #documentary #originalphotographers #wsp_covid19 #quarantinephotography #quarantine #resolvedisolation #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":32,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1598376336,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 19:25:36 CEST 2020","Location":"ICP - International Center of Photography"},{"CaptionText":"Flashback Memory\n\n#lockdowndiaries #coronavirus #covid19","NumberOfLikes":82,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Grishmaraj Chavda on August 25, 2020.

The lover of food and desserts, Lord Ganesha was returning home after having a hearty meal, when he stumbled and rolled over on his belly. The Moon saw it from high above, and burst into a cynical laughter that miffed Lord Ganesha, and compelled him to curse him. Lord Ganesha cursed the moon to disappear from the sky completely, while he begged for forgiveness. Ultimately, the generous Lord Ganesha gave in to his requests, but since he couldn't revoke the curse, he reduced the disappearance span of the moon from the sky to one day.\nLord Ganesha's story explains how anger gets to the best of us, but it is our power to overcome it that makes us a better human being.\n\n#bappamorya #ganeshmandala #mandalaartist #sakuragellyroll #sketch_fortress #mandalatutoriallovesmywork #feature_your_talent #planetofmandalas #brilliantmandalas #mandalasharingpage #potpourriofartists #artsyjayas #artlovesartlover #mandalafeaturingpage #crazyforsharingmandalas #lockdowndiaries #staysafe #staymotivated","NumberOfLikes":24,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Amandeep Kaur in India with @zenart.features, @_mandala_drawings, @mandalas.tahay, @dnbrothers_stationeryfineart, @i.love.sharing.mandala, @brilliant_mandalas, @mandalaloversofficial, @passion_creation_magic, @gammoartdreams, @worldwide.mandala, @diaryofmandalalovers, and @planetofmandalas.","NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598369314,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 17:28:34 CEST 2020","Location":"India"},{"CaptionText":"Gulab Jamun 😋😋😋\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nFollow me @foodie_shreyaa\nFollow me @foodie_shreyaa\nUse #foodie_shreyaa to get featured \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#gulabjamun #gulabjamuns\n#desertlife\n#indiandesert #desertphotography\n#sweettooth #photoframes #lockdowndiaries  #photographerslife #photographers_of_indian\n#clickshot18mm #photographie\n#fotografia #photographyeveryday #photography📷 #birdlife_insta\n#photo_  #travelphotography #lockdown2020😷 #pictureoftheday #naturephotography #naturelove #phonephotography_id #instagrammers #food_mania #foodie_shreyaa","NumberOfLikes":219,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Shreya's food_mania 🍕🥪🥘🍲 in Delhi, India with @patros_kitchen, @pratzstark, @tulis_food, @foodiefantacy, @up_eats, @photographersoffuzia, @food.lover.0.0, @instafood_sarita, @foodie_shreyaa, @foodiee._.girl, @_foodshala_, @joey.doesnt.share.food_xo, @foodie_pupp, @foodiezurich, @foo_dieforeever, @thefoodylife1, @recipesglobe, @born2eat.blog, @dazzling_food06, and @foodiesntraveller.

The reviews all said the layer of banana between the ice cream and the crust made it super hard to cut so I opted for bananas on top instead! \n2. Replaced the layer of banana with a layer of chocolate to keep the crust crunchy! Check out fun facts for why 🤔\n\nTips and Tricks 🧑\u200D🍳\n1. Allow each layer of ice cream to complete freeze before adding the next layer to avoid flavours mixing! We waited WAY longer than the 20 minutes called for - closer to 2 hours!\n2. A silicon cake pan is perfect to use as it makes the pie so easy to remove! \n\nFun fact 🎁\nAs a Food Scientist one of my most memorable classes was the one where we learned about chocolate coating on the inside of ice cream cones sold ready to eat (like Drumsticks or Cornetto)🍦. The coating is fat-based so forms a barrier that stops the moisture from the ice cream moving to the cone and making it soggy. It's essential to a good Drumstick or Cornetto. Those that first put them on the market spent tons of time and money on scientists 👩\u200D🔬 to figure out a way to not let the chocolate pool at the bottom of the cone, only to find out after they did that people actually love the chocolate ends! 😅 \n\n#buzzfeedtasty #cupcakeproject #bananasplitday #bananasplit #bananasplitpie #bananaspliticecreampie #icecream #pie #pies #homemadepie #homemadepies #icecreampie #neapolitan #neapolitanicecream #neopolitanicecreampie #caramelisedbanana #caramelisedbananas #caramelizedbananas #caramelizedbananas #icecream #dessert #desserts #f52gram #cookingstories2020 #cuisine_captures #f52grams #3rookiecooks #melbournefoodie #quaranteam #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":570,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":98,"Timestamp":1598361202,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 15:13:22 CEST 2020","Location":"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia"},{"CaptionText":"Feeling my vibes right now.\n\nIsn't it lovely, how travelling heals your soul and mind. \n\n#idukki_stories #mypulsarofficial #traveltherapy #travelgram #lockdowndiaries #cloudporn #nature_perfection","NumberOfLikes":468,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598361183,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 15:13:03 CEST 2020","Location":"Idukki"},{"CaptionText":"#skincarelover #skincaretips #skincare #explore#skincareblogger #seersecrets #chennaiblogger#lockdowndiaries #quarantine #quarantinelife #nofilter #other #instafamily #reels #series #search #nofilter #nofilterneeded #makingvideos #trending","NumberOfLikes":8,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598359493,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 14:44:53 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#parrotdating #storyfrommywindow  #lockdowndiaries #dahuez #indiaphotoarchivefoundation","NumberOfLikes":18,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Shilpa Poonattil in Jains Pebble Brook Appartment.

How sweet is that! \n.\nMy earliest memories of these little golden rings is from the time slot of childhood in Solan, Himachal Pradesh. After Sunday Church Service in a tiny chapel inside our school, my parents would walk us 3 ducklings along into the market. Then into a little street off to the left, a mithaiwalla stirring his kadhai of glistening oil, scooping out huge Punjabi samosas, like a magician from a cauldron. Inside his shop, in a setup of maybe 4 tables with 4 chairs each, my father would get us either the samosas with tangy imli chutney (so typically north Indian), or the hot jalebis in a katori with milk. Sometimes both. Oh happy days! \n.\nJalebis in hot milk. Delicious beyond dreams.\n.\nAlso known as zulbia, jilapi, mushabak and zalabia, JALEBI is an Arab & Indian sweet snack popular all over South Asia, and the Middle East. It is made by deep-frying all-purpose flour batter in circular shapes, which are then soaked in sugar syrup. This dessert can be served warm or cold.\n.\n.\nExperiments in the time of Covid19.

The cream may be aromatized with coffee, vanilla, or other flavourings. 🍮\n\nIts name literally means \u201Ccooked cream\".A bite of panna cotta is remarkably creamy, melting in the mouth without a trace of grittiness or lumps.\n\nSo I've been experimenting my flavours with this little gorgeous jiggle and it always manages to keep me content. \n\nMy inbox is currently loaded with so many messages asking me how to put up \"The perfect wobble\". The goal with panna cotta is to calibrate the amount of gelatin to the dairy and its fat so you achieve a firm set that is still delicate and wobbly.\n\nRecipie - (Serves 4)\n\nIngredients :\n1cup milk\n1cup cream\n3tbsp sugar\n1tsp gelatin\n4-5tbsp pineapple pulp\n1tsp vanilla essence\n\nHow to make a panna cotta ?\n\n1. Add 2tsp gelatin in 2tbsp water. Mix and keep it aside for 10min.\n2. Pour milk and cream into a saucepan and mix the sugar along, until it's dissolved.\nSet the saucepan over low heat and warm the milk gently, stirring or whisking frequently.\nDO NOT BOIL ! ❌\n2. Once the sugar has dissolved, add vanilla essence and the flavour. Stir this mixture.\n3. Add the gelatin to the saucepan and stir until the gelatin is dissolved.\n4. Strain the mixture and pour it into your ramekins.\n5. Keep the ramekins in normal temperature for 30min and then refrigerate for 5-hours or overnight.( Tip : The longer,the better ) 😉\n6. Run a thin knife carefully around the sides of a ramekin. Dip the ramekin in the warm water up to its rim, and hold it there for about 3 seconds.\nInvert the ramekin over the plate and shake gently to help it fall out. \n\nAnd Ta-Da, your panna-cotta is ready to be served ! 🤗\n\n#pannacotta #pineaplleflavoured #dessert #dessertsofinstagram #vegandesserts #homemade #lockdowndiaries #lockdowncooking #happiness #lovefordessertmaking #food #foodporn","NumberOfLikes":79,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1598289384,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 24 19:16:24 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Lockdown Diaries! \nThis exhibition brought back many memories of last few months.

I have always been an isolated artiste, who enjoys the conversation with the world of non-humans. Odissi heightened my ability to connect with all the energies around me, be it the wind, birds or trees. I started to enjoy them more than the company of people and there were some powerful conversations that started with them.\nIn college as well, as a painter, I liked to paint the life of a pigeon, rows of daals queued up in the kitchen, the solitary handpump in the park. I think the life of the supposedly unimportant, and inanimate appealed to me always.\nI have been writing my dance thoughts more, seeing my thoughts more clearly. I re-visualized some of my dance-poems around the house. In a new setting, 'the home', that I experience so richly.  and constant dance events. SLOW, is my natural pace, and the drop of life's pace in the lockdown has simply echoed my mind. It has felt beautifully in sync with myself.\nLack of performance has not worried me, as performance is built upon the solid base of abhyaas and reflection. That's what I get to build in 2020. And in terms of dance teaching, I switched immediately to zoom classes, so my students have continued with our progress this year.\nI have been writing my dance thoughts more, seeing my thoughts more clearly. I re-visualised some of my dance-poems around the house. In a new setting, 'the home', that I experience so richly. \n\n@jayamehtadance is a multi-media artist, Odissi dancer, poet, writer & teacher. She dances the Odissi style of Guru Surendra Nath Jena, imbibed from her Guru Pratibha Jena Singh.
