Then horror which we used to read in past came in reality for this generation... Pandemic. \nLockdown was imposed in short interval notice and in a snap sound of fingers, many found themselves jobless, trapped inside. Privileged as me just had to get ourselves keep confined to our spaces. Real struggle was for them whose life started daily with sunrise and bread earned by long day hard work. Now there was no work.\nAs a photographers' perspective, shoots got cancelled, project delayed or denied. After a few days of not shooting, we started searching way to pursue passion. Business meetings started on conference video calls. Few photographers came with a temporary solution of shooting on video calls. Facetime shoots, WhatsApp Call shoots, Google video shoots, Skype shoot came in existence... in a shell, Virtual Shoots. Ofcourse not good as actual shoot, but \"...dil ko khush rakhne ko ghalib ye khayal achchha hai...\", it became a trend amongst photographers.\nAfter initial denial, me too thought to give it a try. Talked to few people connected with me. Now I am sharing few results. \nI won't call myself as Photographer for these shots, just a director. \n--- \u2022\u2022\u2022 ---\nIn picture: @dikshadesire\n--- \u2022\u2022\u2022 ---\n#virtual #shoot #virtualshoot #facetime #facetimephotoshoot #whatsapp #videocall #portrait_vision #pictureoftheday #photooftheday #pursuitofportraits #portrait_today #portrait_mood #portraitphotography #portrait_shots #portraiture #mood #moodygrams #snapseed #lockdowndiaries #lockdown #coronatime #portraitvision_ #pr0ject_uno #pr0ject_soul #portraitphotographer #couch #red #relax #relaxing","NumberOfLikes":38,"Hashtags":["#virtual","#shoot","#virtualshoot","#facetime","#facetimephotoshoot","#whatsapp","#videocall","#portrait_vision","#pictureoftheday","#photooftheday","#pursuitofportraits","#portrait_today","#portrait_mood","#portraitphotography","#portrait_shots","#portraiture","#mood","#moodygrams","#snapseed","#lockdowndiaries","#lockdown","#coronatime","#portraitvision_","#pr0ject_uno","#pr0ject_soul","#portraitphotographer","#couch","#red","#relax","#relaxing"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598110660,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 17:37:40 CEST 2020","Location":"India"},{"CaptionText":"Homemade takeaways...\n#Saturdays \n#Supper \n#homemade \n#gatsbyroll \n#viennaandchipsgatsby\n#CapeTown \n#lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":13,"Hashtags":["#Saturdays","#Supper","#homemade","#gatsbyroll","#viennaandchipsgatsby","#CapeTown","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598110600,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 17:36:40 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Everyone asked me if i got bored in the lockdown and I said \u201Cno I\u2019ve got tips to waste my time\u201D So here I bring to you a few insights from how I passed my lockdown and learn how to waste sometime🤣🤓\n\nFor a quick overview about the tips- see the highlights!!\n\nAnd stay tuned for more stupid content😜\n\n#lockdown2020 #lockdownlife #lockdowndiaries #timepass #passtime #instadaily #socialmedia #boredinthehouse #explorepage #killingboredom\n@_simmba._","NumberOfLikes":83,"Hashtags":["#lockdown2020","#lockdownlife","#lockdowndiaries","#timepass","#passtime","#instadaily","#socialmedia","#boredinthehouse","#explorepage","#killingboredom"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":9,"Timestamp":1598110521,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 17:35:21 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"গৃহবন্দি🙆🙆\nMe-@ananya_karmakar_💜\n#lockdown #lockdown2020 #lockdown #lockdowndiaries","NumberOfLikes":381,"Hashtags":["#lockdown","#lockdown2020","#lockdown","#lockdowndiaries"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by অনন্যা কর্মকার in Devi Bari, Cooch Behar with @sunshine_of_april_, @priya_sharma155, @bongcrush.in, @meera_solanki_001, @bongosundori, @meera_solanki_15, and @priya_thakur_123.
