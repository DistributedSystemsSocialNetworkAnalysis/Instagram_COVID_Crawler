It has been a year 'where what is important' has been snapped into focus.\n\nSocial media, in conjunction with the news, has shown the world- the best and the worst (so far) of the human race....and the year is not yet over. 124 more days to go!\n\n...and then what? I mean, I too have said, \"I'm sooooo done with 2020. The year can END NOW!\" But let's be real here...we are still going to be dealing with this pandemic and its effects long into 2021, possibly 2022- depending on how the world's economy bounces back. \n\nI'm not trying to be pessimistic here. I'm just saying you can't WILL this away... Clearly there are lessons that we need to learn here. However-what lessons you take from this pandemic is up to you.\n\nHow you react is up to you!\n\nOne of the things I learned is that I am a much bigger \"people person\" than I thought and I didn't realize just how much until I couldn't socialize anymore. \n\nI've had days where I was frustrated, scared, and angry. That is to be expected. There are days when I still get utterly depressed because, while I'm greatful to have a job to now go back to, it's so different from what it use to be. \n\nThe best advice I can give is to acknowledge all of what you are feeling. Every emotion! Let it all out! It will be cathartic....and then find some joy. \n\nWhich brings me to my very longwinded point to this post- I have bad days and I'm sure you all do too. But I challenge you to find something each and every day that makes you happy- regardless of how small it is- and post it. \n\nThere are 124 days left until 2021 so why don't we make them 124 days of #millionsofmomentsofhappiness\n\nWho's with me?\n\n#covid19 #pandemic #humanity #emotions #feelings #anger #frustration #scared #extrovert #peopleperson #socialize #findthejoy","NumberOfLikes":0,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Christy Pagé on August 30, 2020.

Many of my clients when we have our check in calls have been speaking about how, even the ones who are extremely introverted, are really feeling the pandemic restrictions right now.\n\nAnother huge topic within my friend and client groups has been the energy of change. Of feeling this vast opening and awareness to step into something bigger and better for themselves.\n\nThis card is about not allowing this chance to pass you by. What is the difference between isolation and solitude? Where are you hiding, making excuses, over or under preparing? It's time to step into your role and accept your amazingness.***\n\nReverse table top and bridge poses can help with your throat chakra. \nAre you ready to join me with my new Chakra Yoga Series?\n\nImbalances - whether overactive or underactive - in the throat chakra can show up as sore throats, tight jaws, stiff neck, and headaches. You might feel a want to go for your dreams and come up with any reason not to start. Have you been experiencing any of these?\n\nComment below what you are experiencing, what you are doing, and whether this post resonates with you. \n\nIf you'd like some help, get a clearing of your throat chakra to be ready to take action for $5. Comes with a report about the state of your throat chakra.\n\nGet a reading with guidance just like this as well as personal channeled messages for $7.77 and add a healing to the Chakra that comes up for you in your reading for a total of $11.11 at the3gates.com\/ig.\n\nNew Charka Series program is in the works and it's going to be bomb!

Are you the same person you were back in March? Are you ready to face the outside world? @malavikavaradan takes a walk through these questions and other\u2019s in this weeks WKND special : Back to school in a different normal. Here is an excerpt!\n\n***\nIf you had told me in February that I would soon have six months of staying home, working remotely and accessing some of the greatest resources in the world, I would have started making a list. February Malavika would have told you that September Malavika would be a Spanish expert who could play the guitar, had successfully completed 10 Harvard online courses and read every single book on her shelf. Instead, I sit here congratulating myself on not having gone completely insane.\n\nSchools are opening next week, and traditionally, in Dubai, this is marked as the week when malls are full, traffic jams begin to worsen and spending is at its peak. It's when we 'return' to work after our long weekends and summer breaks - with photo albums from holidays and stories to share. But this September, everything will be different.\n\nI sense an anxiety in the air, not just about health concerns, but also about who we are and what we have become over these months. We aren't the same people we were when schools closed in mid-March. Our realities are different. While some of us would do anything to return to 'normalcy', many others are standing at the door, hesitant about saying that we simply don't feel like we want to be out again.\n\nI look back at the calendar. It is, in fact, going to be September soon. Nothing any of us do can add hours to the clock. Or take days away. We may not be the people we were in March, but the world is not the same place either.\n\n***\n#covid #covid19 #corona #coronavirus #pandemic #virus #newnormal #stayhome #athome #backtoschool #backtonormal #stepout #productivity #mentalhealth #calm #stress #anxiety #health #healthy #september #august #2020 #thisyear #KTWKND","NumberOfLikes":7,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by WKND on August 29, 2020 tagging @dubaifashionblog, @oftravelsandtales_, @mom_in_dubai, @ishitaunblogged, @malavikavaradan, @pinkasfourablog, @mak.uaeblogger, @scribblesandclicks, @raisingmyknights, @blogitup.dxb, @mommyzdiaries, @rashidablogs, @allaboutmommyandzayed, @karuna.l, @taqato, @thepalm.life, @mimz.blog, @3_at_thirty, and @mom.in.progress.dxb.

We try to do variety of indoor activities at home but it\u2019s not my cup of tea and not consistent always. Personally I love outdoor play with my kids and it\u2019s really sad and disappointing not to take them out much. I have had limited SCREEN time for them before lockdown but it\u2019s difficult now. However, one routine activity we do daily is our bedtime reading. And since lockdown we have started another bedtime routine which is filling each other\u2019s bucket by sharing something each of us did for others that made us happy.  This is a difficult time for everyone and it\u2019s important not to compare your life with others.

I\u2019m talking obesity, ischemic heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer disease, COPD.\n.\nWhat triggers insulin resistance, you ask? The main drivers are chronic stress and stress hormones, SUGAR, and alcohol. But let\u2019s focus on stress for today.\n.\nSee, the way it works is like this:\nYou see a fearful event (like a fake pandemic made worse by incompetent politicians and disgraceful media). The fear then triggers the hyperactivity of the HPA (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal) axis which stimulates the release of cortisol from the adrenal glands. At the same time hyperglycaemia (increased glucose in the blood) is induced and insulin is released to control this hyperglycaemia by directing the glucose to enter cells (muscle, fat etc.) and reduce the amount in the blood. Over time, chronic stimulation of this process renders the cells non-responsive to insulin because they can't keep up and the glucose remains in the blood and more insulin is released but to no effect \u2013 a vicious cycle. The end result being your cells not responding to insulin - insulin resistance. \n.\nThis weakens your immune system and renders you more susceptible to inflammation, oxidative stress and manifestation of non-communicable diseases. \n.\nOf course, this is a very simplified version of the process, but you get the picture. This is why exercise and meditation are SO important. They regulate the hyperactivity of the HPA-axis and reduce the stress hormones.\n.\nOver the next few days I will also discuss how sugar and alcohol also contribute to this insulin resistance and how to best reduce\/eliminate it naturally.\n.\nFor more information, please feel free to send me a DM or drop a comment below ⬇️.\n.\nAs always, stay safe and stay healthy 🙂","NumberOfLikes":20,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @_naturalnutrition on August 29, 2020.

From the intricately decorated elephants to the wild Pulikali dancers, and from the gigantic snake boats lined up at the shore to the gorgeous floral decorations, this festival paints the state in more colors than one can imagine - on every OTHER year! In 2020 - however - the real story is far more different than the picture I just painted. There are no colourful rallies on the streets of Kerala, no folk dance performances, no large gatherings of hundreds - localites and tourists alike - to enjoy the procession, marking the onset of 10-day Onam celebrations this year. We may not see the usual fervour of floral rangolis, traditional dance and music programmes or the elaborate banana plantain feasts by Malayalis (in and outside Kerala) but the gala and gaiety still fills the hearts of people. With temples yet to open their doors, the people have shifted the rituals within their own doors, because - life must go on - and what better way to live than to spread a little festive cheer?\n\n#kerala #southindia #india #indiagram #festival #festivities #festivalsofindia #pandemic #celebrations #unityindiversity","NumberOfLikes":6564,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Suta on August 29, 2020.","NumberOfComments":25,"Timestamp":1598762082,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 30 06:34:42 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Kondangan heula.. \n#pandemic\n#covid_19","NumberOfLikes":3,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Arie Wibowo on August 29, 2020.

Вирусолог утверждает, что тянуть с массовым распространением препарата недопустимо, потому что без вакцинации люди будут продолжать заражаться коронавирусом и умирать.

Tak lama lagi, dia akan pergi dari rumah, memperjuangkan kehidupan yang dia cita-citakan. Itu berarti kami akan jarang bertemu. Hanya doa dan mimpi yang bisa menghubungkan.\n\nMeskipun aktivitasnya selama pandemi banyak dia habiskan mendaki gunung-gunung, mengajaknya melihat dari dekat tumbuhan nanas, tentu sesuatu yang berbeda. Tak bisa berbuah di dataran rendah, tapi juga tak bisa produktif di puncak ketinggian. Punggung gunung hingga lembah berpasir amat baik untuk hidup dan berbuah. Ananas Comosus, tanaman tropis yang berasal dari Paraguay, Brasil, dan Bolivia. Rumpun bahasa Inggris menyebutnya pineapple. Sebagian besar tanah di Nusantara amat cocok menjadi lahan produktivitas nanas.\n\nManfaatnya banyak sekali buat kesehatan tubuh manusia. Mulai dari membantu proses pencernaan, detoksifikasi racun, menguatkan imunitas, hingga menambah nutrisi. Artikel yang mengulasnya, tersebar luas di berbagai jurnal kesehatan.\n\nTuas gas Bajaj Chetak yang kami kendarai perlahan saya putar lagi. Sengaja saya menjadi pilot scooter Hindustan agar dia punya kesempatan banyak menikmati perjalanan. Nanas yang tumbuh di ladang dan halaman rumah-rumah warga, adalah buku yang wajib dia baca tanpa tanda baca. 🙏\n\nTabik,\n\n(DUM: Kediri Selatan, Minggu 30 Agustus 2020 siang)\n\n#rondaliterasi #nanas #ananascomosus #tropis #paraguay #brazil #bolivia #lembah #gunungkelud #datarantinggi #sulung #scooter #bajaj #bajajchetak #bajajchetak150 #hindustanscooter #indianscooter #scooterindia #jalanjalandangembira #bawahpohonmertega #bukutanpatandabaca #weekend #coronavirus #covid_19 #physicaldistancing #masker #pandemi #pandemic #humanikosilangit","NumberOfLikes":69,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Dwidjo U.

The differences are pretty amazing, I actually eat more than i used to 6 months ago but the type of training has actually utilized the diet more. I assume that my training plan has increased M.P.S (muscle protein synthesis) which probably caused me to retain most of my muscle while losing the body fat or else I would've lost alot of the muscle mass along with the fat. The right side is also the result of training for only an hour as that is the only time that you get during the pandemic.

There was a time when the monsoons failed to show up for many years and the Maharaja realised that his little children didn\u2019t even know what a rain cloud looked like, since they had never even seen one!! The courtiers came up with a novel idea whereby the ceilings were painted with images of rain bearing clouds. They also installed a small fountain there which would send water trickling down to imitate rainfall... 🌧\n\nOriginally named as Chintamani Mahal, it was later called Junagarh Fort (Old Fort) after the Royal Family moved out in 1902 to the newly built Lalgarh Palace. The sprawling fortress made of red sandstone was inaugurated in 1594 by Raja Rai Singh, the sixth ruler of Bikaner. Each succeeding ruler since then has left their own unique mark on this structure, resulting in an outstanding merger of different styles.\n\nNot only the little princes & princesses but the Maharaja too sought refuge in the Badal Mahal - to get relief from the heat of Rajasthan and also the pressures of running a Kingdom...\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n#palaceday #indianpalaceday #rajasthan #bikaner #india #junagarhfort #lockdown #pandemic #historichouse #architecture #monsoon #rains #bluesky #clouds #travel #muralart #paintedceiling #rajput #historicallandmark #curious #banna #smile #rathore #candid #instagood #flashback #memories #happytimes #socialdistancing #corona","NumberOfLikes":671,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by AR 🇮🇳🇳🇵🇬🇧 in Bikaner with @palaceday, @europeanroyalpalaces, and @chh_india.

How + when did this happen...??\n\u2022\nI guess probably while I was busy working my life away... Working day in + day out as part of our country\u2019s covid response 🇨🇦. These last few months have been filled with waking up, coffee, work, coffee, home, sleep + repeat. It\u2019s been A LOT. And at times, a little ridiculous.

And there are a lot of things I miss about it. I miss my unit + my colleagues - a lot. Hospital life has been my norm for the past almost 5 years. It\u2019s what I know. It\u2019s comfortable in a way.\n\u2022\nBut, being part of Canada\u2019s front line response to the pandemic - has been a learning experience in itself.

I will be the first to tell you that nursing can take you ANYWHERE.\n\u2022\nWho knew at this point in my career, this is where I would be. I question it sometimes, but I never regret it. How can you regret anything that teaches you something + introduces you to wonderful people?\n\u2022\nNursing school very much prepares you for the acute setting. But guess what? That\u2019s not going anywhere. Don\u2019t be afraid to take risks + experience other sides of nursing.

My hope is that if you\u2019re reading this, you\u2019re weathering the storm that is 2020. So much sadness for the state of our world, but we\u2019re at the rudder. We\u2019ve only ourselves to blame. Perhaps it\u2019s the elevation of self over others. Perhaps it\u2019s the lacking in love for our neighbors and our communities. Maybe it\u2019s the eschewing of personal responsibility. I don\u2019t know, but I worry about the mess we\u2019re leaving generations after. I once read about a culture in which elders planted fig trees that they knew they\u2019d never taste the fruit of. Planning that fruit to be harvested by their grand children. I think maybe what we\u2019ve lost most is the responsibility of our actions and how those actions echo resoundingly to the generations that come after us.#2020musings #werenottoofargone #pandemic","NumberOfLikes":27,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by James Conlin on August 29, 2020.

This time the FDA is reportedly warning consumers to be on the alert for alcohol-based hand sanitizer that is packaged in food and drink containers.\n\nAmong the food containers in which hand sanitizer is packaged are: children's food pouches, beer cans, and water, juice and vodka bottles. \n\nHand sanitizers containing food flavours like chocolate or raspberry have also been discovered.\n\nStating his increasing concern, FDA Commissioner Dr Stephen M. Hahn, said it's \"dangerous\" to add food-scented flavours to hand sanitizers, stating that could mislead children into thinking that the sanitizers are actually food.\n\nIn the warning the FDA said it has received reports of hand sanitizer being found in a water bottle and a hand sanitizer product marketed with cartoons for children that was in a pouch that looked like a snack.\n\nThe FDA added that it has seen an \"increasing number of adverse events with hand sanitizer ingestion, including cardiac effects, effects on the central nervous system, hospitalizations, and  death.\"\n\n#sanitizer #covid #handsanitizer #coronavirus #corona #staysafe #stayhome #mask #virus #sanitize #washyourhands #quarantine #clean #lockdown #socialdistancing #stayathome #disinfectant #sanitizers #skincare #health #antibacterial #facemask #stayhealthy #masker #sanitizermurah #pandemic #sanitizerspray #handwash #masks \n\nAD: Visit www.coolmarket.com- Jamaica's #1 Buyer & Seller Online Store\n\nAD: DM @myjamaicatoday for managing your Business Social Media Services.

With plenty of support from my family, I went from a \u201Cone man band\u201D with some stock in a garage covering small events in the first year of trading to a large premises, a team of staff, multiple vehicles and covering large lavish events accross the UK. \n\nEvery year, brides and grooms contact us upto 18 months in advance of their wedding to get their dates booked in with us. Just the same, over the last 18 months we have seen hundreds of brides and grooms choosing to get married in the year 2020 and especially on this bank holiday weekend, however the bitter truth is that COVID-19 had other plans.\n\nJust as it is every year, the bank holiday in August is always the busiest day of the year within the wedding industry.\n\nThis year was supposed to have been one of our busiest years since the business began, however the harsh reality and facts are as above that this multi billion pound industry that we contribute to has been massively affected in the UK yet hasn\u2019t been mentioned so much. This is something we really need to raise awareness of.  So many event decorators, venues, caterers, stylists, deejays etc have had to suffer during these times as many others. \n\nI\u2019m thankful to other companies that have reached out to support and to our clients that decided to keep their booking with us and new clients that have decided to book us for their smaller events. \n\nI\u2019m so grateful that the same passion and the drive remains within me and I\u2019m persistent that we\u2019ll make it through this to design many more weddings in years to come! Better times will arrive and we\u2019ll celebrate again. \n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n#Whataboutweddings #Pandemic #Covid19 #Business #Supportyourlocal #Ukgovt #WeddingDecor #AsianWeddings #IndianWedding #BritishWedding #Florist #Decor #Stylist #Businessesincovid #Gratitude","NumberOfLikes":56,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1598743647,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 30 01:27:27 CEST 2020","Location":"VerMillion Event Specialists"},{"CaptionText":"@anak_akhir_zaman77_palestina #ISLAMOPHOBIA ©\n\n.\nKerusuhan pecah di Kota Malmo, Swedia selatan, pada Jumat (28\/8) malam.

La constante campaña de odio contra CFK ha convertido en monigotes del horror a sus publicistas ya que algunos son  víctimas del virus del Covid que siembra enfermedad, incertidudumbre y muerte en el mundo. Pero hay algo peor: qué tuvo que haber pasado en esta sociedad para que un niño envuelto en una bandera argentina se haya convertido en un monstruo humano discriminando a una mujer? La escalada del odio tiene un antecedente inmediato en la región: el golpe en Bolivia y la represión asesina del Ejército golpista que tuvo como meta asesinar a Evo y no lo logró. Este fenómeno proscribió a Rafael Correa en Ecuador y a Lula en Brasil. Está hecho de la más clásica operación psicológica de masas realizada por terminales de la inteligencia estadounidense y sus socios locales. Con la pandemia emergen los mejores y peores sentimientos humanos. La extrema derecha anhela miles de muertos y el desgaste del gobierno que asumió hace casi 9 meses tras el saqueo macrista.

It's a good one for learning WHY & HOW #obesity makes COVID-19 infections much worse. Link in bio. 🙏\n.\n.\n\n.\n\"In this episode, Dr. Erin Stair chats with Dr. Rami Nakeshbandi and Rohan Maini about their research and the paper they recently published in the International Journal of Obesity, The Impact of Obesity on COVID-19 Complications: A Retrospective Cohort Study. The CDC and other health organizations have unequivocally stated that obesity is a significant risk factor for increased severity of COVID-19 infections and clinical outcomes. While it's well established that obesity is a significant risk factor for numerous health problems, Dr. Nakeshbandi and Rohan Maini will discuss the results of their research, particularly differences noted between men and women, ages, fat deposition, what outcomes were significantly impacted, and, perhaps most interestingly, why and how obesity impacts COVID-19 and its link to inflammation. They also use their sample population to elaborate on the causes of obesity and what we can do to prevent or slow down the USA's rising obesity rates.\nDr. Nakeshbandi is the Interim Chief Medical Officer at Suny Downstate Medical Center and the Chief Quality Officer.

It\u2019s the \u201CSwedish model\u201D, where children spend their time in nature, walk on trees and wade in mud. \u201CThe first three days together at home were pretty quiet\u201D says Lucia \u201Cbut Jeremi began to miss the woods soon. He was climbing into all the trees and bushes in the city on the way to a shop, much to the disapproval of passersby.\u201D\nLucia doesn't have an existential fear, but she is afraid for her mother and her elderly patients. \u201CThere has been a gigantic change with this pandemic\" she claims \"and if some thinks it's over and can be forgotten, they are being deluded\u201D.\n\n#motherandson\n#singlemother\n#matka\n#momandson #doctors #psychiatry #psychiatria #fotografiadokumentalna #documentaryphotography #pandemic #stayhome #homesweethome #dom #home #safety #vogue #fashion2020 #styleinspiration #cosmic #astronaut #child #pandemicstories #warsawpoland #medic #pets #catlover #portraitphotography #womanpower #lekarze #medyk","NumberOfLikes":28,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Grzegorz Klatka on August 29, 2020.

It\u2019s affected people\u2019s mental health and wellbeing by not being able to have their weekly therapy like I do as it was put on hold for a while. One minute we are living our everyday lives, going to work or going to college then the next thing we are limited to what we can do and who we can see.\n\nBut what can we do to reduce these restrictions and keep ourselves safe? Here are a few tips and tricks on how to do so:\n- Wash your hands regularly or even carry hand sanitiser around with you.\n\n- When you cough or sneeze make sure to cover your nose and mouth with your sleeve\/tissue and not your hands!\n\n- Do not share towels. I know that means more washing but it\u2019s better than putting yourself at risk!\n\n- Above all, wearing a mask is a top tip to stay safe!\n\nWhen I go out to help my gran with her shopping I always bring hand wipes just to wipe down the trolley from previous customers.
