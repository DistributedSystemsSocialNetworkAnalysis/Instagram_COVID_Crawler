Ships from New Jersey, USA\n \nAll masks feature (white or grey) polypropylene fabric on the inside acting as a physical filter, trapping incoming and outgoing droplets since the material holds an electrostatic charge in the humidity created when you breathe.\n \nWhile polypropylene fabric can act as a partial filter, the combination with the textile exterior can help reduce particles coming in and out of the mask.\n \n(Masks help reduce the risk of infection but should not be viewed as replacement for physical distancing of at least 6 feet from others, frequent hand-washing and avoiding large crowds. When combining masks with those measures, they make a big difference).\n \nMasks are fully washable and they will not fade or shrink. (We recommend washing by hand and hanging up to dry to avoid damage caused by some washing machines and\/or clothes dryers).\n \nAll designs are \"Limited Edition\" since these come from textiles hand made by talented weavers from Guatemala.

Do you fear getting sick? Are you concerned about your well being & your future? These are all symptoms of NOT dwelling in God. Always remember, divine peace is the absence of fear & the presence of God. Every problem you\u2019re facing today will be solved based on how much you dwell in the presence of God. Yes, that\u2019s significant! THE WORD 'DWELL' MEANS YOU HAVE TO ABIDE THERE ALL THE TIME. It denotes a fixed position, not something that occurs occasionally. Today, many people only 'visit' the Lord, and only when they\u2019re in trouble. Majority of their problems is because they aren\u2019t always dwelling in God\u2019s presence. The Bible says, IF you make the LORD your refuge, IF you make the Most High your shelter, no evil will conquer you; no plague will come near your home. For God will order his angels to protect you wherever you go (Psalm 91:9-11).\n\nNote, this verse does not say there won\u2019t be any evil or problems around us but God is promising His protection to everyone who will make God\u2019s presence his dwelling place. So, how can a person always dwell in God? You just need to do three things--Love God, Trust Him & Call upon God in the name of Jesus Christ (Psalm 91:14,15 & John 14:14). He longs for you to abide in Him and to see you prosper & succeed. Never wander away from His word, never stop trusting His promises & pray about every need you have. Look at all those blessings God does for those who dwell in Him : HE Covers, Shelters, Fights your battles, Protects, Delivers, Answers, HE is with you, Rescues & Honors you (Psalm 91). Yes, when you dwell in Him, the almighty God is promising to be with you every moment & HE will reward you with a fearless, healthy long life (Psalm 91:16). Amen.

How + when did this happen...??\n\u2022\nI guess probably while I was busy working my life away... Working day in + day out as part of our country\u2019s covid response üá®üá¶. These last few months have been filled with waking up, coffee, work, coffee, home, sleep + repeat. It\u2019s been A LOT. And at times, a little ridiculous. But I guess, when would a country\u2019s public health response during a pandemic not be ridiculous?\n\u2022\nI haven\u2019t worked in the hospital\/acute setting since May. And there are a lot of things I miss about it. I miss my unit + my colleagues - a lot. Hospital life has been my norm for the past almost 5 years. It\u2019s what I know. It\u2019s comfortable in a way.\n\u2022\nBut, being part of Canada\u2019s front line response to the pandemic - has been a learning experience in itself. The skills, experiences + most importantly to me, the friendships - are what I carry forward with me as I navigate this crazy world of nursing. I will be the first to tell you that nursing can take you ANYWHERE.\n\u2022\nWho knew at this point in my career, this is where I would be. I question it sometimes, but I never regret it. How can you regret anything that teaches you something + introduces you to wonderful people?\n\u2022\nNursing school very much prepares you for the acute setting. But guess what? That\u2019s not going anywhere. Don\u2019t be afraid to take risks + experience other sides of nursing. You never know where it will take you!\n\u2022\nWhen opportunities arise, I hope you welcome them with open arms‚ù§Ô∏è\n\u2022\nAnd PLEASE do better than I do. And rest and relax when you can.

My hope is that if you\u2019re reading this, you\u2019re weathering the storm that is 2020. So much sadness for the state of our world, but we\u2019re at the rudder. We\u2019ve only ourselves to blame. Perhaps it\u2019s the elevation of self over others. Perhaps it\u2019s the lacking in love for our neighbors and our communities. Maybe it\u2019s the eschewing of personal responsibility. I don\u2019t know, but I worry about the mess we\u2019re leaving generations after. I once read about a culture in which elders planted fig trees that they knew they\u2019d never taste the fruit of. Planning that fruit to be harvested by their grand children. I think maybe what we\u2019ve lost most is the responsibility of our actions and how those actions echo resoundingly to the generations that come after us.#2020musings #werenottoofargone #pandemic","NumberOfLikes":18,"Hashtags":["#2020musings","#werenottoofargone","#pandemic"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by James Conlin on August 29, 2020.

This time the FDA is reportedly warning consumers to be on the alert for alcohol-based hand sanitizer that is packaged in food and drink containers.\n\nAmong the food containers in which hand sanitizer is packaged are: children's food pouches, beer cans, and water, juice and vodka bottles. \n\nHand sanitizers containing food flavours like chocolate or raspberry have also been discovered.\n\nStating his increasing concern, FDA Commissioner Dr Stephen M. Hahn, said it's \"dangerous\" to add food-scented flavours to hand sanitizers, stating that could mislead children into thinking that the sanitizers are actually food.\n\nIn the warning the FDA said it has received reports of hand sanitizer being found in a water bottle and a hand sanitizer product marketed with cartoons for children that was in a pouch that looked like a snack.\n\nThe FDA added that it has seen an \"increasing number of adverse events with hand sanitizer ingestion, including cardiac effects, effects on the central nervous system, hospitalizations, and  death.\"\n\n#sanitizer #covid #handsanitizer #coronavirus #corona #staysafe #stayhome #mask #virus #sanitize #washyourhands #quarantine #clean #lockdown #socialdistancing #stayathome #disinfectant #sanitizers #skincare #health #antibacterial #facemask #stayhealthy #masker #sanitizermurah #pandemic #sanitizerspray #handwash #masks \n\nAD: Visit www.coolmarket.com- Jamaica's #1 Buyer & Seller Online Store\n\nAD: DM @myjamaicatoday for managing your Business Social Media Services.

Bagi Ibnu Hajar, orang yang berdiam di rumah selama wabah, sembari bersabar dan mengharap ridha Allah, ia akan memperoleh pahala seperti orang mati syahid meski dirinya tidak terkena wabah. Ia mengutip hadis Nabi, \u201CSesungguhnya kebanyakan para syuhada di kalangan umatku adalah orang-orang yang mati di atas kasur.\u201D\nPatut disebutkan di sini, tiga putri Ibnu Hajar wafat karena taun yang terjadi pada masa itu.

Whether your children are learning at home this year or heading back to school, this year will likely feel different for all of us. I\u2019ve teamed up with some other elementary educators to bring you some tips & tricks to ease the stress of back to school this year and feel more prepared!\u2063\n\u2063\nWhen teaching your children from home - especially the littles- you have to keep in mind how long their attentions spans are - how much \"instruction\" they can absorb at a given time. The \"luxury\" of teaching from home should be that learning can be based around your family life.\u2063\n\u2063\nüçé Create a home environment where learning can take place at any time of day\u2063 preventing the anxiety of a fixed schedule\n\u2063\nüçé For the young ones especially, remember that most of their learning comes from their environment, interactions with you and others, as well as their innate curiosity to explore the world around them\u2063\n\u2063\nüçé Remember that children tire from different activities faster than others - sometimes the gross motor activities exhaust their bodies while the fine motor may exhaust their minds\n\u2063\nüçé Use what you have! You do not need fancy curriculums or textbooks - engage in the everyday world around you, count things, sort things, read things, eat play and explore things...take breaks and then get back at it\u2063\n\u2063\nüçé Make it fun...for both of you!\u2063\n\u2063\nTo see more tips check out the pages below:\u2063\n@eat_play_read\u2063\n@asunnydayinfirstgrade\u2063\n@ureadyteddy\u2063\n@teachtalkinspire\u2063\n@mamainthegalaxy\u2063\n@stayathomeactivitymom\u2063\n\u2063\nHappy Back to School! üçé","NumberOfLikes":148,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":22,"Timestamp":1597244319,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 12 16:58:39 CEST 2020","Location":"New Orleans, Louisiana"},{"CaptionText":"Part 3)2parts)üé•üéô )Peoples Army studio session..pure Good vibes üôèüèæ G izangggg üíØüñ§üó£ Guiding A New Generation üôèüèæ G izangggg üö® G.A.N.Güó£Guiding a new generation ‚úäüèæ #ukmusic #music #pandemic #positivevibes #rap #london #hiphop #acapella #ukhiphop #rapper #peoplesarmy #guidinganewgeneration #staysafe #openmic #90s #session #musiclife #stayhome #positivity #goodvibes #fun #singer #freestyle #freestylerap #live #lifelessons #barz #studio #raw #uncut","NumberOfLikes":126,"Hashtags":["#ukmusic","#music","#pandemic","#positivevibes","#rap","#london","#hiphop","#acapella","#ukhiphop","#rapper","#peoplesarmy","#guidinganewgeneration","#staysafe","#openmic","#90s","#session","#musiclife","#stayhome","#positivity","#goodvibes","#fun","#singer","#freestyle","#freestylerap","#live","#lifelessons","#barz","#studio","#raw","#uncut"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":15,"Timestamp":1593070284,"LocalDate":"Thu Jun 25 09:31:24 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"üéºüé∏ü™ïüé∫üé∑‚ù§Ô∏èüíõüíö üó£Guiding a new generation üíØüñ§ #rastalove #music #ukrap #ukdrillmusic #rap #london #chiefkeef #rapper #popsmoke #headieone #bujubanton #coronavirus #goodenergy #freestyle #openmic t##musicvideo  #park #covid19 #redgoldgreen #trap#pandemic #roots #drill#singer #offthetop #jamaica #freestylerap #freestyles","NumberOfLikes":64,"Hashtags":["#rastalove","#music","#ukrap","#ukdrillmusic","#rap","#london","#chiefkeef","#rapper","#popsmoke","#headieone","#bujubanton","#coronavirus","#goodenergy","#freestyle","#openmic","#musicvideo","#park","#covid19","#redgoldgreen","#tra","#pandemic","#roots","#dril","#singer","#offthetop","#jamaica","#freestylerap","#freestyles"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":8,"Timestamp":1592903149,"LocalDate":"Tue Jun 23 11:05:49 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Part 2-2parts)üé•üéô )Peoples Army studio session..pure Good vibes üôèüèæ G izangggg üíØüñ§üó£ Guiding A New Generation üôèüèæ G izangggg üö® G.A.N.Güó£Guiding a new generation ‚úäüèæ #ukmusic #music #pandemic #positivevibes #rap #london #hiphop #piano #ukhiphop #rapper #peoplesarmy #guidinganewgeneration #staysafe #openmic #90s #session #musiclife #stayhome #positivity #goodvibes #fun #singer #freestyle #freestylerap #live #lifelessons #barz #studio #raw #uncut","NumberOfLikes":133,"Hashtags":["#ukmusic","#music","#pandemic","#positivevibes","#rap","#london","#hiphop","#piano","#ukhiphop","#rapper","#peoplesarmy","#guidinganewgeneration","#staysafe","#openmic","#90s","#session","#musiclife","#stayhome","#positivity","#goodvibes","#fun","#singer","#freestyle","#freestylerap","#live","#lifelessons","#barz","#studio","#raw","#uncut"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":15,"Timestamp":1592809649,"LocalDate":"Mon Jun 22 09:07:29 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Semangat Pagi Bidan Indonesia!\n\n_WEBINAR KEBIDANAN_\n*Manajemen Laktasi di masa Adaptasi Kebiasaan Baru*\n\nüóìÔ∏è Minggu, 6 September 2020\nüï∞Ô∏è 08.00 s.d selesai\nüéÄ Sertifikat 2 SKP IBI\n\n_Kontribusi 65.000_\n\nKirimkan *Nama Lengkap\/Gelar\/alamat email\/no HP*  via WhatsApp ke nomor 089520056666 untuk mendaftar.Mendaftar secara kolektif 10 peserta get 1 seat gratis,  berlaku kelipatan.\n\ncc: @cardia.eo \n\n#webinarkesehatan #webinarkebidanan #webinar #bidanindonesia #kebidanan #mahasiswakebidanan #tenagakesehatan #tenagamedisindonesia #bidanparody #laktasi #coronavirus #pandemic #karantina #indonesiawebinar","NumberOfLikes":169,"Hashtags":["#webinarkesehatan","#webinarkebidanan","#webinar","#bidanindonesia","#kebidanan","#mahasiswakebidanan","#tenagakesehatan","#tenagamedisindonesia","#bidanparody","#laktasi","#coronavirus","#pandemic","#karantina","#indonesiawebinar"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by BIDAN PARODY üíâüíäüè• on August 29, 2020 tagging @cardia.eo.

By that measure the U.S. is slipping dangerously.\n\nRomance is on the wane. A Pew survey from late 2019 found that 37% of single Americans aged 18-29 weren\u2019t looking for either long-term or casual relationships, with most saying they either had other priorities or just weren\u2019t interested.\n\nMeanwhile, plenty of evidence shows young Americans are having less sex than ever before, even in an age of permissive mores.\n\n\u201CThe internet was supposed to reverse these trends.

As life came to a standstill due to the pandemic, the street book sellers at Nilkhet had lost all hope of getting any income to survive the upcoming months. We, at Pashe Achi Initiative, couldn't just stand and watch that happen. So, we decide to buy books worth lakhs from 4-5 of these book sellers and sell them to the general public at 200tk each, no matter what size each book was. We had 3 goals in mind\n- help the Nilkhet book sellers\n- help the general public make the most of lockdown by engaging in an enriching activity\n- help the ones most affected by the Coronavirus crisis with the funds received from selling the books\n\nPeople are starting to frequent Nilkhet again. However, very few people come here to buy books. Even now, we go to every nook and cranny of the Nilkhet streets and search for any book seller we can help. A lot of them have now become financially viable because of Project Granthamangal. This project has also enabled us to help the poor and vulnerable with rehabilitation programs. Thus, we have decided to continue this initiative for as long as we can. \n\nYou can buy almost any book from us for just 200tk. \nNO DELIVERY CHARGE in Dhaka if you buy MINIMUM 2 BOOKS. \n60tk delivery charge if you buy only one book inside Dhaka. This is ONLY to cover minimum expenses associated with the project.\n\nDELIVERY CHARGE OUTSIDE DHAKA is 150tk.\nIf it was possible, we wouldn't have kept any delivery charge for even people from outside Dhaka.\n\nPlease note, only books from our book list are available for purchase:\n\nhttps:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/u\/0\/d\/1S_l6_E7Wv6geSfjkAQYQ2g7Rd4KTW33gX8PmDKTFc60\/htmlview#gid=186358925","NumberOfLikes":30,"Hashtags":["#gid=186358925"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598726444,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 29 20:40:44 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Voc√™ conhece algum invejoso?\nINCR√çVEL!\nO amor derruba a inveja!\n\n#inveja#lives#dilsinho#pandemic \n#loren#carisma#maisa\n#programadamaisa#praia \n#famososdainternet#musicaboa \n#cantorasertaneja\n#seguidores#sabado#cantorpopular#shoping#carinhosa\n#baton#mulheresempreendedoras \n#bomdemais#videosmusicais \n#beleza#mundomelhor \n#mulher#deusnocomando","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#invej","#live","#dilsinh","#pandemic","#lore","#carism","#maisa","#programadamais","#praia","#famososdainterne","#musicaboa","#cantorasertaneja","#seguidore","#sabad","#cantorpopula","#shopin","#carinhosa","#bato","#mulheresempreendedoras","#bomdemai","#videosmusicais","#belez","#mundomelhor","#mulhe","#deusnocomando"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598726423,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 29 20:40:23 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Checkout this hot & latest Dresses\nSolid Black Above Knee Cotton Dress \nOnly at Rs- 450\/- \n\nFabric: Cotton\n\nSleeves: Sleeves Are Included\n\nSize: S - 36 in, M - 38 in, L - 40 in\n\nLength: Front: Up To 34 in, Back: Up To 40 in \n\nType: Stitched\n\nDescription:  It Has 1 Piece Of Women's Dress\n\nPattern: Solid\nSizes Available - S, M, L\n\n‚óèFree shipping \n‚óèbest quality\n‚óèall size available\n‚óèno refund\n\n#fashion #style #love #dresses #collection #instagood #workout #pandemic #quarantinelife #memes #instagood  #makeuptutorial #trendy #outfits","NumberOfLikes":1,"Hashtags":["#fashion","#style","#love","#dresses","#collection","#instagood","#workout","#pandemic","#quarantinelife","#memes","#instagood","#makeuptutorial","#trendy","#outfits"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @thecloset266 on August 29, 2020.

Too busy and too tired. These phrases are the mantra of an American society that, according to the Institute of Medicine, has the dubious distinction of falling behind nearly every other affluent country in terms of life expectancy, rate of injury and illness, and overall health. The dismal figures regarding our health impact not just our happiness, but our financial bottom line. The pandemic threatens the mental and physical wellbeing of every American. People are seeking ways to manage their stress, but it isn\u2019t enough,\u201D said Wayne Jonas, MD, executive director of Samueli Integrative Health Programs. \u201CAs we adjust to a new normal, we need to foster a robust, patient-centered healthcare system to better promote self-care. More than one in four Americans report a lack of energy (30%), difficulty sleeping (29%), or exercising less (29%) during the pandemic. Nearly half of Americans (47%) report feeling socially isolated, according to the online survey of more than 2,000 adults over age 18 conducted in May 2020. In summarizing the importance of the findings, Jonas said, \u201CAs the country begins our recovery, it will inevitably create questions about the future of the healthcare system. The findings from this study show the critical need for a system that empowers individuals to maintain healthy habits they formed and emphasizes strategies that support self-care\u2014like good nutrition, exercising, and stress reduction\u2014alongside guidance from physicians.\u201D -@drwaynejonas \n#drwaynejonas #pandemic #selfcare #selfcaretips #optimalhealth #prevention #wellness #exercise #nutrition #fitness #mindfulness #stressmanagement #healthcare  #vitality #energy #america #unitedstates #makeamericahealthyagain","NumberOfLikes":2,"Hashtags":["#drwaynejonas","#pandemic","#selfcare","#selfcaretips","#optimalhealth","#prevention","#wellness","#exercise","#nutrition","#fitness","#mindfulness","#stressmanagement","#healthcare","#vitality","#energy","#america","#unitedstates","#makeamericahealthyagain"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by juliaelhaj ‚ù§Ô∏èüëÅ‚ôåÔ∏èüí™üèΩüßïüèº on August 29, 2020.

I know it\u2019s not only me. I see this in friends, family and in the constant dripping message from the media portraying a dark future. \n...\nAm I going to lose my job? Will my kids get infected when they return to school? Will my grandfather get ill? Will we ever find a vaccine?\n...\nAs human beings, thinking about the future is unavoidable. The human brain has this capacity and our mind is constantly coming back and forth from the present to the future. The problem is that most of the times we do this and we\u2019re not even aware of it. At the end of the day, you may have thought of a grim future more than a thousand times without realising it. But just because you can\u2019t see these thoughts happening at the background, doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t feel them: shortness of breath, tension in your head, stiff neck, feeling grumpy, withdrawing emotionally\u2026 The consequences of \u201Cliving\u201D in a dark future can be extremely painful, both physically and emotionally. \n...\nWhat\u2019s a great remedy to combat travelling to this hypothetical future? \n...\nùêÜùê´ùê®ùêÆùêßùêù ùê≤ùê®ùêÆùê´ùê¨ùêûùê•ùêü ùê¢ùêß ùê≠ùê°ùêû ùê©ùê´ùêûùê¨ùêûùêßùê≠ ùê¶ùê®ùê¶ùêûùêßùê≠, focus on the moment that\u2019s happening ùê´ùê¢ùê†ùê°ùê≠ ùêßùê®ùê∞, ùêöùêßùêù ùêßùê®ùê∞, ùêöùêßùêù ùêßùê®ùê∞, ùêöùêßùêù ùêßùê®ùê∞. I have never found a better way to do this than through mindfulness exercises. All it takes is practice, accountability (particularly in the beginning) and accepting that you (and nobody for the matter) can\u2019t control the future. All these aspects are trained and discussed in my mindfulness courses. \n...\nIf you want to know more, my next course begins in September.

I saw a chiropractor for the last 3 months and it helped me tremendously. I couldn\u2019t be more grateful! And now I feel ready for the semester coming to finally graduate no matter what. üéì \n\nBut the hardest thing was to be away from my parents. I was really hoping that somehow I could come home in February, but at the moment, even February seems impossible considering that my parents are both at corona risk. I would do anything to protect them. Even if it means not seeing them for so long...üòû\n\nI have been educated to never force an opinion on someone, and it isn\u2019t my purpose. All I ask for, is that many of you who are against wearing the mask just sit a moment and ask yourselves: is it really worth it, to be against it? Are you against it for yourself? Unless there is a relevant reason not to wear it, please ask yourselves if it\u2019s worth it. Because so far, the reasoning for every person who was against it was \u201CI don\u2019t want to wear the mask because I...\u201D or \u201CI am against it because I...\u201D. In this situation, it isn\u2019t our job to be selfish. It is our job to selfless and think of others, our environment, our families. The sooner we all start taking this new concept as valid, the sooner we will find a solution. \n\nI know that I am not the only one separated from my family. Therefore, we must learn to think of others before we think of ourselves. This is just what I had to share with you. This week has been a weird one, from my phone dying, to my computer slowly dying, to missing my parents and so on. Shostakovich\u2019s music is so healing to me, especially just the opening of this concerto...\n.\n.\n.\n#classicalmusic #100daysofpractice #covid19\n#violin #concerto #violinist #classical #music #pandemic #musician #austria #moÃàdling #spreadlove #staysafe","NumberOfLikes":620,"Hashtags":["#classicalmusic","#100daysofpractice","#covid19","#violin","#concerto","#violinist","#classical","#music","#pandemic","#musician","#austria","#moÃàdling","#spreadlove","#staysafe"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":24,"Timestamp":1598718232,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 29 18:23:52 CEST 2020","Location":"M√∂dling"},{"CaptionText":"\u201CQueen size bed sheet with two pillow covers\u201D\nHello üåç  #mgcollection11 #localmarket #cottonbedsheet #siliguricity #panindia #homedecor #homesweethome #cottonfabric #shoppingonline #supportsmallbusiness #ladyboss #readyforsummer #shoppingonline #pandemic #newbusiness #businesswoman #comfort #100 #localbusiness\n#onlineshopping #instagramshopping #onlineshoppers #instagramshoppingstore #shoponline #shoppersofinstagram","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#mgcollection11","#localmarket","#cottonbedsheet","#siliguricity","#panindia","#homedecor","#homesweethome","#cottonfabric","#shoppingonline","#supportsmallbusiness","#ladyboss","#readyforsummer","#shoppingonline","#pandemic","#newbusiness","#businesswoman","#comfort","#100","#localbusiness","#onlineshopping","#instagramshopping","#onlineshoppers","#instagramshoppingstore","#shoponline","#shoppersofinstagram"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by MGCollection in Siliguri.

This is likely more in line with their circadian rhythms and more evidence to #startschoollater. ü•≥\n‚òëÔ∏è Those who were 12-17 especially did well by improving their sleep quality and reducing daytime sleepiness. ü•≥\n‚òëÔ∏èThose who were older (18-25) didn't sleep quite as well. They had more difficulty falling asleep, increased awakenings, and more nightmares. This could be potentially related to more responsibilities and stressors.\n\nBottom line: there are many individual factors that influence how we sleep  during a pandemic. Finding ways that help YOU üí§ BETTER are important. \n\nHere is what I found to help me manage stress and sleep better:\n‚òëÔ∏è Moderate\/vigorous exercise outside in am for 45min every other day. With walking or yoga in between days\n‚òëÔ∏è Nature\n‚òëÔ∏èNon-alcoholic beer. I found üç∫ that tastes good without the detrimental impact on üí§. I feel like the ritual of having a beer (frosty mug required) helps me after a stressful day and I don't really miss the alcohol.\n‚òëÔ∏èI try to go for green tea üçµ after a poor night's sleep. Reason being, I want to be able to take a nap or fall asleep earlier that night. Even if I just drink a half caffeinated coffee, I find that I'm wired and makes it more difficult to stay focused and fall asleep easily.\n\nHow did you sleep during lock down?\n\n#covid_19\n#covid19 #pandemic #lockdown #stayathome  #sleep #sleeptips #sleepdeprived","NumberOfLikes":21,"Hashtags":["#SLEEP2020.","#startschoollater.","#covid_19","#covid19","#pandemic","#lockdown","#stayathome","#sleep","#sleeptips","#sleepdeprived"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Dr. Amy M.
