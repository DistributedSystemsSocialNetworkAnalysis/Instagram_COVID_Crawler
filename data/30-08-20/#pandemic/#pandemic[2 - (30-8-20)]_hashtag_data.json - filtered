He almost always reads him \u201CWish\u201D (our favorite) and one more.\n♥ After that I turn on his goodnight playlist. First song is \u201CThe scientist\u201D by Coldplay and we usually dance a little for a minute and then we walk over to the two globes he has in his room. He always reaches out to touch and scratch the globes. Then we go to the curtains that has stars on them and he always reaches out to touch the stars. I love this part ⭐️ \n♥  Then I feed him. \n♥  Sometimes he falls asleep while feeding and even though its the easiest way, I am trying to avoid it. Everything I read is that you need to teach baby to fall asleep on his own (not necessary alone but on his own). August falls asleep super easy while feeding or being rocked but lately I try to keep him awake and then put him down in his mini-crib by our bed.\n♥  This is where it gets challenging half of the time. Sometimes he falls asleep the second I put him down but if he is still very awake he will start rolling over, kicking etc. etc.\n♥  We either way play white noise, music or shh-sounds for him while waiting for him to fall asleep. \n♥  If he doesn\u2019t fall asleep within 20 minutes, we pick him up and rock him and he is usually out within a couple of minutes. I don\u2019t have the patience to wait longer than that when it looks like he is having a dance party and is not even close to sleeping. Rocking always works. \n♥  He usually falls asleep between 8:00 - 9:00 pm. By midnight I give him a dream feed (feeding him without waking him up) which is never a problem, he always keeps sleeping\n♥ He usually sleeps until 8:00 so between 10-12 hours depending on when he fell asleep.\n\nAugust is such a great sleeper, when he is asleep he will usually stay asleep. But what we are working on right now, is for him to fall asleep on his own. My favorite part is dancing and saying good night to the curtain stars and globes. 🥰\n\nWhat does your baby\u2019s bedtime routine look like?","NumberOfLikes":142,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by 𝚑𝚊𝚗𝚗𝚊 𝚠𝚊𝚝𝚜𝚘𝚗  | 𝚒𝚟𝚏 𝚖𝚊𝚖𝚊 in Calgary, Alberta.

Sometimes things collide in a way you can\u2019t see coming and the pain is deep. \n\nFrom the horrific incident involving Jacob Blake, the murder of two protestors & Covid-19 hitting my immediate family, I feel like the only thing I have to say to anyone lately is that it all feels so heavy.💔\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to get sucked into the abyss when there seems to be no time to catch your breath before being hit by yet another tragedy. \n\nShockwaves go through your body when you hear of the unexpected & private cancer battle that took the life of an actor, who was maybe more of a hero in real-life than the one he played on the big screen. And you\u2019re reminded once again that every space is not a safe one, after a brother in Christ calls you a racist sinner for daring to name the evil that is white supremacy.\n\nI am tired. I am weary. Doesn\u2019t anybody see? \n\nThen the cries of my heart are met with a still, soft whisper from the Lord gently asking, \u2018why are you still holding onto these things that you were never meant to carry?\u2019\n\nAs I sit with this thought, I lean into my feelings while processing what I truly need to surrender today. Some things and circumstances that I surely, was never in control of anyways. \n\nThis doesn\u2019t take away my lament & it doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s anything wrong with grieving, but everything is not ours to hold, & I\u2019ve had trouble making that distinction lately. \n\nSomething tells me I\u2019m not the only one, so I invite you to lay down your burdens with me. And if you\u2019re looking to shed that unnecessary weight off your shoulders, join me as I run straight into the arms of Jesus.\n\nFor there I will be weightless, and in the very best company. 🖤 @patricia_a_taylor \n\n\u201CAre you tired? Worn out? Burned out on religion? Come to me. Get away with me and you\u2019ll recover your life. I\u2019ll show you how to take a real rest. Walk with me and work with me\u2014watch how I do it.

Those on-trend (from Ed Sheeran to players on the L.A. Lakers) are instead blending their morning cup with a serving of butter.\n\nWhy? \"It makes for the creamiest, most satisfying cup of coffee you\u2019ve ever had,\" Dave Asprey writes on his website. He's the creator of Bulletproof Coffee, the small company credited for popularizing the concoction. The tech-investor attributes a high-fat diet to his 80-pound weight loss. And beyond taste, Asprey says this buttery drink provides all of the energizing benefits of a cup of coffee, without the four o'clock slump. Bulletproof believers insist that the butter's high-fat content will slow the time it takes for your body to metabolize the coffee's caffeine. In other words, increased energy, decreased crash.\n\n#hongkong #zoom #virus #blacklivesmatter #belarus #pandemic #protest #beach #socialdistancing #wtfmemes #lockdown #christian #tiktok #cat #corruption #covid19 # #propaganda #evangelical #obama #socialmedia #bailout #quarantine #trump #blm #pandemic #stimulus #testing #stayhome #trump2020 #bhfyp #election2020","NumberOfLikes":2,"Hashtags":["#hongkong","#zoom","#virus","#blacklivesmatter","#belarus","#pandemic","#protest","#beach","#socialdistancing","#wtfmemes","#lockdown","#christian","#tiktok","#cat","#corruption","#covid19","#propaganda","#evangelical","#obama","#socialmedia","#bailout","#quarantine","#trump","#blm","#pandemic","#stimulus","#testing","#stayhome","#trump2020","#bhfyp","#election2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598720512,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 29 19:01:52 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"kabbalah.info","CaptionText":"Everyone, from America\u2019s best friends to its worst enemies, wanted, and perhaps still want to realize the American Dream. And that dream is mainly about money and wealth. Bit by bit, America became the leader of the free world, where people were slaves only to the injunctions of their egos.\u2060\n\u2060\nBut that could only last so far. At some point, the ego exceeded its limits and began to collapse from within. The society that was built based on the ego could not withstand its increasingly self-centered demands and started to implode. When people began to give up on realizing their dreams, they sought ways to ease their painful disillusionment. Thus, America became a nation of fugitives escaping their own emptiness. Obesity, substance abuse, homicide, suicide, extremism, and any form escapism became more likely to take root there than anywhere else in the world. Simply, people needed to get away from their hopelessness.\u2060\n\u2060\nNature, too, of which America was so proud, and rightly so, seems to have joined the \u201Ctrend\u201D of bashing America and has been hammering the country on all sides. In its own way, it has said to its settlers, \u201CEnough!\u201D\u2060\n\u2060\nTimes are changing. The ego is losing steam and has lost its chokehold on the planet. Nature is kicking back, and humanity, the ego\u2019s personal thug, is hurting. But America, where the ego wrote the constitution, hurts the most.\u2060\n\u2060\nIn the times to come, mutual consideration will be mandatory, responsibility for one another will be a given, and ego-based cultures will collapse. We are living through a civilizational shift. It is a revolution of a kind we\u2019ve never seen. It is not a revolution in technology, governance, economics, or in all the above combined. It is a revolution in human nature. Humanity has entered a transformational stage from which it will emerge as a whole new creation: caring, considerate, and united as one.\u2060\n\u2060\nThose who will bury their pride will come out on top. Those who will stand by their egos will fall along with it.\u2060\n\u2060\nAmerica became great thanks to brave people who dared the odds. But it will remain great only if it dares to tame its own bravado. \u2060\n\u2060\n#americandream #nature \u2060\n\u2060","NumberOfLikes":58,"Hashtags":["#americandream","#nature"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Kabbalah.Info Bnei Baruch on August 29, 2020.

I know it\u2019s not only me. I see this in friends, family and in the constant dripping message from the media portraying a dark future. \n...\nAm I going to lose my job? Will my kids get infected when they return to school? Will my grandfather get ill? Will we ever find a vaccine?\n...\nAs human beings, thinking about the future is unavoidable. The human brain has this capacity and our mind is constantly coming back and forth from the present to the future. The problem is that most of the times we do this and we\u2019re not even aware of it. At the end of the day, you may have thought of a grim future more than a thousand times without realising it. But just because you can\u2019t see these thoughts happening at the background, doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t feel them: shortness of breath, tension in your head, stiff neck, feeling grumpy, withdrawing emotionally\u2026 The consequences of \u201Cliving\u201D in a dark future can be extremely painful, both physically and emotionally. \n...\nWhat\u2019s a great remedy to combat travelling to this hypothetical future? \n...\n𝐆𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐬𝐞𝐥𝐟 𝐢𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐦𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭, focus on the moment that\u2019s happening 𝐫𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭 𝐧𝐨𝐰, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐧𝐨𝐰, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐧𝐨𝐰, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐧𝐨𝐰.

All it takes is practice, accountability (particularly in the beginning) and accepting that you (and nobody for the matter) can\u2019t control the future. All these aspects are trained and discussed in my mindfulness courses. \n...\nIf you want to know more, my next course begins in September.

Durante 8 dias acompanhei uma entrega de marmitas organizada pelo Sesi, para famílias e pessoas necessitadas na cidade de Pirassununga. No caso desse vídeo, eu estava São Valentim, na zona norte da cidade.\n\tA comida é produzida no Sesi e levada por meio de um caminhão do exército até a escola onde estava sendo feita a entrega. Ela ocorre graças aos voluntários \u2013 a maioria eram de ONGs como o Grupo de Voluntários no combate ao Câncer (GVCC), Associação Socioambiental Sementes do Amanhã (ASA2) e Juventude pela paz - que se disponibilizam, passar algumas horas do dia para poder fazer com que isso aconteça. \n\tNo momento da entrega, são formadas duas filas, uma para cadastrados e outra para não cadastrados. Primeiro, as marmitas são entregues para os cadastrados, que por estarem no sistema, os voluntários sabiam exatamente a quantidade correta de marmitas a serem entregues (quantidade baseada no número de pessoas em cada família). Após isso, as marmitas que restavam, eram entregues para os não cadastrados. Nos 8 dias que acompanhei a entrega, em todos esses, a fila de pessoas não cadastradas era sempre quase o triplo do tamanho das cadastradas, por sorte, no período em que eu acompanhava em nenhum deles faltaram marmitas. \n\tA entrega para os cadastrados começa perto das 10 horas da manhã, por outro lado, a entrega das marmitas restantes para os não cadastrados começa perto do meio dia. No entanto, os não cadastrados chegam bem antes das 9 horas da manhã para poder garantir o lugar deles na fila e garantir o almoço do dia. \nMúsica: Aboio \u2013 Toinho Melodia \nContato: richelcbpiva@gmail.com \nInstagram: @richel_piva\n#pandemia #hungry #movies #coronavirus #corona ##pandemic \n#fome #doaçao","NumberOfLikes":92,"Hashtags":["#pandemia","#hungry","#movies","#coronavirus","#corona","#pandemic","#fome","#doaçao"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":40,"Timestamp":1598714993,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 29 17:29:53 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"ordergooddeath","CaptionText":"NEW VIDEO\n\nA deep dive into spiritualism, the movement of women who spoke to the dead.

Quem explica melhor a ação é Sérgio Timerman, coordenador do projeto e diretor do Laboratório de Treinamento e Simulação em Emergências Cardiovasculares do InCor do HC da Faculdade de Medicina (FM) da USP, em entrevista ao Jornal da USP no Ar.\n\nEm resumo, o projeto oferece atendimento personalizado para validar protocolos de reabertura. A partir disso, são avaliados itens e cenários que estejam ou não nas novas regras, seguindo estritamente as medidas de combate ao vírus que ainda permanece circulando entre nós, por isso, também é preciso um olhar para além do indivíduo. \u201CA primeira parte que temos que trabalhar, pois sem isso não há projeto de retomada, é a empatia. Empatia e solidariedade para entender que nós temos que nos proteger para proteger o coletivo\u201D, explica o doutor.\n\nA Chancela InCor pretende levar as melhores práticas para as empresas, conscientizando para o fato de que ainda estamos diante de uma pandemia e também mostrando como devemos nos portar com boas práticas de prevenção. Com regras gerais e mais específicas por setor de atuação, práticas seguras como ambiente arejado, janelas e portas abertas, trocas e limpeza de ar-condicionado mais frequentes que são válidas para todos. \n\nLink na bio.\n\nFonte: Jornal USP\n\n#covid19 #coronavirus #ONN #onovonormal #ONNpoliticapublica #covidart #covid2020, #covid19brasil #covidmask #covidphotodiaries #covidnews #covid19art #corona #coronavírus #coronavirusbrazil #coronaviruspandemic #coronavirusoutbreak #coronavirus2020 #pandemic #pandemicart #pandemic2020, #pandemicorona #pandemiclife  #homeoffice #trabalhandoemcasa #emcasa #comolimparmascara  #usemask #mask","NumberOfLikes":6,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#coronavirus","#ONN","#onovonormal","#ONNpoliticapublica","#covidart","#covid2020,","#covid19brasil","#covidmask","#covidphotodiaries","#covidnews","#covid19art","#corona","#coronavírus","#coronavirusbrazil","#coronaviruspandemic","#coronavirusoutbreak","#coronavirus2020","#pandemic","#pandemicart","#pandemic2020,","#pandemicorona","#pandemiclife","#homeoffice","#trabalhandoemcasa","#emcasa","#comolimparmascara","#usemask","#mask"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by O Novo Normal in São Paulo, Brazil.

So here is a little insight about coronaviruses. Coronaviruses have been with us literally from the beginning of the species, but have not made much of a splash before SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Technically speaking, coronavirus is a family characterized by RNA genome and an envelope (lipid coat) among other characteristics. \n\nCOVID-19 is a close relative of the two preceding CoVs that did not result in a pandemic. Impact of CoVs can range from a common cold to more serious illnesses, with 10-15% of COVID-19 patients developing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The latter typically occurs in the elderly, but middle-aged males, diabetics and many other categories of patients bear specific risks. \n\nThere are common CoVs that infect the upper respiratory tract, including nose, sinuses, or upper throat. The are mild, and similar to influenza (common cold) both in severity and location. Chance are you've had a infection by these mild alpha-CoVs . \n\nBeta-coronaviruses such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have recently jumped species and cause a severe immune over-reaction, which cause can be deadly. \n\nMERS infects primarily the lower respiratory tracts resulting in low infectivity, but high mortality. This disease has largely been limited to Saudi Arabia with (80% of human cases). The virus can cause fever, cough, shortness of breath, and sometimes gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea. Once someone is infected with MERS it is likely they will get pneumonia as well.\n\n#learn #COVID #coronaviruses #SARS #MERS #CoV #pandemic #common #respiratory #infection #cold #influenza #pnemonia #diabeties #influenza #human #animal #species #risk #gastrointestinal #human #unexpected","NumberOfLikes":4,"Hashtags":["#learn","#COVID","#coronaviruses","#SARS","#MERS","#CoV","#pandemic","#common","#respiratory","#infection","#cold","#influenza","#pnemonia","#diabeties","#influenza","#human","#animal","#species","#risk","#gastrointestinal","#human","#unexpected"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by FlowCell on August 29, 2020.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598709963,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 29 16:06:03 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"anitascripts","CaptionText":"Just a few of so many more. #pandemic","NumberOfLikes":8,"Hashtags":["#pandemic"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598709951,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 29 16:05:51 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"bloombergopinion","CaptionText":"OK, so it\u2019s not cholera.

Faith, not seeing Him yet believing. Hope, seeing sick and dead people every now and then, gave me that utterance that God gives us hope. Hope that sheds light to those people who are in total darkness. Charity which is the bond of perfectness. Being able to care without being told. I remember Jesus washing His disciples feet and I saw that heart of service. I remember this one unique patient of ours, with an awful smelly necrotic foot. Three times the smell of a dead rat. I need to wash his foot every night with third solution. Sometimes I murmur because of his annoying attitude. Instead of him obeying our rules, he always disobey us. I always cover his foot with dressing so that that smell won't go around places. But he always removed it. So the awesome smell bugs all patients around the room. Another thing, while on blood transfusion, he removed the IV cannula and we found out, he stick it on the wall. He always do this in my shift. Removing every cannula I inserted and that scenario really tested my patience. I remember God's patience towards me. God reminded me that I was once that patient that He keeps on caring. Despite my stubborness, He showed me real grace and mercy. I always remember God's compassion and for always keeping me safe in every encounter of needle puncture, every CPR and this pandemic. Being in the frontline, showed me God's mercy and grace evidently. So much to thank Him for the protection and the virtues I learned during this journey.

With IVF 5 minutes after coming back from our honeymoon, a difficult pregnancy fully of sickness, insomnia, Zika limitations, gestational diabetes and then COVID we haven\u2019t had a break.\n\nAnd I hadn\u2019t realized that that lack of pause had led to my own breaking point.\n\nYes, I had to do some work while we were here, but I did allow myself the grace of unplugging to a certain degree. And just being away gave me that space a freedom to do so.\n\nBeing pregnant and then postpartum during this global pandemic has been mentally one of the hardest things I have ever gone through. Add a grant and stressful career - and it was truly a recipe for disaster.\n\nBut I\u2019m leaving this beautiful beach house feeling like I can handle this next phase of life. And also with the reminder that working non stop - both as a mother and a physician is an unhealthy way of living life.\n\nI know we all don\u2019t have the means to get away like this. But I encourage all of you To create your own space and break in whatever way you can. This pandemic has had mental health consequences that could persist far beyond the pandemic if we don\u2019t face them head on.\n\nI\u2019ll share more about my own journey when I\u2019m ready. But for now I hope you use the post as a reminder to take a little pause and do something for yourself.\n\nAnd million thank you\u2019s to @patvanscoyoc  @stuvanscoyoc and @amandaellis for the most beautiful gift of this quarantine vacation. \n\n#mentalhealthawareness #pandemic #coronavirus #coronababy #doctormom #womeninmedicine #womensupportingwomen #workingmom #workingwomen #mentalhealth #mentalhealthmatters #ppd #ppdawareness #mamasinmedicine","NumberOfLikes":520,"Hashtags":["#mentalhealthawareness","#pandemic","#coronavirus","#coronababy","#doctormom","#womeninmedicine","#womensupportingwomen","#workingmom","#workingwomen","#mentalhealth","#mentalhealthmatters","#ppd","#ppdawareness","#mamasinmedicine"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Dr Anita K Patel MD in Bethany Beach, Delaware with @teawithmd, @dr_flosinha, @amandaellis, @freudandfashion, @amitakundramd, @drsarahkiani, @doctor.saya, @patvanscoyoc, @stuvanscoyoc, @dr.audreyxsue, @drpunamkrishan, @cromulent_lawyer, @dr.pamelamehta, @renamalikmd, @anjalimalikmd, @melissaparsonsmd, @womensmentalhealthdoc, @dr.gut_motility, and @pedsdoctalk.

Our YouTube channel, that started out as a way to communicate with our family and friends while on the Diamond Princess, turned into a beautiful thing, with strangers wishing strangers well around the world. The comments from many people were a source of strength and inspiration for us. The Beauty, Smile 19 fiber collage is my expression of that beauty, strength, and inspiration. It\u2019s hard to communicate to others when your smile is covered. I experienced this daily during both our vacation and quarantine. This fiber collage is a COVID 19 smile on a hand and machine embroidered face mask.  The mask covers a plastic face filled with my hand spun art yarn, hovering over a 19 entwined in a vintage glove. The fiber collage is mounted on a canvas board for easy framing or hanging. It measures 12\u201D x 18.\u201D #quarantineart \n#diamondprincesscruise #quarantine #quarantinelife #pandemicart #pandemiclife #pandemic #documentaryfilm #maskart #Contemporaryart  #artwork #fineart #modernartwork #modernartworks #artistsoﬁnstagram #contemporaryfiberart #textileart #textiles #fiberarts #fiberart #finecrafts #handmade #makersgonnamake #artyarnspinning #artyarn #handspun #handspunyarn","NumberOfLikes":6,"Hashtags":["#quarantineart","#diamondprincesscruise","#quarantine","#quarantinelife","#pandemicart","#pandemiclife","#pandemic","#documentaryfilm","#maskart","#Contemporaryart","#artwork","#fineart","#modernartwork","#modernartworks","#artistsoﬁnstagram","#contemporaryfiberart","#textileart","#textiles","#fiberarts","#fiberart","#finecrafts","#handmade","#makersgonnamake","#artyarnspinning","#artyarn","#handspun","#handspunyarn"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598707238,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 29 15:20:38 CEST 2020","Location":"Syracuse, New York"},{"Owner":"sour._.gasm","CaptionText":"No caption needed 🤭\nFollow up :- @sour._.gasm\n.\n.\n.\n#virushka #mondaymotivation #memesdaily #meme #baby #instagood #instadaily #sarcasm #sarcasticmemes  #funny #dankmemes #funnymemes #lol #follow #humor #like #love #dankmeme #instagram #comedy #lmao #memepage #fun #anime #dailymemes #edgymemes #offensivememes #memestagram #memer #pandemic","NumberOfLikes":4,"Hashtags":["#virushka","#mondaymotivation","#memesdaily","#meme","#baby","#instagood","#instadaily","#sarcasm","#sarcasticmemes","#funny","#dankmemes","#funnymemes","#lol","#follow","#humor","#like","#love","#dankmeme","#instagram","#comedy","#lmao","#memepage","#fun","#anime","#dailymemes","#edgymemes","#offensivememes","#memestagram","#memer","#pandemic"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by MëmëØrgåßm on August 29, 2020.

The radio mix of \"Tell Me\", a track taken from my two-time Global Music Awards winning debut album \"Champagne Attitude\", is my eleventh single thus far! I wrote this song in the mid eighties and not only does it carry a very strong political message, the track could easily have been written a week ago, considering the current state of the world. \n\n\"Tell Me\" is about injustice, war, pollution, homelessness, chaos and related global issues, which are perfectly illustrated in the accompanying music video, which will make its debut on 1 September 2020 on my official Youtube channel AMARU MUSIC. \n\nThe music however features an array of instruments, such as the Indian sitar and tabla, as well as some African percussion, which added to the \"global\" feel of the song, the inclusion of all people! \n\n\"Tell Me (Radio Mix)\" is made up of lyrics that will make you think, with a contrasting beat that will make you get up and dance! \n\nThank you in advance for buying the single via iTunes, Spotify, Tidal, Amazon, Deezer and countless others. 🥳 \n#amaru #international #indie #singer #songwriter #actor #entertainer #youtube #tellme #radiomix #newmusic #music #political #pandemic #social #itunes #spotify #tidal #amazon #deezer #youtubemusic #tiktok","NumberOfLikes":1,"Hashtags":["#amaru","#international","#indie","#singer","#songwriter","#actor","#entertainer","#youtube","#tellme","#radiomix","#newmusic","#music","#political","#pandemic","#social","#itunes","#spotify","#tidal","#amazon","#deezer","#youtubemusic","#tiktok"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The Fashion Minute 🎩 on August 29, 2020.

The patient had tested negative on two separate occasions in the interim. The genomes of the patient\u2019s virus samples were sequenced in April and June, displaying significant genetic discordance between the two cases, implying the patient was infected twice. To solidify confidence in the case, Pandori and the research team partnered with the Washoe County Sheriff\u2019s Office Biology Unit to conduct identity testing on the specimens and lab samples evaluated in the study to verify the specimens were from the same person. Embedded in the genomic material of SARS-CoV-2 is a detailed code that Pandori says may provide insight to better understanding of this virus. \u201CA virus has a biological genome like all living things. Since March, the NSPHL has analyzed the genomic RNA of approximately 200 positive COVID-19 samples from Nevadans who have tested positive for COVID-19,\u201D said Pandori. \u201CThe power of genomic information could turn the tables in the fight against the coronavirus.\u201D The information is shared to a world-wide database known as \u201CGISAID,\u201D alongside the work of thousands of researchers. According to Pandori and the NSPHL-led research team, reinfection cases are a potential warning sign that it is possible to catch COVID-19 more than once, and with unpredictable severity. Herd immunity depends on the theory that after natural infection, our immune systems will collectively protect us as a community from reinfection and further spread. There are currently many more unknowns than knowns about immune responses to COVID-19.

Menjadi tahun yang saya pikir akan menjadi titik kesuksesan saya dalam dunia F&B namun hancur sesaat ketika saya akan melangkah kedalamnya. Semua itu bermula ketika awal tahun terdengar pemberitaan tentang adanya sebuah virus dari negeri china yang pergerakannya sangat masif namun pikirku tidak akan mungkin mempengaruhi kami yang jauh di indonesia terlebih di makassar. Namun dasarnya yah manusia mungkin karena sikap abai kita yang tidak pernah menerapkan protokol kesehatan sedari dini membuat beberapa dari kita yang bahkan tidak sadar membawa virus tersebut masuk ke negeri tercinta ini. Puncaknya ketika foodcourt dimana kami bernaung sudah tidak dapat lagi memanage keadaan yang terjadi akibat dampak covid yang melanda sehingga mengakibatkan banyak diantara kami harus tutup (sementara). Hingga sampai sekarang keadaan belum dapat kembali seperti sediakala meski dengan penerapan kehidupan normal baru yang dicanangkan oleh pemerintah yang jujur cukup membuat saya muak dengan segala pertimbangan yang ada. Sebab jika kita lihat data atau pemberitaan yang ada kurva kasus positif covid masih terus meningkat bahkan mencapai 3.308 per hari ini (sab, 29 agust. Kompas.com) dan dengan kasus sebesar itu kita sekarang seolah mulai abai kembali dengan virus ini. Kan aneh jika awalnya jumlah penyebaran yang sebenarnya bisa dikendalikan malah sekarang yang sudah sangat banyak orang yang terkonfirmasi positif setiap harinya malah di terapkan kehidupan yang normal (meski baru). Esensinya kalau memang toh pada akhirnya semua akan kita biarkan menjadi normal kembali meski dengan keadaan yang tidak benar-benar baik (normal) mengapa sedari awal kita harus menerapkan kehidupan yang serba terbatas sehingga menjatuhkan perekonomian terlebih dahulu. Karena bohong jika penerapan PSBB tanpa kajian dan tidak tau akan dampak yang akan kita hadapai dengan di laksanakannya prosedur tersebut. \n.\nNamun biarlah apa yang terjadi semua sudah kita hadapi dan pasti akan berlalu, saya hanya bisa berharap kita tetap sehat tetap berusaha untuk hal yang kita semogakan.\n.\nsalam 🖖","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1598701487,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 29 13:44:47 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"conquers_official","CaptionText":"Welcoming weekend, have a listen to our weekly playlist:\n\nSeven Orbis- Ganglion\nNahash - The Horns\nMir EI[[]]IE Kgb - Demokratia\nUlver- Angelus Novus\n\nWill soon we uploaded on our spotify too.

against pandemic restrictions which was allowed to go ahead after a bitter legal battle.\n\nPolice said they will turn out in force and strictly monitor compliance with mask-wearing and social distancing, with Berlin police chief Barbara Slowik warning if the demonstrators do not adhere to virus safety rules, police will clear the area \"very quickly.\u201D\n\n\"We will not be able or willing to watch tens of thousands assemble and create infection risks,\" she added.\n\nBerlin city authorities had previously decided not to allow the Saturday demonstration to go ahead, fearing the estimated 22,000 protesters would not keep a distance of 1.5 metres apart or comply with face mask requirements.\n\nThe ban sparked outrage from organisers and their supporters who flooded social media with angry messages vowing to protest anyway, with some even calling for violence.\n\nBut on the eve of the demo, Berlin's administrative court sided with the demonstrators, saying there was no indication that organisers would \"deliberately ignore\" social distancing rules and endanger public health.\n\nAround 3,000 police officers, including 1,000 federal police, will be deployed for the demonstration, alongside specialist equipment including water cannon, Slowik said.\n\nAt a press conference on Friday, Chancellor Angel Merkel said confronting the virus will become more challenging in the coming autumn and winter months.\n\nAt the start of August, a similar \"anti-corona\" march in Berlin took place with 20,000 protesters, a mixture of the hard left and right, anti-vaccination campaigners, conspiracy theorists and self-described \"free thinkers.\u201D\n\nPolice broke up the protest early after participants repeatedly flouted COVID-19 safety regulations.\n\nSeveral countries around the world have seen protests against coronavirus restrictions and lockdown measures in recent months.#s63","NumberOfLikes":11,"Hashtags":["#s63"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Studio 63 in

And even since many restrictions have been lifted, rates of sexual activity haven\u2019t really changed all that much.\u2060\n\u2060\nRegardless of what the sexual activity is (e.g., solo or partnered masturbation, oral sex, vaginal sex, anal sex, etc.), people don\u2019t seem to be engaging in it at the same level they were before the pandemic. \u2060\n\u2060\nSo as social distancing measures have been relaxed and lockdown restrictions have been lifted, studies haven\u2019t really seen a rebound in rates of sexual activity, let alone an increase. There\u2019s a level of stress and anxiety that wasn\u2019t there before the pandemic\u2014and we know that these factors have a tendency to decrease libido.\u2060\n\u2060\n#covid_19 #pandemic #coronavirus #lockdown #sexualactivity #sexualfrequency #sexuality #sexualpractices #drsandrineatallah #drsandrineatallahofficial #وباء #كورونا #د_ساندرين_عطاالله\u2060","NumberOfLikes":232,"Hashtags":["#covid_19","#pandemic","#coronavirus","#lockdown","#sexualactivity","#sexualfrequency","#sexuality","#sexualpractices","#drsandrineatallah","#drsandrineatallahofficial","#وباء","#كورونا","#د_ساندرين_عطاالله\u2060"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Dr Sandrine\/د. ساندرين عطاالله on August 29, 2020.

The next moment, I found myself standing under the vine trellis, a window opened, my camera on hand, and busily shooting the grapes. The problem was I couldn't return to my bedroom following the same route as the window was too high to crawl back. I jumped down from the window when sneaking out, I remembered. \n\nNonetheless, it was worth the trip walking around the house to my room as I liked the shot (generally speaking.) I also enjoyed the walk, checking out the tomatoes riping, eggplants bulging, zucchinis popping here and there, and bees buzzing around the mint garden and rose bushes next to pear trees. I also tasted some of the most delicious grapes. \n\nBTW, thanks for patiently reading my uplifting version of the \"happy at home\" story in the pandemic. Wishing you guys are healthy and safe.

Ik draaide 24 uur mee in een verpleeghuis waar Corona flink om zich heen had gegrepen. Er waren veel bewoners overleden en bijna alle medewerkers van de afdeling waar ik verbleef waren ziek geweest. Mijn moeder zei een paar dagen eerder nog: nou Room, hoeveel mensen kennen we eigenlijk die ziek zijn geweest? Ik kon toen bijna niemand opnoemen. Na vorige week is dat wel anders. Het viel niet mee op tijdens die 24 uur de 1,5 meter afstand te houden. Bewoners wilde mij aanraken, hand in hand door de gangen schuifelen. De verhalen die ik maandenlang via het nieuws had gevolgd, hoorde ik nu van dichtbij. Gruwelijk. Een ander woord heb ik er niet voor. Bovendien waren de gevolgen zichtbaar: lege bedden, beperkt bezoek en na 24 uur was ik emotioneel best wel gesloopt. De beelden heb ik vluchtige bekeken. Ze zijn mooi, intiem en realistisch. Maar is het beeldverhaal ook écht representatief voor deze locatie? Ik ga er niet aan ontkomen om tekst en uitleg te geven. De pandemie is nog niet voorbij lieve mensen. Hou je aan de 1,5 meter. Blijf thuis bij klachten en laat je testen. Dit jaar probeer ik nog 3 locaties te bezoeken. Ik hoop dat de deuren open blijven maar ik hou mijn hart vast.... de eerste afmelding is alweer binnen.

If this was really about our health they wouldn't be selling AIRPLANE TICKETS!!!\n\n#covid19 #covid #coronavirus #pandemic #maskup #masks #clownshow #criticalthinking #bullshit #covidhoax #planneddemic #kidsinmasks #babiesinmasks #childabuse #saveourchildren #savethechildren","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#SIDS","#socialdistancing","#covid19","#covid","#coronavirus","#pandemic","#maskup","#masks","#clownshow","#criticalthinking","#bullshit","#covidhoax","#planneddemic","#kidsinmasks","#babiesinmasks","#childabuse","#saveourchildren","#savethechildren"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598678990,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 29 07:29:50 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"bndikilitas","CaptionText":"Bugün içimde 4 yılın sonunda ailesinin yanında, memleketinde göreve başlayacak bir öğretmen sevinci var. Son 5 gündür Osman Yağızı ananesi ve babasıyla bırakıp Van da evrak işlerimi halletmek için bulunuyordum. Bu süreçte tek başıma bebekle uçak yolculuğu yaptım ve geçen 4 yılda çokça bu durumu deneyimlediğim için size ufak bir kaç tüyo vermek istedim 😊 \n🌟 Benim elim ayağım yine her zamanki gibi kangurumuz oldu. @huggyberrycom marble mist modelini kullanıyorum çok memnunum. Kendisi 2 çocuk büyüttü 😂 ama bi 3 tane daha büyütür öyle sağlam ✌🏻👏🏻 \n🌟 Uçak kalkarken ve inerken bebeği emzirmek olası kulak ağrılatının önüne geçiyor 👍🏻 eğer emzirmiyorsanız sakız verebilir veya süt vb tarzda bir içecek içirebilirsiniz. Önemli olan yutkunmak.\n🌟 Ömer kanguruda uyumayı çok sevse de 1 saat sonra kalkınca oyun oynamak istiyor buna ben kanguruya asılan tarzda bir oyuncakla çözüm buldum. Emzik zinciri emzik kullanmasak bile çok iş gördü bize.\n🌟Yanınıza ilgisini çekecek kitap vb bir ürün alabilirsiniz.\n🌟 Pandemi sebebiyle hijyen açısından kendi su şişesini de almanızda fayda var. \n🌟 uçak içerisinde sosyal mesafe pek mümkün değil ancak lütfen yanınızdan dezenfektanınızı eksik etmeyin. ❗️Maskelerinizi çıkartmayın ❗️\n🌟 Pandemi sebebiyle kabin bagajı alamıyorsunuz içeriye sadece çok büyük olmayan bir bebek çantası izniniz var. Hijyen açısından çok acil ihtiyacınız olabilecek ürünler dışında bir şey almayın.\n🌟Kabin hakkınız kalkmış olmasına rağmen ana bagaj hakkınız yurt içi uçuşlarda hala 15 kg işe sınırlı ayrıca bebek için 10 kg normal bagaj hakkı bulunuyor.\n🌟 Havalimanları içerisinde maske takmak zorunlu olsa da herkes yeterince dikkat etmediği için siz maksimum önlemi almak zorundasınız. Bebek bakım odası kullanmak zorunda kalırsanız lütfen alt değiştirme ünitesinde temas edebileceği her yeri önce dezenfektan ile temizleyin ve ardından normalde kullanmasanız bile kullan-at bir alt değiştirme örtüsü serin.\n🌟 Uçaklar yolculuktan önce dezenfekte ediliyor ancak biz dönerken yarım saat önce inmiş bir uçağa binmek zorunda kaldık dolayısıyla oturduğumuz alanı ve ön koltuğun arka kısmını güzelce temizledik. \nUmarım faydalı olmuştur.\n#seyahat #uçak #yolculuk #plane #pandemic","NumberOfLikes":257,"Hashtags":["#seyahat","#uçak","#yolculuk","#plane","#pandemic"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Büşra Neşe in İstanbul Sabiha Gökçen International Airport with @pegasusairlines, @gezginlerle, @huggyberrycom, @gezginlerdiyorki, @seyyah.kitap, @gezibaglari, @gezginler_traveler, @gezgingrup, @gezilecek1yer, @cik.gez, @seyyahdefterii, @gezgoryasaclup, and @gezginlerkesfecikiyoruz.
