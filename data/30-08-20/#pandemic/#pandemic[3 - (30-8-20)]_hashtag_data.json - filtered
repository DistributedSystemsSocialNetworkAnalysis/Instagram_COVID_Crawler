After learning HTML at age 11 and beginning his first internship at just 14, Karp and computer engineer Marco Arment founded Tumblr, a microblogging platform in 2007 when he was just 21. \n\nHost to more than 190 million blogs, Tumblr sold to Yahoo! in 2013 for a staggering $1.1 billion. Instead of focusing on making money, Karp is driven by passion, and is dedicated to keeping Tumblr a space for creativity and self-expression. \n\nHe was dead-set on not \"selling out,\" and managed to stay in control of his company even when he did eventually sign over the deed to Yahoo! After the deal, he shared his longterm vision with Bloomberg TV, stating, \"hopefully we get this right, and Tumblr will be home to the most aspiring and talented creators all over the world.\" \n.\n.\n.\n.\n#africa #US #europe #nothernprovince #unitedstates #epidemic #inspiration #entrepreneurs #builders #pandemic #cnn #bbc #products #government #states #restofafrica #news #newsupdate #followtrain2020 #followtrain #followforfollowback #gaintrain #gainwithmchina #gainwithxtiandela #gains","NumberOfLikes":8,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Rise!Zine on August 28, 2020.

I was soon proven wrong as articles posted online showed engineers and motorcycle experts urging the government to study the policy before implementing it. \n\nSome of the articles that i've read stated that it'll offset the balance of the motorcycle because of the change of drag and lift. Another, is due to the air resistance caused by the divider, a gust of wind may affect the rider to lose control of the motorcycle. Lastly, because of the additional resistance, it'll cost greater consumption of gas.\n\nWith all these negative effects of the barrier, it begs the question - \"Is the barrier really necessary?\". The Department of Health (DOH) minimum protocol states that wearing a face mask and avoiding touching off the face and then adding to that the required helmet for riders should really be enough. \n\nBut the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) still firmly believes that this policy is not a safety concern for the motorcycle's stability. The DILG secretary even said to engineers and motorcycle experts, \"Pagdating sa motor naniniwala ako na expert kayo, pero pag dating sa pandemic, huwag kayong nagmamarunong.\"\n\nWhat he said just reflects on the disconnection between the government and its citizens. They should be partnering with real engineers and experts to find real solutions to real public problems and not half assed ideas that are not even studied carefully. \n\nSo please gov't listen to your people. We aren't your bashers, we are your partners. People are crying out to be heard and it's up to all of you to open your open your minds and do your job the way it is supposed to be done.\n\nStop making solutions to a problem you haven't even identified. \n\n.\n.\n\n#motorcycle #motorcycleshield #motorcyclebarrier #DILG #Pandemic #covid19ph #Philippines\n#EveryDayPhilippines \n #newnormal #lockdown #streetphotography #capturestreets #quarantine #mecq #gcq #urbanphotography #kuhangpinoy #talaarawanph #streetmagazine #streetphotographydaily #zonestreet #streetouss #rawshotmag #ourstreets #seepilipinas #street_story","NumberOfLikes":217,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ej muyrong on August 28, 2020.

Clutter, early in 1847, enlisted a detachment of thirty-two men in Monongalia county, for service in the War with Mexico. They were known as the \"Mountain Boys of Monongalia,\" and all left Morgantown, May 21, 1847, and proceeded to Fortress Monroe, Virginia, where they were attached to Company B of the Thirteenth United States Infantry, of which John Tyler was captain.

I can barely sit idle and constantly try my hand at new things. I used to love dressing up and experimenting. So much so, that I made it my profession.  I keep thinking about how I can give back to my society and bring about a change, no matter how small\", says our #womanoftheweek #SonaSingh from #LAJADelhi. \n\nSona always dreamt of being her own boss so worked hard to carve her own way. In 2006, she set off on her journey of opening a #fashionstudio under the name \"Threads and more\". She not only made a good market for herself, but also participated in several fashion shows and was the talk of the town for her #minimalistic approach towards #fashion and #wardrobemakeovers. Sona gradually started another thread by the name \"Threads\" that aimed at bringing organics to the drawing room and wardrobe of a common woman. She associated with weavers from Kutch and Wear Bengal and the Vyanjana theatre group wherein she conducted plays for senior citizens and differently abled kids. Speaking of her adoration towards kids, she connected with Don Bosco foundation which is working towards the #education and #upliftment of homeless girls by rehabilitating them. \n\"Since day one, I wanted to work for \/with #artisans as I was always attracted towards the diversity of Indian art and culture. The #pandemic hit my work hard and I had to wind up my blooming business due to lack of work and never--ending overheads. But as they say A #WOMAN CAN NEVER STOP.\nI decided to work for artisans who are suffering because of this current situation\", she says. \nToday, she and her team are pushing themselves past their limits every single day. \n\n\"Education is the greatest asset for a woman to truly make herself a self sufficient individual.  I strongly believe that the ultimate call for freedom has to be taken by the woman herself. So, the biggest hurdle for #womenempowerment for me is not the society or patriarchy, it is the fear of women themselves to be free. Ultimately, a woman is the creator of the world, and I believe she is capable enough to be the creator of her own destiny\", she says.","NumberOfLikes":17,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by LAJA For Women on August 28, 2020.

Today I spoke with a woman whose father was the 1st covid19 related memorial that I had to officiate online. Tragically, 3 more of her relatives have died since her father\u2019s death.\n\nIn my line of work I\u2019ve experienced many unique situations & I rarely miss a beat in a conversation regardless of how \u201Cunexpected\u201D the topic may be. This morning during my conversation with the daughter I suddenly went silent. After describing her family\u2019s lethal experience with covid19 she strayed into discussing her alarm at witnessing the unprotected crowds at last night\u2019s Republican convention.\n\nI couldn\u2019t tell where the conversation was going until she shared that her father believed the President when he labeled covid19 a hoax. I heard anger in her voice & then she asked me, \u201CHow do I send my relatives\u2019 ashes to the White House?\u201D She added, \u201CMaybe then they\u2019ll realize the pandemic is real.\u201D\n\nAs a member of the clergy I know that in the USA cremains (ashes) can be shipped through the USPS but \u201Cpriority mail express\u201D must be used. I didn\u2019t share these details with her because I understood I was hearing her grief & frustration talking.\n\nWhen I finally responded I said, \u201CI admire that you\u2019re commitment to social action & want to put a face to our country\u2019s 180,000+ covid19 deaths. My response brought her to tears as I let her know I understood her desire to protect others from experiencing the unnecessary loss of their loved ones. I suggested she join a local action group to educate the public about the importance of testing, social distancing, & wearing masks. I added that voting on 11\/3 was the best political statement she could make \u2013 she agreed & asked me to share her story.üôèüôèüèøüôèüèæüò∑üåéüåèüåç#covid_19 #shelterinplace #masks #testing #socialdistancing2020 #bereavement #bereavementsupport #cremation #onlinememorial #chaplain #minister #grief #tragedy #socialaction #socialactivism #vote #pandemic #toomanydeaths #stayhealthy #protectyourself #washyourhands #actresponsibly #caringforothers #compassion","NumberOfLikes":23,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Bonnie Sluser Lester in Dublin, California.

As well as for fans alike. \n\nAmazon pushes forward with a green effort with purchasing 1800 electric vans. But they still have a long way to prove in major efforts of sustainability which include their packaging and employee safety.\n\nThe accelerated shopping season seen from the start of quarantine is starting to see a decline. Which is driving another prediction of shopping malls to see closing within the next 5 years. As they were predicted years ago as well, but this time may be more plausible now.\n\nLastly, get prepared early for this holiday shopping season. You may want to get your I.O.U. cards ready just in case. Due to COVID, USPS delays, and warehousing within small businesses, the holidays may be shipping a lot slower as we have been seeing our packages thus far. So check your list twice and get ahead. \n\nüí° What\u2019s your take away from the recent news?

Your images and your project are very thought provoking and mysterious. They are full of stories waiting to be discovered! I would strongly encourage you to keep pursuing your ideas.\" \n\nAnd today even though I feel like I lost all the energy to pursue my ideas, I will try for you, my critic.

Getting high grades, good SAT or ACT scores, taking multiple AP exams, asking for letters of recommendation, and participating in extracurricular activities take months or years of preparation.\n\nBut for students who are planning on applying to college, this process has been more stressful due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Schools going remote, SAT and ACT tests canceled, extracurricular activities postponed, and many other changes have occurred in the past year.\n\nIn addition to the changes brought about the pandemic, there have been other changes to the process, including how students can be recruited, financial incentives, and transfer rules.\n\nIn this webinar, Moon Prep will cover everything you need to know about the changing college admissions scene. Participants will be able to ask their questions about college admissions and get advice from an experienced college admissions counselor.\n\nJoin us on September 3!

This has probably been the most intense, busy, strange, and exhausting first week of school I\u2019ve ever experienced, and I\u2019ve been doing this on and off since 2004. There\u2019s a lot on the plate of teachers trying to stay safe and still teach and be there for their students in the midst of a pandemic. Yet, as usual, we somehow got the job done. I accomplished a lot more than I expected to this week, despite the insanity of it all. My in-person students are happy and did well on their first set of weekly tests. I got to Zoom with my online students today, and they also appear happy and to be doing well. In the end, I guess I can\u2019t really ask for more considering the circumstances. Somehow, some way, we all managed to survive the first week of school.

This is true for any profession, but especially for the legal one. Lawyers are used to meet clients, hold meetings with fellow colleagues and go to court. These are all things, that can't be achieved this year since there is a growing danger of getting infected. \n\nEven if a vaccine is found, the world will forever be different. One thing that is sure is that things will change. As mentioned in previous posts, lawyers have to constantly adapt to changes in order to stay competitive as well as up to date. \n\nTherefore, we introduce some insights how the legal world will change after this pandemic: \n\nOne way the legal world will change is that law culture will be forced to work from home more frequently. Whether lawyers like it or not, the reality of home office is getting more real by the day. Even big law firms will soon consider the possibility of making some days free for home office. Of course, this has also negative consequences. For example, lawyers will not be able to convince other people the way they used to. Video calls are fine, but do not convey the same emotions to an audience. Be that as it be, here comes the next change of the legal world. \n\nThis is the next important point. Client contact will change. Lawyers will need to seek new ways to contact clients. Meeting in person is, sadly, an option that could disappear in the next few years.

My injured foot started hurting again. I believed #lockdown would help me #heal but when lockdown got extended and i didn't have any visibility of the #pandemic situation getting better and no travel plans for the year...that's where i started giving up on all aspects of life, including myself.\n\nI decided to take a step back and turn things around for myself. For what it was worth, I started by telling myself, \"I deserve to be #happy and I will stand up for myself, no matter what!\" After few days of introspection, I wanted to make some changes in my life. 1. Fight #insomnia. I knew it would take time but no matter what i will give it all. 2. I will not let #stress at work affect me. 3. I will #learn something #new #everyday\n\nFocussing on the last point, out of the many things i learnt, the most important one was caring for myself. I had already been working out regularly. I made a conscious effort to manage my work time so that i could log off on time. I learnt to manage stakeholder's expectation and tell myself it wouldn't hurt to complete something next day. When I was not well a couple of times, i unapologetically communicated to my team and took an hour's rest, something i wouldn't do couple of months before this. I have started believing if i needed help, i just had to ask for it. I learnt to accept my vulnerabilities. I have always been telling myself i'm too busy but I reconnected with old friends and relatives individually. I found #peace.\n\nSecondly, I learnt new skills - Not machine learning, but practical and simple stuffs that kept me engaged and happy. #Cooking #foodphotography, montages, sewing, growing herbs, plants propagation, home decor and so many other things! I even learnt how to style men's hair with amd without a trimmer. Thanks to YouTube and the man who trusted me with his hair! I probably would not have learnt any of this if there was no lockdown!\n\nIn short, we can never know how much time we've got so why not make each day count by learning new things and prioritising self!\n#aaaeee \n#alsolearning\n#learningbeyondboundaries\nThx @sayanki16","NumberOfLikes":64,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":13,"Timestamp":1598646671,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 28 22:31:11 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Lee Mingwei: Á¶Æ Li, Gifts and Rituals at Gropius Bau.

The Blues are also thought to be on the verge of signing Thiago Silva and Kai Havertz, but their plans might need to be halted to avoid any further spread of the virus. The players in question are said to have been tested at the end of last week before a potential return to training, and it continued the trend of a rise in cases across the division.

At the time, I was a few months away from travelling and aspired to work remotely. I've known for a long time that I didn't want to settle down in one place just yet. But I didn't know how I'd fund this location independent lifestyle.\n\nAfter a couple online courses and months of research, I decided to begin my journey with a blog and diversify from there.\n\nAt university, I studied zoology, a subject I'm very passionate about. I didn't want to abandon science altogether and desired to combine my education with my love of travel. I wanted to produce a valuable resource for those interested in sustainable travel, remote work & conservation.\n\nI finally launched The Runaway Grad in February of 2020 and, after some rocky months of lockdowns and travel cancellations, I've finally committed to creating content. While, I dreamed of writing my own posts and stories, I had no idea how blogging would feel. After 8 posts and two months of writing, I can tell you that it's so much more rewarding than I anticipated. And that was before anyone started reading.\n\nIt has, however, only been 2 months. That's no time at all, really. But so far, I love this world of blogging. I'm eager to learn more and work harder to produce better content and useful resources for you.\n\nThe coming months will be a challenge and less free than we all hoped, but I'm now on a mission. 2021 will bring great things for all of us. Yes, we'll have to adapt to the new world, but I know we can make next year a better one! üíô","NumberOfLikes":7,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by üåçThe Runaway Grad in County Durham.

I remember thinking Born In The USA was a weird song as a kid because I just didn\u2019t feel the need to sing about patriotism. Years later I would discover that the song was a protest song addressing the fact that Americans deserve better than what we\u2019re getting.  Sounds pretty familiar doesn\u2019t it?\n\nDancing In The Dark was a fun little tune, but was a bit more mature for me and so was I\u2019m On Fire.  The only song that I could really connect with back then was Glory Days.  Being a kid who played baseball in small town Oklahoma, I was able to understand what he was selling in his lyrics.  Now, the whole album is just a testament to the early 80\u2019s American culture and it still holds up to this day. \n\n-\n\nThe album finds its center in those cheering rock songs, but four tracks \u2013 the last two on either side \u2014 give the album an extraordinary depth. Springsteen has always been able to tell a story better than he can write a hook, and these lyrics are way beyond anything anybody else is writing. - Debby Miller - 1984 Rolling Stone Review - 5 out of 5 stars\n\n#BruceSpringsteen #BornInTheUsa #USA #vinyl #vinyllove #vinylporn #vinyllover #vinylrecord #vinylcollection #vinyljunkie #vinylrecords #vinyladdict #vinylcollector #vinylcommunity #vinylcollectionpost #love #quarantine #pandemic #music #vinylcollector\n\n- \n\nListening to only one song on an album is like looking at only one corner of a painting.

The weather is finally bearable, there's something pleasant about those cooler mornings and evenings, everything starts afresh with the new school year and end of summer, leaves change. I was desperately awaiting October this year, overexcited to go back to work after seven months spent working from home (as opposed to the one month that was announced back in March), ready to take out clothes that don't resemble fitness attire and to finish what was started months ago. But life has a different plan. This is why I, the Type A who always plans everything, gave up on planning a long time ago. Just let things happen. This year has taught us that and more. There's no point in planning; there's no reason to put things off for later (oh the things I was supposed to do this year! Seems funny now), there's reason to be grateful for work, health, and family; there's always next year. As for this year, while I'm still stuck working from home without a proper desk or adequate lighting, I'll take what I can get and will make the most of it.\/\/ One of our spontaneous trips planned at the last minute (instead of our long road trip to Seattle, Oregon, and California üò≠ - canceled among many other things) ended at a park in Pennsylvania, where autumn is slowly creeping in. #autumn #reflection #reflecting #pandemic #2020 #leaves #pennsylvania #birkenstock #plans #planning #spontaneous #roadtrip #roadtrips #placetobe #outdoorsy #beauty #wilderness #wildernessculture #nature #naturelover #outdoors #wanderer #wanderlust #womenwhoexplore #living #liveoutdoors #optoutside #stayandwander #gooutside #travelphotography","NumberOfLikes":6,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598642774,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 28 21:26:14 CEST 2020","Location":"Ohiopyle State Park"},{"CaptionText":"Children being sold and use in sex Trafficking","NumberOfLikes":3,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1598642690,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 28 21:24:50 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#mask #shopping #fashion\n#stayathome #newnormal #covid #loveyourself #socialdistancing #india #staysafe #coronavirus #stayhome #bollywood #help #corona #instagram #stayhealthy #covid19 #like #viral #lockdown #workfromhome #repost  #quarantine #pandemic #love #likeforlike #instagood #beauty #safetyfirst","NumberOfLikes":11,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598642674,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 28 21:24:34 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Done for the day except making dinner, its all prepped & a easy one.

I\u2019ve called out before to relax & enjoy my day. but I\u2019ve never been 100% honest with my coworkers when I need a mental health day. yesterday afternoon I gave my supervisor a heads up, and she said she understood and was nothing but kind about it. I sent out an email at 5:30am typed from last night stating just this: \u201CI am calling out sick today, I need a mental health day. I\u2019m fine, I promise, just need a little self-care time away from work. I\u2019ll see you all Monday.\u201D having a supportive work environment with supervisors and coworkers who care for me is huge. I am very open about having depression and anxiety, and I haven\u2019t called out sick once throughout the year. I honored myself by taking the day to relax and rejuvenate, because I\u2019ve been feeling quite burnt out and very depressed. but by being honest about why I am calling out makes me feel guilt-free. mental health is just as important as physical health, and just like I wouldn\u2019t feel guilty for calling out to deal with the flu, I\u2019m not going to feel guilty for taking the day for me. I read my book by my apartment complex pool, I did some laundry, I meditated, I showered for the first time in a few days. I watched TV and put on a face mask.

When you use fear as the tactic to meet your goal, and you have a media pushing that narrative, that #media attention you enjoy, simply embeds images of #violence and abuses in the minds of those sitting at home during a #pandemic trying to protect their families. Those images after two years on bombardment will never go away for most people and will ultimately contribute to those people teaching their #children that #blackpeople are violent and dangerous. That ends up perpetuating the opposite of what BLM is supposedly fighting against. Those people and their children will choose #lawandorder everytime.  72% or 97 Million Americans are identified as non-hispanic white, as opposed to the 12% or 37 million #BlackAmericans being represented by the small #BlackLivesMatter minorty being projected as representatives by media. Add to that the other 20% of #Asian Hispanic, Middle Eastern population seeing the #blackviolence in the name of BLM and you have close to 90% population watching BLM and their views being forever changed. At first sympathetic, latter self protective - making a large percentage of that 90% population suspicious of all #blacks. Just like people who saw Reginald Denny pulled from his truck and beaten for driving his truck delivering products to #Compton in the Rodney King riots, Americans made the decision not to stop and become another #ReginaldDenny given the same circumstances. Thus we now have cars going through people blocking or surrounding cars in #BLM.  It a shame.","NumberOfLikes":3,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Randy Dreammaker on August 28, 2020.

The vast majority of offices cannot isolate within a \u201Cbubble,\u201D so companies must plan for the new normal of working around COVID-19. The most effective way for employers to avoid a breakout is by utilizing effective PPE and social distancing measures. üò∑\nBeyond PPE and social distancing, there will be a demand for health testing and contact tracing. Both of these preventative measures will require robust data capabilities in order to process the massive influx of employee data.

Music lifts our spirits &¬†brings joy & comfort. Kids need to feel safe & happy all the time!\n\nQ: What motivated you when things may have felt impossible?\n\n¬ª It was very important to me that my own children & my students keep continuity with piano lessons. My method is based on¬†creating music & creating music is a magical journey. Nothing¬†is impossible! Yes, it can be difficult at first but it is not impossible.\n\nQ: Biggest difficulty you had with teaching online?\n\n¬ª I learned over years that life is always changing. I learned how to dance in the storm, this life skill I am teaching my kids & my students¬†as well. Transition from in home to online lessons was difficult for me, I was not able to share hugs with my students or play¬†piano duets & trios. But I quickly educated myself about online lessons in general & things started to go smoother.\n\nI have never taught piano lessons online before. My students are ages¬†3.5 and up. To engage little ones online was the biggest challenge for me. Luckily \"Stuck Inside Survival Guide\" was created right¬†on time & my¬†online lessons become super interesting for students of all ages. Thank you Stacey so much for creating it!\n\nQ: Favourite story of teaching online?\n\n¬ª My students started to improve with sight reading a lot! I realized how they become more independent via online lessons. Usually, in home, I would step in right away if they are struggling with music notes but online I was not able to do it. That was my eye opening moment as a teacher.¬†In May we had our very first Zoom Recital, that was exciting & new. I love how we had a big audience, friends¬†& families zooming in from all over the world to show us support¬†& enjoy performances. \"Show must go on!\"\n\n\u2022\n\nJoin the conversation!

Bring your ID +\/- a piece of mail with your new address if you are moving (some states require you to be a state resident).\n2. Wear your mask and bring sanitizer. There are some items being touched by hundreds of people like the pens, clipboards so you can consider gloves for that. \n3. Want a face shield? Check out @filausa and their new visor shields. Who said you cant be stylish?\n4. Take a picture of your requisition with your phone. When you call asking for results they may ask for these numbers and you may lose the paper. \n5. Keep your mouth covered while testing (just move mask down).\n6. For the actual test, it will be uncomfortable. The deeper it goes and the longer it stays in your nose the more effective the test and the lower the false negative rate. It should be an unpleasant experience but here are my tips for getting through it- find something to hold on to (not the nice testing staff) like your phone or your leg. Tilt your head back and try your best to relax your nostrils. If your nose and throat are tense it hurts so much more. The swab will touch the back of your upper throat and cause you to cough but just breathe through it. The more you tense, the longer it takes. \n7. Congratulations! You took your test.

Monthly post (more efficient than weekly post). We got our first #Monsoon. It took WAY longer than usual. The #sunset that day was gorgeous. That next morning I found a massive #Beetle outside. Look at this humongous beast! Started growing #Microgreens indoors. They are delicious in salads! And this is a recycled container. Trying to do small things for the environment. Also, always nice to keep in touch with loved ones in times of #Pandemic... miss you @thetinces . Driving through #Chandler, there was a little evidence of the protests going on around the country. One vandalized political sign.\nHighlight! We took a day trip to #WorkmansCreek, near Globe, AZ. The heat allowed us to take a hike, have a picnic and embrace nature for a few hours. We were celebrating my father in law's first birthday without us. I got lucky and found wild peaches! They were fantastic! Last but not least, I embarked in an intense project. Refinishing my dining set. Wish me luck! With this heat I cannot progress much. In Phoenix, temperatures haven't been less than 110 F during the day for about 2 months, so any outdoor work is either slowed down, or banned. I started another indoors project: Cleaning up my PS4... well, I broke a microcomponent, but it is \"fixed\" now. Gotta learn to be careful with these machines ! I do enjoy putting devices apart though... and power tools. I found myself a teacher who will guide me in the path of woodworking! We will trade knowledge. I teach her how to build websites, and she teaches me how to refinish, repair, and build - hopefully- with wood. Yay!\nLife in Pandemic is different. Slowed down; enjoyable; contrasting; far away but connected. We lost a family member on a #Covid battle. She will be missed but I am thankful she's not suffering anymore.
