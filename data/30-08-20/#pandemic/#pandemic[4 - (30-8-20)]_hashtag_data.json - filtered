But it's quite predictable. \n\nVidyut Jamwal is just amazing and is seen in a different way. He does fight a lot in the movie but he had to let go of his martial arts and fight like a normal man. That's what was unique this time with Vidyut.\nBut with all the tries Vidyut still looks so perfect fighting.\n\nOn the other hand Shivaleeka Oberoi has a soft part. \nAnnu Kapoor doesn't fail to amaze, he so versatile, that whatever character he does he does it with perfection. \n\nI would say a good movie with even better cast. \n\n#khudahaafiz #vidyutjammwal #jamwalions #bollywood #ott #shivaleekaoberoi #aahanakumra mra #shivpandit #annukapoor #farukkabir #hindi #action #thriller #hotstar #disney #instagram #movies #movie #cinematography #noman #pandemic #bingewatching #binge #online #cinema","NumberOfLikes":25,"Hashtags":["#khudahaafiz","#vidyutjammwal","#jamwalions","#bollywood","#ott","#shivaleekaoberoi","#aahanakumra","#shivpandit","#annukapoor","#farukkabir","#hindi","#action","#thriller","#hotstar","#disney","#instagram","#movies","#movie","#cinematography","#noman","#pandemic","#bingewatching","#binge","#online","#cinema"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598631858,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 28 18:24:18 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"cbctoronto","CaptionText":"Plans for back-to-school are coming into sharper focus, but it's still hard to imagine what a day in the classroom will look like come September.\n\u2022\nThe students aren't back yet, but Ali Chiasson got a sneak peek at Wexford Collegiate School for the Arts in Scarborough.\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nüìÑ: Ali Chiasson\/CBC, @cbc_ali\nüé•: Paul Borkwood\/CBC\n#cbctoronto #cbcto #highschool #backtoschool #newschoolyear #covid19 #pandemic","NumberOfLikes":179,"Hashtags":["#cbctoronto","#cbcto","#highschool","#backtoschool","#newschoolyear","#covid19","#pandemic"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":8,"Timestamp":1598631838,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 28 18:23:58 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"thesecuritydistillery","CaptionText":"Last week we published the seventh episode of our interview series on the Political Implications of the Pandemic.

Quite often, the line of cars reached outside of the parking lot. People are hurting.\n\nJeanni and her family believe that \"if you can, you should\". Serving others is just what they do. Four years ago they started their own food drive called Baskets of Grace, which feeds families at Thanksgiving.

Some are helping at food pantries, others are making masks, while others have given up their time in other ways. Many have even donated their services to organizations so that they could stay afloat during these uncertain times. It all matters. \n\nWe would love to hear your stories of how you or your family have helped your community!

Within those three words lies a complex web of partnerships, transactions, and logistics. It\u2019s a system that we \u2013 as restaurant-goers \u2013 have taken for granted because it seems to runs effortlessly in the background.\n.\nWith the arrival of COVID-19, our role as unconscious consumers has now come to an end because the systems we have relied on for so long are in jeopardy. Farmers are in trouble and, as you know, so are restaurants. So what\u2019s going on, exactly? How can we help? These questions, and more, were explored in the newest episode of the Food Under Fire podcast. I sat down with Tracy Singleton (owner of @birchwoodcafe in Minneapolis) and Gary Wertish (president of the @mnfarmersunion) to talk about the interrelationship between farms and restaurants and how that system \u2013 invisible to the eyes of consumers \u2013 is under threat. It\u2019s a complex conversation, but we did our best.\n.\nThe full episode is now available on Spotify and Apple Podcasts. Hit the link in my bio for access to both.

I'm Amber, a Child and Family Therapist and mother of two. @connectwithplay is a page dedicated to the parent-child connection. \n\nExperts agree that when a caregiver is able to stay calm during stressful interactions with their child(ren), this will in turn promote self-regulation, a positive sense of self and better mental health overall for the child. \n\nThe issue a lot of us face is the fact that attachment relationships can bring out all of our raw emotions and unmet needs from our own childhood. We can be completely regulated at work and in the community, but lose our control with the people who are closest to us. So, please know that we've all been in a spot where we have lost control as parents. \n\nWhat I always see in parenting information is practical scripts (love these) and relaxation exercises, which is helpful, but if we are coming from a place of unmet needs, we also may not have recieved the skills to really regulate ourselves. Instead we may be continuing the trend of internalizing our emotions. Just as children can only do well with the skills they have, parents can only do their best with the skills they have. \n\nThis post speaks to those skills we may not be using in those difficult moments. It is simply to help provide more in depth way of tending  to ourselves in order to help our child.  Like with any skill, it will take practice. The best thing we can do is keep trying. \n\nPlease let me know if this information helps you. Even if one slide assists you in gaining more peace, it will be worth the effort it took to create this for you.

Karena kompetisi perebutan rekomendasi ini juga direbutkan oleh power politik lain di luar Bu Risma yang akhirnya DPP jadi harus mempertimbangkan dua kali untuk mengumumkan nama calon.

Fallout 4!\n\nFallout 4 is an action role-playing game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks. It is the fourth main game in the Fallout series. The game is set within an open world post-apocalyptic environment that encompasses the city of Boston and the surrounding Massachusetts region known as \"The Commonwealth\". It makes use of a number of local landmarks, including Bunker Hill, Fort Independence (Massachusetts), and Old North Bridge near Concord, as the bridge out of Sanctuary Hills. The main story takes place in the year 2287, ten years after the events of Fallout 3 and 210 years after \"The Great War\", which caused catastrophic nuclear devastation across the United States.\n\nThe player assumes control of a character referred to as the \"Sole Survivor\", who emerges from a long-term cryogenic stasis in Vault 111, an underground nuclear fallout shelter. After witnessing the murder of their spouse and kidnapping of their son, the Sole Survivor ventures out into the Commonwealth to search for their missing child. The player explores the game's dilapidated world, completes various quests, helps out factions, and acquires experience points to level up and increase the abilities of their character. New features to the series include the ability to develop and manage settlements and an extensive crafting system where materials scavenged from the environment can be used to craft drugs and explosives, upgrade weapons and armor, and construct, furnish and improve settlements. Fallout 4 also marks the first game in the series to feature full voice acting for the protagonist.\n#fallout \n#wearamask #masks #maske #prayers #salvation #socxplosion #playstation #maskup #forgiveness #masked #mascarillas #apocalypse #mask #facemaskselfie #videogames #portraitinspiration #trustgod #virus #godlovesyou #protectyourself #maskon #brunchlife #quarantine2020 #masks4all #portraitgames #sundaybrunch #wearmask #socks #pandemic","NumberOfLikes":62,"Hashtags":["#fallout","#wearamask","#masks","#maske","#prayers","#salvation","#socxplosion","#playstation","#maskup","#forgiveness","#masked","#mascarillas","#apocalypse","#mask","#facemaskselfie","#videogames","#portraitinspiration","#trustgod","#virus","#godlovesyou","#protectyourself","#maskon","#brunchlife","#quarantine2020","#masks4all","#portraitgames","#sundaybrunch","#wearmask","#socks","#pandemic"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Steven Bonanno on August 28, 2020.","NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1598622265,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 28 15:44:25 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"cassiopeia_ltd","CaptionText":"@clp_react_and_protect CYBER FORENSICS, LAW & PR SERVICES\n\nCLP React & Protect provide a comprehensive services to deal with legal, forensic & PR requirements for range of cyber security & data breach incidents.\n\n‚ñ™ CYBER SECURITY & DIGITAL FORENSICS\n\n‚ñ™ BUSINESS EMPLOYMENT LAW\n\n‚ñ™ REGULATORY LAW\n\n‚ñ™ LITIGATION\n\n‚ñ™ PR & REPUTATION MANAGMENT\n.\n.\n.\n#cybersecurity #settlement #privacy #security #cyber #informationsecurity #databreach #dataprotection #datasecurity #gdpr #legal #lawyer #compliance #management #help #digital #pr #react #clp #Cassiopeia #CLP #Coronavirus #Pandemic #misconduct #employmentlaws #regulatorylaw #regulators #digitalforensics #PR #reputationmanagment","NumberOfLikes":3,"Hashtags":["#cybersecurity","#settlement","#privacy","#security","#cyber","#informationsecurity","#databreach","#dataprotection","#datasecurity","#gdpr","#legal","#lawyer","#compliance","#management","#help","#digital","#pr","#react","#clp","#Cassiopeia","#CLP","#Coronavirus","#Pandemic","#misconduct","#employmentlaws","#regulatorylaw","#regulators","#digitalforensics","#PR","#reputationmanagment"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598622225,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 28 15:43:45 CEST 2020","Location":"London, United Kingdom"},{"Owner":"monirosa_ochaofficial","CaptionText":"Ini bisnisku guys\n\nHappynya di  binis ini,bagi aku adalah,bisa punya relasi dr kalangan pejabat sampe orang biasa..\nDan sharing pengalaman hidup mereka,yang dr bawah, sampe posisi mereka srkg...\n#Jadi bekerja sambil belajar guys\n\nIni yg aku temui satu jendral yg buat aku kagum lg...lagi ngobrol beliau nawarin makanan eh beliau  puasa  9\/10 muharram tasua\/assyura\n\nIni Pertama kali aku ktm klaen sejak pandemic..doakan guys...smg kalian jg pada sehat dan sukses ....\nAmin\n\nColek #PEPYLAZUARDY dan colek ad#nurhusnia \n\n#monirosa_ochaofficial\n#sukses \n#Bisnismilenial \n#bisnisdigital \n#Bisnisjamannow \n#MRT\n#mrtgroup\n#mrtl_kitasemuasaudara \n#asuransisyariah \n#ASURANSI \n#ASURANSIJIWA \n#Prudential \n#PRU\n#berkah \n#sukses \n#Bisnismilenial \n#bisnissyariah \n#pandemic \n#newnormal","NumberOfLikes":17,"Hashtags":["#Jadi","#PEPYLAZUARDY","#nurhusnia","#monirosa_ochaofficial","#sukses","#Bisnismilenial","#bisnisdigital","#Bisnisjamannow","#MRT","#mrtgroup","#mrtl_kitasemuasaudara","#asuransisyariah","#ASURANSI","#ASURANSIJIWA","#Prudential","#PRU","#berkah","#sukses","#Bisnismilenial","#bisnissyariah","#pandemic","#newnormal"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1598622224,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 28 15:43:44 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"meth.in.gaia","CaptionText":"#awakening #wakeup #openyoureyes #bastaya #stopcovid19 #noalnuevoordenmundial #yadespertamos #tiemposdecambio #killuminati #antiilluminati #illuminati #noalanuevanormalidad #losgobiernossontiteres #plandemia #miedovirus #circovirus #pandemic #falsapandemia #virusdelmiedo","NumberOfLikes":81,"Hashtags":["#awakening","#wakeup","#openyoureyes","#bastaya","#stopcovid19","#noalnuevoordenmundial","#yadespertamos","#tiemposdecambio","#killuminati","#antiilluminati","#illuminati","#noalanuevanormalidad","#losgobiernossontiteres","#plandemia","#miedovirus","#circovirus","#pandemic","#falsapandemia","#virusdelmiedo"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by METH on August 28, 2020.

I am Dr. Hina Talib, a teen doc & toddler mom here to help your tweens, teens and young adults who are coming of age during this pandemic. \u2009\n\u2009\nüë©üèª\u200D‚öïÔ∏èToday I teamed up with Evelyn from @myschoolpsychologist to bring you some practical tips for setting up remote learning for success. We hope you find them useful. Evelyn is also a mom & has been workshopping these tips with her own family & clients. \u2009\n\u2009\n‚úèÔ∏èFor some the emergency distance learning this Spring wet well, for many it had much room for improvement. Now is a perfect time to reflect and re-set (the 4th slide in the set above and my favorite) to think about what worked and problem-solve together with your teen on what everyone in the family can do to make small adjustments, just to see how it might help. \u2009\n\u2009\n‚úèÔ∏èImportantly for teens, helping them take the lead on some of these tips is key for building their own independence. \u2009\n\u2009\n‚úèÔ∏è\u2028A special nod to my patients with ADHD. Yes, remote learning can have unique challenges for these kids, but also I have found that I am learning some of the most useful practical tips from kids who know about focus-tricks! I have a special teen guest popping on my stories to share his top ADHD-remote learning tips later today - he is so brilliant, stay tuned. \u2009\n\u2009\nüë©üèª\u200DüíªI\u2019ve been thinking about why working from home\/learning from home is so much more taxing then in-person. The eye-strain, the lack of emotional cues when reading the room or \u201Cspeaking,\u201D and the delays in communication (texts, chat rooms and even speaking in a google classroom are just not at the speed and efficiency as in person). This is all quite a load. I feel it too during tele-health visits or zoom-marathon-meeting day. Breaks are essential. \u2009\n\u2009\nüëâüèºWhat are your favorite tips to help back-to-remote-school learners? The more creative & practical the better. Need some easy wins for everyone. \u2009\n\u2009\n‚ù§Ô∏èHave a wonderful weekend.

He made the call during a Webinar themed \u201CProspects of Non-Oil Export During and Post COVID-19\u201D organized by the bank on Wednesday, August 26, 2020.\n\nAccording to him, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic which has impacted the demand for oil and, by extension, the price of crude oil in the international commodities market has further exposed Nigeria\u2019s over-dependency on crude oil earnings and its susceptibility to oil-related shocks. He added that the events of the last couple of months have also highlighted the limited range of the country\u2019s value-added products exported to foreign markets.\n\nHe went on to note that boosting non-oil export is imperative in view of the opportunities that exist in the broader contexts of ECOWAS Trade Liberalisation Scheme and the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) which aims to create a continent-wide market of 1.2 billion people with combined Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of $2.5 trillion and about $4 trillion in consumer and business spending.\n\nHe commended the efforts of the government and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to deepen the non-oil export business in the country, Onyeagwu also urged players in the non-oil export value-chain including exporters and financial institutions to play their part in the drive towards expanding the nation\u2019s non-oil export base.\n\nDelivering the keynote address, the Director of Trade & Exchange, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Dr. (Mrs) Ozoemena Nnaji, who praised Zenith Bank for organizing the webinar at a time like this, observed that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is a wake-up call for the country, as it has once again exposed the over-dependence of the Nigerian economy on one product. She therefore called for a deeper policy look at the non-oil sector to find ways of genuinely improving the quality and quantity of our non-oil export goods.\n\n#zenith #zenithbank #covid19 #pandemic #pandemic","NumberOfLikes":0,"Hashtags":["#zenith","#zenithbank","#covid19","#pandemic","#pandemic"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Travis Media on August 28, 2020.

Toyota, which sold over 9.7 million vehicles in 2019, aims to boost its global sales of EVs including hybrid cars to 5.5 million units by 2025.\n\n...\nFollow us for more news & stories\n#japan #japanese #pandemic #theguildnews","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#japan","#japanese","#pandemic","#theguildnews"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The Guild Nigeria on August 28, 2020.

Concerns about Abe\u2019s health began this summer and grew this month when he visited a Tokyo hospital two weeks in a row for unspecified health checkups. He is now on a new treatment that requires IV injections, he said. While there is some improvement, there is no guarantee that it will cure his condition and so he decided to step down after treatment Monday, he said.He said his health problem was under control until earlier this year but was found to have relapsed in June when he had an annual checkup.\nAbe, whose term ends in September 2021, is expected to stay on until a new party leader is elected and formally approved by the parliament.\nAbe became Japan\u2019s youngest prime minister in 2006, at age 52, abruptly ended a year later because of his health.\nAfter his recent hospital visits were reported, top officials from Abe\u2019s Cabinet and the ruling party said he was overworked and badly needed rest.\nShigeru Ishiba, a 63-year-old hawkish former defense minister and Abe\u2019s archrival, is a favorite next leader in media surveys, though he is less popular within the governing party. A low-key former foreign minister, Fumio Kishida, Defense Minister Taro Kono, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, and economic revitalization minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, who is in charge of coronavirus measures, are widely mentioned in Japanese media as potential successors.\n\n#japan #tokyo #shinzoabe #health #pandemic #politics","NumberOfLikes":3,"Hashtags":["#japan","#tokyo","#shinzoabe","#health","#pandemic","#politics"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by NewsTerminus in Tokyo, Japan.

The photograph references were taken during a really difficult time, and drawing this has really helped me to try to process these emotions. I know the pandemic\/quarantine left many people feeling extremely isolated, hopeless, and desperately missing family and loved ones, me included. Add to that feeling like I totally failed at homeschooling, a very bored and hyper 5yo, my mother in law getting very ill and being separated from my partner for 5 months due to border closures (he's Finnish and I'm in the UK) put me in an extremely dark place. My partner is my home, my support and my safety, and not being able to hold each other and not knowing when we would was terrifying. The uncertainty of all that was happening, not knowing if the end was in sight caused such severe anxiety and panic attacks that the doctor put me on beta blockers because I literally couldn't calm myself down or ground myself. After my MIL passed, I decided to complete this drawing to help me cope with the grief. Everyone experiences loss in their lives but for those who have lost people during or because of this pandemic, my heart hurts for you. Not being able to attend funerals, or having to social distance from family when all you need is a hug or support is utter hell.

The world's reserve currency has entered a more persistent downtrend after an initial whipsaw on Thursday \u2013 responding to a dovish message from Jerome Powell, Chairman of the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe world's most powerful central banker laid down a new policy framework prioritizing reaching full employment at the expense of letting inflation overheat. Powell and his colleagues at the Fed will also allow consumer prices to exceed the 2% target for one year in order to compensate for past low inflation. \n\nInvestors hesitated at first, as price pressures are nowhere to be seen and the announcement was telegraphed in advance. However, while the news has no immediate policy implications \u2013 the Fed pledged low rates through 2022 \u2013 it implies lower borrowing costs for far longer. \nThursday's high volatility \u2013 a move of over 100 pips within a short time, made way for a consistent march to the upside for EUR\/USD. \n\nIn US politics, two weeks of party conference ended with President Donald Trump delivering a long acceptance speech. For markets, his words about ending reliance on China \"once and for all\" are of interest. Nevertheless, investors have shrugged off the bluster.\n\nOverall, several forces are set to shape trading, with echoes from Powell's speech likely to have the most dominant role. \n\nAll in all, bulls are in control.\nThe currency pair is challenging 1.19, Thursday's peak, and a round number. The next cap is close, 1.1915, which was a high point in early August. The two-year high of 1.1965 is next.\n\nSupport awaits at 1.1850, which held EUR\/USD down before the breakout, and it is followed by 1.18, which was a cushion last week. The next levels are 1.1755 and 1.17.\n \n#EURUSD #Forex #Trading #Technical #Analysis #Market #Fundamental #News #Pandemic #Covid19 #Chart  #Economy #Crisis #Interestrates","NumberOfLikes":16,"Hashtags":["#EURUSD","#Forex","#Trading","#Technical","#Analysis","#Market","#Fundamental","#News","#Pandemic","#Covid19","#Chart","#Economy","#Crisis","#Interestrates"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by THE FINANCIAL WAY on August 28, 2020.

Apasih Virtual Fashion Show itu? Virtual Fashion Show sama seperti fashion show pada umumnya, tetapi dilakukan secara virtual. Pandemi Covid-19 memberikan dampak yang besar bagi perekonomian Indonesia pada banyak sektor, tak terkecuali industri fashion Indonesia. Namun, dengan adanya pandemi ini bukan berarti menjadi penghalang untuk tidak melakukan apapun. Dengan berfikir kreatif dan adaptif, kita mampu untuk dapat memunculkan ide baru.\n----\nDengan memanfaatkan green screen atau layar hijau yang dilengkapi dengan visual digital, lighting yang cukup, dll virtual fashion show dapat berlangsung dengan menarik. Bisa dibuat dengan sederhana dari rumah atau studio yang memungkinkan para pelaku usaha fashion untuk bisa melakukan fashion show secara mandiri, sampai yang lebih bagus lagi dengan layanan live-streaming atau mengedit video semenarik mungkin sehingga semakin bisa menarik dan lebih dinikmati publik. \n----\nVirtual fashion show memiliki keuntungan yaitu dapat menghemat biaya bagi pihak penyelenggara yang dapat dilakukan dimana saja dan kapan saja tanpa membutuhkan area pagelaran yang luas. Di era new normal,  ini adalah kesempatan untuk pelaku usaha untuk bisa kreatif dan adaptif untuk lebih maksimal lagi dalam memasarkan produk.

All I remember is trying to escape with my mum and sister. I woke up in our neighbour's car with blood on my face and body. My children and I walked in search of a hospital, with many other wounded people around us, as if we were emerging from a bloody war.\n.\nSince that day, I wake up every morning thinking that what happened is nothing but a nightmare. I cannot believe it. My house is destroyed. And being an older woman in Lebanon, I barely have access to healthcare and have very few resources. I cannot afford to buy my medicines.

The fact that the world is in a never ending chaos maybe the answer to that; anxiety always kicks in. But did you know that there are many things that we have no control of whether we like it or not? And did you know that we have the choice to be swayed in the chaos or to stay sturdy during the storm? This one quote really speaks to me every time I am confused and in doubt: \u201Ceven the darkest hour only lasts 60 minutes\u201D. If we think about it, we can look to the chaos or look through it. \n.\nKeep calm. It may be gloomy today but it\u2019s not gonna be like that everyday. Easier said than done but we don\u2019t teach our minds to find that little piece of peace, that slight sight of hope, we\u2019ll lose it every time. \n.\nMaybe the answers to your peace is not in something, not around you, but within you.
