Naposledy jsem o tomhle psal v dřevním květnu 2020, kdy studie WHO spíše vyloučila údajné případy reaktivace v Jižní Koreji. Nyní ale máme první POTVRZENÝ případ tohoto druhu, ale... 😷\n\n2\u20E3 HONGKONGSKÝ PACIENT\nMožnost OPAKOVANÉ NÁKAZY se řešila od počátku pandemie. Z pohledu cynického vědátora platí, že VIRY POMĚRNĚ RYCHLE MUTUJÍ. Nemusí se jednat o mutace, které by měnily biologické vlastnosti viru, může se jednat o mutace neutrální, které nemění vůbec nic, případně mění vir jen poměrně málo. 🧬\n\nKdyž v Hong Kongu v srpnu přistál 33yo muž, který se vracel z Evropy, byl automaticky vyšetřen. Výsledek byl pozitivní. Záznamy ale ukázaly, ze už jednou se s COVIDem léčil, za zdravého byl UZNÁN V POLOVINĚ DUBNA. 👾\n\nProtože byly k dispozici vzorky z obou vyšetření, bylo by škoda nesrovnat sekvence virů. A ukázalo se, že vir z druhého záchytu má tolik různých změn, že POCHÁZÍ Z JINÉ LINIE než u viru z prvního záchytu. 👌\n\n1\u20E3 \u201EAHA, TAKŽE ZASE NIC NEVÍME?\u201C\nOd té doby se potvrdilo jen několik málo podobných případů, takže je BRZY VYVOZOVAT SILNÉ ZÁVĚRY. Dobrou zprávou je skutečnost, že hongkongský pacient NEMĚL ŽÁDNÉ PŘÍZNAKY. Kdyby nedošlo vlivem návratu ze zahraničí na otestování, nový koronavirus by u něj nebyl odhalen. 🤷\u200D♂️\n\nŠpatná zpráva je ale ta, že přirozená nákaza nejspíš nepovede k vytvoření skupinové imunity (#herdimmunity). To neznamená, že by se skupinová imunita vytvořit nemohla - ale bude dosažitelná jen očkováním. Což je pro mnohé jenom další dráždění hada bosou nohou. Nicméně, taková je realita. 🧪\n\nDefinitivní odpovědi nám tedy zatím stále unikají, a to je jistě výsledek, který jenom napomůže všeobecnému KLIDU A POHODĚ\u2026 😏\n\n#covid #corona #cororonavirus #pandemic #veda #science #věda #popularizace #epidemiology #virus #disease #wow #hongkong #china #sciencenews","NumberOfLikes":78,"Hashtags":["#COVID_19","#novinka","#herdimmunity).","#covid","#corona","#cororonavirus","#pandemic","#veda","#science","#věda","#popularizace","#epidemiology","#virus","#disease","#wow","#hongkong","#china","#sciencenews"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Vědátor on August 28, 2020.

Within those three words lies a complex web of partnerships, transactions, and logistics. It\u2019s a system that we \u2013 as restaurant-goers \u2013 have taken for granted because it seems to runs effortlessly in the background.\n.\nWith the arrival of COVID-19, our role as unconscious consumers has now come to an end because the systems we have relied on for so long are in jeopardy. Farmers are in trouble and, as you know, so are restaurants. So what\u2019s going on, exactly? How can we help? These questions, and more, were explored in the newest episode of the Food Under Fire podcast. I sat down with Tracy Singleton (owner of @birchwoodcafe in Minneapolis) and Gary Wertish (president of the @mnfarmersunion) to talk about the interrelationship between farms and restaurants and how that system \u2013 invisible to the eyes of consumers \u2013 is under threat.

I'm Amber, a Child and Family Therapist and mother of two. @connectwithplay is a page dedicated to the parent-child connection. \n\nExperts agree that when a caregiver is able to stay calm during stressful interactions with their child(ren), this will in turn promote self-regulation, a positive sense of self and better mental health overall for the child. \n\nThe issue a lot of us face is the fact that attachment relationships can bring out all of our raw emotions and unmet needs from our own childhood. We can be completely regulated at work and in the community, but lose our control with the people who are closest to us. So, please know that we've all been in a spot where we have lost control as parents. \n\nWhat I always see in parenting information is practical scripts (love these) and relaxation exercises, which is helpful, but if we are coming from a place of unmet needs, we also may not have recieved the skills to really regulate ourselves. Instead we may be continuing the trend of internalizing our emotions. Just as children can only do well with the skills they have, parents can only do their best with the skills they have. \n\nThis post speaks to those skills we may not be using in those difficult moments. It is simply to help provide more in depth way of tending  to ourselves in order to help our child.  Like with any skill, it will take practice. The best thing we can do is keep trying. \n\nPlease let me know if this information helps you. Even if one slide assists you in gaining more peace, it will be worth the effort it took to create this for you.

Direktur Surabaya Survey Center (SSC) Mochtar W Oetomo menilai molornya rekomendasi salah satunya karena power Tri Rismaharini.\n\n.\n\"Saya rasa sangat wajar ada power dari Bu Risma. Karena kompetisi perebutan rekomendasi ini juga direbutkan oleh power politik lain di luar Bu Risma yang akhirnya DPP jadi harus mempertimbangkan dua kali untuk mengumumkan nama calon. Tapi enaknya saya sebut bukan power, tapi faksi politik,\" kata Mochtar saat dikonfirmasi detikcom, Jumat (28\/8\/2020).\n\n.\nMochtar menjelaskan 3 faksi atau power tersebut adalah faksi Risma, Faksi Bambang DH dan Faksi Whisnu Sakti Buana. Faksi Risma sudah terlihat mengarah ke tiga nama yakni Eri Cahyadi, Armuji hingga putra sulungnya sendiri, Fuad Bernadi.\n\n.\n\"Karena kekuatan faksi Risma ini juga gak bisa disepelekan. Melihat kesuksesan Risma dalam memimpin Surabaya selama 2 periode kan jadi pertimbangan besar.

Fallout 4!\n\nFallout 4 is an action role-playing game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks. It is the fourth main game in the Fallout series. The game is set within an open world post-apocalyptic environment that encompasses the city of Boston and the surrounding Massachusetts region known as \"The Commonwealth\". It makes use of a number of local landmarks, including Bunker Hill, Fort Independence (Massachusetts), and Old North Bridge near Concord, as the bridge out of Sanctuary Hills. The main story takes place in the year 2287, ten years after the events of Fallout 3 and 210 years after \"The Great War\", which caused catastrophic nuclear devastation across the United States.\n\nThe player assumes control of a character referred to as the \"Sole Survivor\", who emerges from a long-term cryogenic stasis in Vault 111, an underground nuclear fallout shelter. After witnessing the murder of their spouse and kidnapping of their son, the Sole Survivor ventures out into the Commonwealth to search for their missing child. The player explores the game's dilapidated world, completes various quests, helps out factions, and acquires experience points to level up and increase the abilities of their character. New features to the series include the ability to develop and manage settlements and an extensive crafting system where materials scavenged from the environment can be used to craft drugs and explosives, upgrade weapons and armor, and construct, furnish and improve settlements. Fallout 4 also marks the first game in the series to feature full voice acting for the protagonist.\n#fallout \n#wearamask #masks #maske #prayers #salvation #socxplosion #playstation #maskup #forgiveness #masked #mascarillas #apocalypse #mask #facemaskselfie #videogames #portraitinspiration #trustgod #virus #godlovesyou #protectyourself #maskon #brunchlife #quarantine2020 #masks4all #portraitgames #sundaybrunch #wearmask #socks #pandemic","NumberOfLikes":62,"Hashtags":["#fallout","#wearamask","#masks","#maske","#prayers","#salvation","#socxplosion","#playstation","#maskup","#forgiveness","#masked","#mascarillas","#apocalypse","#mask","#facemaskselfie","#videogames","#portraitinspiration","#trustgod","#virus","#godlovesyou","#protectyourself","#maskon","#brunchlife","#quarantine2020","#masks4all","#portraitgames","#sundaybrunch","#wearmask","#socks","#pandemic"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Steven Bonanno on August 28, 2020.","NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1598622265,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 28 15:44:25 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"cassiopeia_ltd","CaptionText":"@clp_react_and_protect CYBER FORENSICS, LAW & PR SERVICES\n\nCLP React & Protect provide a comprehensive services to deal with legal, forensic & PR requirements for range of cyber security & data breach incidents.\n\n▪ CYBER SECURITY & DIGITAL FORENSICS\n\n▪ BUSINESS EMPLOYMENT LAW\n\n▪ REGULATORY LAW\n\n▪ LITIGATION\n\n▪ PR & REPUTATION MANAGMENT\n.\n.\n.\n#cybersecurity #settlement #privacy #security #cyber #informationsecurity #databreach #dataprotection #datasecurity #gdpr #legal #lawyer #compliance #management #help #digital #pr #react #clp #Cassiopeia #CLP #Coronavirus #Pandemic #misconduct #employmentlaws #regulatorylaw #regulators #digitalforensics #PR #reputationmanagment","NumberOfLikes":3,"Hashtags":["#cybersecurity","#settlement","#privacy","#security","#cyber","#informationsecurity","#databreach","#dataprotection","#datasecurity","#gdpr","#legal","#lawyer","#compliance","#management","#help","#digital","#pr","#react","#clp","#Cassiopeia","#CLP","#Coronavirus","#Pandemic","#misconduct","#employmentlaws","#regulatorylaw","#regulators","#digitalforensics","#PR","#reputationmanagment"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598622225,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 28 15:43:45 CEST 2020","Location":"London, United Kingdom"},{"Owner":"monirosa_ochaofficial","CaptionText":"Ini bisnisku guys\n\nHappynya di  binis ini,bagi aku adalah,bisa punya relasi dr kalangan pejabat sampe orang biasa..\nDan sharing pengalaman hidup mereka,yang dr bawah, sampe posisi mereka srkg...\n#Jadi bekerja sambil belajar guys\n\nIni yg aku temui satu jendral yg buat aku kagum lg...lagi ngobrol beliau nawarin makanan eh beliau  puasa  9\/10 muharram tasua\/assyura\n\nIni Pertama kali aku ktm klaen sejak pandemic..doakan guys...smg kalian jg pada sehat dan sukses ....\nAmin\n\nColek #PEPYLAZUARDY dan colek ad#nurhusnia \n\n#monirosa_ochaofficial\n#sukses \n#Bisnismilenial \n#bisnisdigital \n#Bisnisjamannow \n#MRT\n#mrtgroup\n#mrtl_kitasemuasaudara \n#asuransisyariah \n#ASURANSI \n#ASURANSIJIWA \n#Prudential \n#PRU\n#berkah \n#sukses \n#Bisnismilenial \n#bisnissyariah \n#pandemic \n#newnormal","NumberOfLikes":17,"Hashtags":["#Jadi","#PEPYLAZUARDY","#nurhusnia","#monirosa_ochaofficial","#sukses","#Bisnismilenial","#bisnisdigital","#Bisnisjamannow","#MRT","#mrtgroup","#mrtl_kitasemuasaudara","#asuransisyariah","#ASURANSI","#ASURANSIJIWA","#Prudential","#PRU","#berkah","#sukses","#Bisnismilenial","#bisnissyariah","#pandemic","#newnormal"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1598622224,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 28 15:43:44 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"meth.in.gaia","CaptionText":"#awakening #wakeup #openyoureyes #bastaya #stopcovid19 #noalnuevoordenmundial #yadespertamos #tiemposdecambio #killuminati #antiilluminati #illuminati #noalanuevanormalidad #losgobiernossontiteres #plandemia #miedovirus #circovirus #pandemic #falsapandemia #virusdelmiedo","NumberOfLikes":81,"Hashtags":["#awakening","#wakeup","#openyoureyes","#bastaya","#stopcovid19","#noalnuevoordenmundial","#yadespertamos","#tiemposdecambio","#killuminati","#antiilluminati","#illuminati","#noalanuevanormalidad","#losgobiernossontiteres","#plandemia","#miedovirus","#circovirus","#pandemic","#falsapandemia","#virusdelmiedo"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by METH on August 28, 2020.

I am Dr. Hina Talib, a teen doc & toddler mom here to help your tweens, teens and young adults who are coming of age during this pandemic. \u2009\n\u2009\n👩🏻\u200D⚕️Today I teamed up with Evelyn from @myschoolpsychologist to bring you some practical tips for setting up remote learning for success. We hope you find them useful. Evelyn is also a mom & has been workshopping these tips with her own family & clients. \u2009\n\u2009\n✏️For some the emergency distance learning this Spring wet well, for many it had much room for improvement. Now is a perfect time to reflect and re-set (the 4th slide in the set above and my favorite) to think about what worked and problem-solve together with your teen on what everyone in the family can do to make small adjustments, just to see how it might help. \u2009\n\u2009\n✏️Importantly for teens, helping them take the lead on some of these tips is key for building their own independence. \u2009\n\u2009\n✏️\u2028A special nod to my patients with ADHD. Yes, remote learning can have unique challenges for these kids, but also I have found that I am learning some of the most useful practical tips from kids who know about focus-tricks! I have a special teen guest popping on my stories to share his top ADHD-remote learning tips later today - he is so brilliant, stay tuned. \u2009\n\u2009\n👩🏻\u200D💻I\u2019ve been thinking about why working from home\/learning from home is so much more taxing then in-person. The eye-strain, the lack of emotional cues when reading the room or \u201Cspeaking,\u201D and the delays in communication (texts, chat rooms and even speaking in a google classroom are just not at the speed and efficiency as in person). This is all quite a load. I feel it too during tele-health visits or zoom-marathon-meeting day. Breaks are essential. \u2009\n\u2009\n👉🏼What are your favorite tips to help back-to-remote-school learners? The more creative & practical the better. Need some easy wins for everyone. \u2009\n\u2009\n❤️Have a wonderful weekend.

He made the call during a Webinar themed \u201CProspects of Non-Oil Export During and Post COVID-19\u201D organized by the bank on Wednesday, August 26, 2020.\n\nAccording to him, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic which has impacted the demand for oil and, by extension, the price of crude oil in the international commodities market has further exposed Nigeria\u2019s over-dependency on crude oil earnings and its susceptibility to oil-related shocks. He added that the events of the last couple of months have also highlighted the limited range of the country\u2019s value-added products exported to foreign markets.\n\nHe went on to note that boosting non-oil export is imperative in view of the opportunities that exist in the broader contexts of ECOWAS Trade Liberalisation Scheme and the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) which aims to create a continent-wide market of 1.2 billion people with combined Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of $2.5 trillion and about $4 trillion in consumer and business spending.\n\nHe commended the efforts of the government and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to deepen the non-oil export business in the country, Onyeagwu also urged players in the non-oil export value-chain including exporters and financial institutions to play their part in the drive towards expanding the nation\u2019s non-oil export base.\n\nDelivering the keynote address, the Director of Trade & Exchange, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Dr. (Mrs) Ozoemena Nnaji, who praised Zenith Bank for organizing the webinar at a time like this, observed that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is a wake-up call for the country, as it has once again exposed the over-dependence of the Nigerian economy on one product. She therefore called for a deeper policy look at the non-oil sector to find ways of genuinely improving the quality and quantity of our non-oil export goods.\n\n#zenith #zenithbank #covid19 #pandemic #pandemic","NumberOfLikes":0,"Hashtags":["#zenith","#zenithbank","#covid19","#pandemic","#pandemic"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Travis Media on August 28, 2020.

Toyota, which sold over 9.7 million vehicles in 2019, aims to boost its global sales of EVs including hybrid cars to 5.5 million units by 2025.\n\n...\nFollow us for more news & stories\n#japan #japanese #pandemic #theguildnews","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#japan","#japanese","#pandemic","#theguildnews"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by The Guild Nigeria on August 28, 2020.

Concerns about Abe\u2019s health began this summer and grew this month when he visited a Tokyo hospital two weeks in a row for unspecified health checkups. He is now on a new treatment that requires IV injections, he said. While there is some improvement, there is no guarantee that it will cure his condition and so he decided to step down after treatment Monday, he said.He said his health problem was under control until earlier this year but was found to have relapsed in June when he had an annual checkup.\nAbe, whose term ends in September 2021, is expected to stay on until a new party leader is elected and formally approved by the parliament.\nAbe became Japan\u2019s youngest prime minister in 2006, at age 52, abruptly ended a year later because of his health.\nAfter his recent hospital visits were reported, top officials from Abe\u2019s Cabinet and the ruling party said he was overworked and badly needed rest.\nShigeru Ishiba, a 63-year-old hawkish former defense minister and Abe\u2019s archrival, is a favorite next leader in media surveys, though he is less popular within the governing party. A low-key former foreign minister, Fumio Kishida, Defense Minister Taro Kono, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, and economic revitalization minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, who is in charge of coronavirus measures, are widely mentioned in Japanese media as potential successors.\n\n#japan #tokyo #shinzoabe #health #pandemic #politics","NumberOfLikes":3,"Hashtags":["#japan","#tokyo","#shinzoabe","#health","#pandemic","#politics"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by NewsTerminus in Tokyo, Japan.

The photograph references were taken during a really difficult time, and drawing this has really helped me to try to process these emotions. I know the pandemic\/quarantine left many people feeling extremely isolated, hopeless, and desperately missing family and loved ones, me included. Add to that feeling like I totally failed at homeschooling, a very bored and hyper 5yo, my mother in law getting very ill and being separated from my partner for 5 months due to border closures (he's Finnish and I'm in the UK) put me in an extremely dark place. My partner is my home, my support and my safety, and not being able to hold each other and not knowing when we would was terrifying. The uncertainty of all that was happening, not knowing if the end was in sight caused such severe anxiety and panic attacks that the doctor put me on beta blockers because I literally couldn't calm myself down or ground myself. After my MIL passed, I decided to complete this drawing to help me cope with the grief. Everyone experiences loss in their lives but for those who have lost people during or because of this pandemic, my heart hurts for you. Not being able to attend funerals, or having to social distance from family when all you need is a hug or support is utter hell. Love to all that are dealing with the loss of a loved one and to those coping with mental health issues for whatever reason 🖤\n.\n.\n.\n#mentalheath #mentalhealthmatters #mentalhealthawareness #drawing #draw #pencildrawing #pencil #art #artist #artwork #craft #crafter #crafting #crafts #depression #anxiety #loss #grief #lossofalovedone #covid19 #coronavirus #pandemic #lockdown #therapy #ThisIsUs #LoveIsEssential #LoveIsNotTourism #portrait #portraiture #selfportrait","NumberOfLikes":9,"Hashtags":["#mentalheath","#mentalhealthmatters","#mentalhealthawareness","#drawing","#draw","#pencildrawing","#pencil","#art","#artist","#artwork","#craft","#crafter","#crafting","#crafts","#depression","#anxiety","#loss","#grief","#lossofalovedone","#covid19","#coronavirus","#pandemic","#lockdown","#therapy","#ThisIsUs","#LoveIsEssential","#LoveIsNotTourism","#portrait","#portraiture","#selfportrait"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Agnythe - Doll Artist🧸 on August 28, 2020.

President Director PT Suzuki Indomobil Motor\/PT Suzuki Indomobil Sales Seiji Itayama menuturkan keputusan ini dimulai sejak 24 Agustus 2020 terkait antisipasi pencegahan COVID-19 pasca temuan 71 karyawan mereka positif COVID-19.\n\nIa bilang Suzuki melakukan pengurangan kapasitas produksi pabrik sebanyak 50% dari kondisi normal. Pengurangan kapasitas produksi kali ini dilakukan di pabrik\nlokasi perakitan sepeda motor.\n\n\"Kami sangat concern mengenai kesehatan karyawan. Meskipun kami sudah menerapkan protokol pencegahan penyebaran COVID-19 dengan ketat, penularan tersebut tidak bisa dihindari. Untuk itu, pengurangan kapasitas produksi harus dilakukan untuk memutus rantai penyebaran virus tersebut,\" kata Itayama dalam keterangan resmi Jumat (28\/8).\n\nSebanyak 71 karyawan Suzuki saat ini sedang menjalani karantina mandiri dan beberapa di antaranya mendapatkan perawatan di rumah sakit. Akibat kejadian ini, Suzuki mengambil sejumlah tindakan yang direkomendasikan tim Gugus Tugas COVID-19.\n\nUpaya-upaya tersebut di antaranya adalah melakukan PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) test terhadap semua karyawan yang memiliki riwayat interaksi dengan karyawan yang terpapar dan rapid test kepada seluruh karyawan Suzuki lainnya.\n\nArea pabrik dan kantor dibersihkan dan disemprot cairan disinfektan secara berkala. Tak ketinggalan, kendaraan-kendaraan yang selesai dirakit pun dibersihkan dan didisinfektan sebelum dikirim ke pelanggan, yang mana hal ini merupakan prosedur Suzuki yang sudah dilakukan dari dulu sebelum adanya pandemi.\n\n#WorldHealthOrganization #CoronavirusPandemic #CoronaPandemic #COVIDPandemic #COVID19 #Coronavirus #COVID19Pandemic #WHOSwitzerland #WHOIndonesia #WHOInternational #CoronavirusDisease2019 #Pandemic #GlobalPandemic #CNBCIndonesia #PandemiCorona #PandemiKorona #PandemiCOVID19 #MediaLawanCOVID19 #BersamaLawanCorona #LawanCorona #MediaPemersatuBangsa #KnowledgeToElevate #IndonesiaMelawanCOVID19 #IniBaruTRANS7 #TVRI #MetroTV #TRANS7","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#WorldHealthOrganization","#CoronavirusPandemic","#CoronaPandemic","#COVIDPandemic","#COVID19","#Coronavirus","#COVID19Pandemic","#WHOSwitzerland","#WHOIndonesia","#WHOInternational","#CoronavirusDisease2019","#Pandemic","#GlobalPandemic","#CNBCIndonesia","#PandemiCorona","#PandemiKorona","#PandemiCOVID19","#MediaLawanCOVID19","#BersamaLawanCorona","#LawanCorona","#MediaPemersatuBangsa","#KnowledgeToElevate","#IndonesiaMelawanCOVID19","#IniBaruTRANS7","#TVRI","#MetroTV","#TRANS7"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Yoga-kun in CNN Indonesia with @who, @officialtrans7, @telkomindonesia, @bni46, @whophilippines, @cnnindonesia, @suzuki_id, @detikcom, @metrotv, @dtpnetid, @tvrinasional, @transvisionid, @cnnidpr, @suzukiindonesiamotor, @precure_curesta, @cnbcindonesia, @transmediajabar, @whoindonesia, @who.searo, and @moratelindo.

The world's reserve currency has entered a more persistent downtrend after an initial whipsaw on Thursday \u2013 responding to a dovish message from Jerome Powell, Chairman of the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe world's most powerful central banker laid down a new policy framework prioritizing reaching full employment at the expense of letting inflation overheat. Powell and his colleagues at the Fed will also allow consumer prices to exceed the 2% target for one year in order to compensate for past low inflation. \n\nInvestors hesitated at first, as price pressures are nowhere to be seen and the announcement was telegraphed in advance. However, while the news has no immediate policy implications \u2013 the Fed pledged low rates through 2022 \u2013 it implies lower borrowing costs for far longer. \nThursday's high volatility \u2013 a move of over 100 pips within a short time, made way for a consistent march to the upside for EUR\/USD. \n\nIn US politics, two weeks of party conference ended with President Donald Trump delivering a long acceptance speech. For markets, his words about ending reliance on China \"once and for all\" are of interest. Nevertheless, investors have shrugged off the bluster.\n\nOverall, several forces are set to shape trading, with echoes from Powell's speech likely to have the most dominant role. \n\nAll in all, bulls are in control.\nThe currency pair is challenging 1.19, Thursday's peak, and a round number. The next cap is close, 1.1915, which was a high point in early August. The two-year high of 1.1965 is next.\n\nSupport awaits at 1.1850, which held EUR\/USD down before the breakout, and it is followed by 1.18, which was a cushion last week.

Apasih Virtual Fashion Show itu? Virtual Fashion Show sama seperti fashion show pada umumnya, tetapi dilakukan secara virtual. Pandemi Covid-19 memberikan dampak yang besar bagi perekonomian Indonesia pada banyak sektor, tak terkecuali industri fashion Indonesia. Namun, dengan adanya pandemi ini bukan berarti menjadi penghalang untuk tidak melakukan apapun. Dengan berfikir kreatif dan adaptif, kita mampu untuk dapat memunculkan ide baru.\n----\nDengan memanfaatkan green screen atau layar hijau yang dilengkapi dengan visual digital, lighting yang cukup, dll virtual fashion show dapat berlangsung dengan menarik. Bisa dibuat dengan sederhana dari rumah atau studio yang memungkinkan para pelaku usaha fashion untuk bisa melakukan fashion show secara mandiri, sampai yang lebih bagus lagi dengan layanan live-streaming atau mengedit video semenarik mungkin sehingga semakin bisa menarik dan lebih dinikmati publik. \n----\nVirtual fashion show memiliki keuntungan yaitu dapat menghemat biaya bagi pihak penyelenggara yang dapat dilakukan dimana saja dan kapan saja tanpa membutuhkan area pagelaran yang luas. Di era new normal,  ini adalah kesempatan untuk pelaku usaha untuk bisa kreatif dan adaptif untuk lebih maksimal lagi dalam memasarkan produk. Tetapi, tantangannya juga lebih banyak, karena semua persiapan dan komunikasi dikerjakan dari rumah, lewat video call misalnya dan juga berfikir bagaimana cara mengemas dan menyajikannya ke publik sehingga bisa diterima dengan baik.\n----\nSemua produk kami bisa didapatkan di berbagai marketplace. Seperti Blibli, Tokopedia, Shopee, zilingotrade.id dan masih banyak lagi.

And did you know that we have the choice to be swayed in the chaos or to stay sturdy during the storm? This one quote really speaks to me every time I am confused and in doubt: \u201Ceven the darkest hour only lasts 60 minutes\u201D.
