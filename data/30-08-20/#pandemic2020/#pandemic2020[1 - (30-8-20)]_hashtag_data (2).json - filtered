Whaaaat!\n\nThe other night, I took a bath - BY MYSELF - for the first time since before my son was born. I had a few minutes of calm and quiet in the bathroom, and I noticed that there were holes in the wall above my toilet. Those holes have been there for a year, so when I say 'noticed' you might be wondering what's up?! I mean, I'm in my bathroom multiple times a day, right? \n\nThe day we brought my son home from the hospital, one year + five days ago, the bathroom shelf fell off the wall and smashed our toilet in half, flooding the bathroom and causing all sorts of mayhem.\n\nWe cleaned up the mess, got a new toilet installed and moved the shelf into the basement, with every intention of getting some new hardware to re-install that thing SECURELY.\n\nAnd the shelf is still in the basement, and the holes are still in my wall. And it's been a year and I really only noticed it the other night (this story is going somewhere - I promise!).\n\nI've had a tough week, and one of the things I've been grappling with is the fact that it's been a year since I started taking meds for anxiety and depression, and I'm still struggling with my mental health. I mean, it's been a year, shouldn't I be 'better'?\n\nAnd then looking at those damn holes last night, I realized - I fixed the toilet because it was ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY but I put off fixing the wall because it just wasn't a priority. After awhile, the broken state of things just started to seem normal, so much that I stopped thinking about fixing it all together.\n\nAnd this is how I've approached my self-care in the past year. I've done what's absolutely necessary to stay alive and functioning(ish), but I haven't taken the time to fix the holes and rebuild what has fallen apart. I haven't even really NOTICED what needs fixing.\n\nI'm not sure if I'm the toilet or the wall or what in this story, but I know the time has come to start doing more than the bare minimum for myself. \n\nI'm going to make September a month to start over with self-care.\n\nWanna join me?","NumberOfLikes":17,"Hashtags":["#selfcare"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Self-care for moms on August 29, 2020.","NumberOfComments":11,"Timestamp":1598729214,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 29 21:26:54 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"spadge64","CaptionText":"My rainbow stay safe sign in the window had faded a lot since March.

Of all the tragedies occurring in the world and our country, postponing our nuptials is really no sacrifice. In fact, in some ways, it has been a gift. I mean, the greatest relationship litmus test is to quarantine with someone during a pandemic. You will definitely know if they are the right one for you.\n\nI have been lucky enough to be able to grow more and more in love with my best friend during this uninterrupted, focused time together. It has brought me an even deeper understanding of the man that he is at his core and, my goodness, is he spectacular. In the times I didn\u2019t think I could smile, he made me find uncontrollable laughter that made my sides sore. When I cried harder than I ever had in my life, he was there to hold my hand, rub my back, listen and just be present with an open heart. Together, we have grown as better communicators and partners within our relationship and also as better humans within the world. \n\nWhen that special day does finally arrive, I believe that the postponement of our wedding will only strengthen our marriage.

A jinx year, as commonly called by almost every other human being on earth now, has really been the toughest year after almost a century, not only for humans and also the wild animals in surviving different parts of the world. What not have we seen since the onset of this year forest fires, cyclones, earthquakes, blasts, flood, and not to mention #covid19.\n\nJust like all of you, i too faced the same issues and went through the same mental turmoil during this #pandemic. But yes i dealt with them more sportingly and confidently because there had been more difficult situations in the past which i had dealt single handedly. Hence the patience, courage, experience and strength were already there but now it got doubled and made it easier for me to face the upcoming challenges.\n\nBut leaving  aside all this worries and hardship stories, let me just tell you all few positive changes that i experienced during this lockdown days. \n\n1. I was literally stuck in few critical situations of life and used to blame god or time for being so tough upon me but i realised it's my indecisiveness and fear which was forbidding me to take the leap.\n\n2. I obviously became more alert about my physical and mental well being and health. Learnt to inhale positivity and exhale positivity too. \n\n3. Increased my knowledge in various fields, starting from learning new recipes to enrolling myself to some fine IT skills courses too. \n\n4. And last but not the least spent priceless moments and made innumerable memories with my chotu champ.. My lill sweetheart Hridan.\n\nSo overall i have taken this whole lockdown thing in a very motivating way not forgetting the fact that our world is fighting a tough battle, each day with this alien virus. \n\nI just pray and pray and pray that it ends asap and we all regain our normal lives.  And would like to thanks my family and friends for being a major support throughout. \nBut please i request everyone maintain all the basic precautions and do not be liberal with this virus. Take proper care of yourself and your family. Be safe, alert and healthy. \n\nAll my love and good wishes to everyone. \nKarishma Singh. \n\n#pandemic2020 #covid19  #makeoverlifestylestories","NumberOfLikes":8,"Hashtags":["#covid19.","#pandemic.","#pandemic2020","#covid19","#makeoverlifestylestories"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Makeover, Lifestyle, Stories on August 29, 2020.

There are the individual losses and painful transitions that we each experience. But there are also larger-scale community and societal experiences of grief. \n\nThink about abandoned factories and shuttered businesses and their impact on employees and their families: loss of jobs, finanical precarity, possible loss of health insurance, exponential levels of stress, and fear of the future. And imagine how this disappointment, fear, and stress ripples out from individual homes to impact a town or city. Grief resides here.\n\nOr consider the mental, emotional, and physical toll of the Covid-19 crisis. There are the terrible losses of individual lives (which, by one count, currently stands at a staggering 836,000+ worldwide). Then the are the crises in political leadership and communication laid bare by this pandemic. And the fear and anxiety swirling around communities concerning job security, schooling, healthcare, et al. Grief resides here.\n\nAs we mark National Grief Awareness Day (August 30), we invite you to consider the ways in which your life intersects with communities around you. If you are fortunate to not (yet) directly experience any loss, why not strengthen your empathetic muscles by imagining the grief of those around you? If you - like so many of us - know grief all too well, then, perhaps you can tap into the strength and resilience of those in your community who use their grief to extend a compassionate hand of support to others.\n\n#griefandloss #griefawareness #griefawarenessday #nationalgriefawarenessday2020 #seegrief #seegriefdifferently #communitygrief #communalgrief #societalgrief #griefandpain #pandemicgrief #pandemic2020 #communitystrength #communityresilience #communityhope #strongertogether #rebuildtheworld #supportingothers #healingtogether #neighborhood #caringforothers #compassionateliving #compassionateteaching #griefeducation #griefeducators #socialjusticeeducation #griefandlosssupport #griefsupport #grievingtogether #griefworkers","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#griefandloss","#griefawareness","#griefawarenessday","#nationalgriefawarenessday2020","#seegrief","#seegriefdifferently","#communitygrief","#communalgrief","#societalgrief","#griefandpain","#pandemicgrief","#pandemic2020","#communitystrength","#communityresilience","#communityhope","#strongertogether","#rebuildtheworld","#supportingothers","#healingtogether","#neighborhood","#caringforothers","#compassionateliving","#compassionateteaching","#griefeducation","#griefeducators","#socialjusticeeducation","#griefandlosssupport","#griefsupport","#grievingtogether","#griefworkers"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Inviting Abundance on August 29, 2020.

Tapi kali ini, aku mau bicara tentang not *trying* to find meaning (yet).\n\nIde ini muncul dari salah satu pertanyaan dalam diskusi UNITY Book Club (hi, there @unity_4mentalhealth and @minatbakat.unity üëãüèº) Bukankah merenung dan mencari makna itu melelahkan? Apakah kita HARUS mencari makna dari segala sesuatu?\n\nWell I\u2019d say: not always. Ada kalanya emosi kita sedang meluap-luap, dan begitu overwhelming sehingga kita sulit berpikir, apalagi merenung dalam-dalam. In that case, it is much better to let your mind stay in the present moment. Fokuslah mengerjakan rutinitas sehari-hari. Tapi kalau biasanya kita beraktivitas seraya pikiran melanglang buana, kali ini fokuskan seluruh pikiran dan perhatian kita ke kegiatan right here right now. Yes, sesederhana apapun kegiatan itu. Instead of trying to find meaning, try to follow the natural rhythm of every day, even the natural flow of your breath. \n\nKetika emosi yang tidak menyenangkan sedang membanjirimu, tarik napas dalam dan lambat. Sayangi otakmu dengan memberinya banyak oksigen. Penuhi pancaindramu dengan hal-hal indah: semerbak biji kopi, pemandangan hijau, gemericik air, setetes madu di ujung lidah, sentuhan bunga liar di pinggir jalan. Love yourself enough so that you can simply exist.\n\nMeaning will find you later. üíö\n\n\u2014\n\u201CHappiness cannot be pursued; it must ensue.\u201D\n(Viktor Frankl)\n\u2014\n\n#mentalhealthawareness #sehatjiwa #depression #depresi #anxiety #hope #mentalhealth #covid19 #pandemic2020 #liveandletlive #succulents #succulentsofinstagram #mindfulness #mindful #mindfulliving #makingbetterchoices #psikologi","NumberOfLikes":37,"Hashtags":["#mentalhealthawareness","#sehatjiwa","#depression","#depresi","#anxiety","#hope","#mentalhealth","#covid19","#pandemic2020","#liveandletlive","#succulents","#succulentsofinstagram","#mindfulness","#mindful","#mindfulliving","#makingbetterchoices","#psikologi"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Anna Elissa, OP in Bogor, Indonesia.

So when I got the chance to re-do my room to accommodate a workspace, I grabbed it with both hands and ran with what I had. \n\nIt\u2019s tricky to get the home office right. Even more when it\u2019s the first time. A lot of things come into play - the desk height, the comfort of the chair, space to store work essentials etc. If you aren\u2019t careful, you would miss something or the other. Covering up the mistakes with a second batch of modifications becomes hard on the pocket because it\u2019s already expensive the first time.\n\nSo on the blog, I have shared my experience of setting up a home office along with product sources, reviews and total cost in the hope that it helps someone in a similar situation.

This place had a magical effect on me.

But as we kept driving up we couldn't see more than 25 feet in front of us. It was super windy and temps dropped in the 50s. The top was a rocky dry barren land. Very otherworldly and not being able to see the valley below it just really didn't matter. I felt like a child wanting to play hide and seek and disappear into the cloud. Shapes would come out of the fog and dissapear again as soon as the winds changed direction. You could hear other people voices but you were not sure where they were coming from. How insignificant the pretty  views of the valley below seemed compare to the power of wild unpredictable weather up here. Definitely a place to visit again.\n.\n.\n.\n#landscape #forest #wildnature #trees #greenery #fog #mountain #art #fineart #mountainlife #clouds #photographyinpandemic #nature #conceptual #sonyalpha #sonyphotography #pandemic2020 #mountainview #fineartphotography #pandemiclife #mountwashington #newhampshire #mountaintop  #landscapephotography #wildforest #naturelover #sanctuary #forestry #mysanctuaryseries.","NumberOfLikes":44,"Hashtags":["#landscape","#forest","#wildnature","#trees","#greenery","#fog","#mountain","#art","#fineart","#mountainlife","#clouds","#photographyinpandemic","#nature","#conceptual","#sonyalpha","#sonyphotography","#pandemic2020","#mountainview","#fineartphotography","#pandemiclife","#mountwashington","#newhampshire","#mountaintop","#landscapephotography","#wildforest","#naturelover","#sanctuary","#forestry","#mysanctuaryseries."],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Poppy on August 28, 2020.

Believe it or not, nearly 40 years ago the cult classic \u201CGrease 2\u201D rama-lama-lama-ka-dinga-da-ding-dong\u2019d its way onto the silver screen. To kick off the weekend, today\u2019s stop on my pandemic Hollywood tour is the burger joint featured in the film! \n\n\u201CGrease 2\u201D is a sequel to the 1978 film \u201CGrease.\u201D It takes place two years after the original film at Rydell High School, set in the 1961\u20131962 school year, with an almost entirely new cast, led by actors Maxwell Caulfield and Michelle Pfeiffer in her first starring role.\n\nIn the film, Michael Carrington (Maxwell Caulfield) tutored Stephanie Zinone (Michelle Pfeiffer) over a hamburger (with extra ketchup!) at the local burger joint. In real life, this 50\u2019s style eatery is called Cadillac Jack\u2019s Diner and it was built in 1949. \n\nOriginally named the Pink Cafe, the diner is no longer a working restaurant. It stopped serving food in 1989 and is exclusively a filming set that production companies rent out. Cadillac Jack\u2019s Diner is located at \u202A9457 San Fernando Road in Sun Valley\u202C, CA. \n\nThis diner has appeared in numerous movies and TV shows including The House of Sand and Fog, High Road, and Pirates of Silicon Valley, as well as in episodes of Columbo, Las Vegas, Highway to Heaven, Murder, She Wrote, Law & Order, and Simon & Simon. Recently, the locale has been used in many music videos including Mandy Moore\u2019s Candy, Cee Lo Green\u2019s Forget You, ¬†Hailey Reinhart\u2019s Free, and Christina Aguilera\u2019s Your Body videos.\n\nFun facts - The pink cabinet outside of the Diner, that Johnny and Goose knee and punch, was made specifically for the film and was not a part of Cadillac Jack's, where the scene was filmed.\n\nReportedly, Maxwell Caulfield won the lead male role over Shaun Cassidy, Greg Evigan, Andy Gibb, and Rick Springfield.\n\nLisa Hartman, Kristy McNichol, Andrea McArdle and Pat Benatar were considered for the role of Stephanie Zinone. Michelle Pfeiffer was a wild card choice, but according to Patricia Birch, she won the part because she \u201Chas a quirky quality you don\u2019t expect.\" #filminglocation  #grease2 #cadillacjacksdiner #sunvalley #hollywoodtour #pandemic2020 #socialdistancing #wearamask #tonymiros","NumberOfLikes":62,"Hashtags":["#filminglocation","#grease2","#cadillacjacksdiner","#sunvalley","#hollywoodtour","#pandemic2020","#socialdistancing","#wearamask","#tonymiros"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":8,"Timestamp":1598635153,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 28 19:19:13 CEST 2020","Location":"Cadillac Jack's"},{"Owner":"mentalhigh.in","CaptionText":"SWIPE‚û°Ô∏è\nWeren\u2019t we suppose to already be this way ? \nWe were suppose to be and were asked by many to be prepared and ready to fight and exists along such Pandemicüößü¶†üß™üíâ\n\nBut again what has happened has happened and the world is now gaining it\u2019s senses again and trying to heal in terms of business‚ö∞Ô∏èü§Ø\n\nBeing Pandemic proof will come in handy in the future as the world will comeback to its original reigns and it will be a more better and a healthy financial environment if god forbid we are hit with such pandemic againü§¶üèª\u200D‚ôÇÔ∏è‚õëüéØ\n\nLet\u2019s Be Better And Let\u2019s Get Pandemic Proof for A Healthier Future to Comeüí™üèºüí´üí∏üí∞\n.\n.\nFollow : @mentalhigh.in \n  @mentalhigh.in \n  @mentalhigh.in \n  @mentalhigh.in \n.\n.\n#mentalhigh #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife #covid2019 #essentialworkers #futurebusinessowner #pandemicproof #proof #humankind #lockdownindia #economic #economiccollapse #businessconsultant #businessbranding #pandemicorona #diseaseprevention #diseasefree #investorswanted #startupadvice #worldawakening #awarenessiskey #financialhealth #coronavirusoutbreak‚ö†Ô∏è #worldhealthorganization #usaüá∫üá∏üíñ #indiaüáÆüá≥ #jio #amazonindia #betterfuture #positivityiskey","NumberOfLikes":189,"Hashtags":["#mentalhigh","#pandemic2020","#pandemiclife","#covid2019","#essentialworkers","#futurebusinessowner","#pandemicproof","#proof","#humankind","#lockdownindia","#economic","#economiccollapse","#businessconsultant","#businessbranding","#pandemicorona","#diseaseprevention","#diseasefree","#investorswanted","#startupadvice","#worldawakening","#awarenessiskey","#financialhealth","#coronavirusoutbreak‚ö†Ô∏è","#worldhealthorganization","#usaüá∫üá∏üíñ","#indiaüáÆüá≥","#jio","#amazonindia","#betterfuture","#positivityiskey"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1598635103,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 28 19:18:23 CEST 2020","Location":"New York, New York"},{"Owner":"tonyperezphotographs","CaptionText":"Mike Fox Skate Park. \nSanta Cruz California.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n#skateboard #skate #mikefoxskatepark #santacruzskateboards #pandemic2020 #shelterinplace #tonyperez #tonyperezphotographs #skaterboy #dearevanhansen","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#skateboard","#skate","#mikefoxskatepark","#santacruzskateboards","#pandemic2020","#shelterinplace","#tonyperez","#tonyperezphotographs","#skaterboy","#dearevanhansen"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by TONY PEREZ PHOTOGRAPHS on August 28, 2020.

But, by golly I\u2019m thankful for how it has forced me to slow down, reprioritize and work on things behind the scenes. When I look back at the last almost 6 months, I can\u2019t help but be proud of what I\u2019ve accomplished and how I had set my business up to be able to survive a rainy day (though no one expected it to be a flood!!), which allowed me to stay relatively level-headed through it all and stay the course.\n\nI felt really down for a while about how my business development savings were being used to survive, but then it hit me smack dab in the face the other day, that it actually was used for BD, just in a different way. And if I\u2019m being honest, it\u2019s been better than how I had intended to use it in Plan A.\n\nYou see, my business had grown at a slower pace than most because I am a perfectionist, methodical in my thinking and I follow my gut. That doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m not sometimes side-eying others and feeling like I\u2019m not doing enough or that I haven\u2019t had other challenges through this pandemic, but it ALWAYS comes together better than I had imagined in the first place when I wait (not always so patiently) or give in to the universe and what it deems I need.\n\nI\u2019ve been able to take the time to build a studio I\u2019m excited about (details to come on new things with the @theloestudio), revisit my pricing, offerings and process, so that it finally suits the level of service and quality of work I provide, and brings in the right couples and helps to generate income in the off-season. My life feels far more aligned than it has in a while and I\u2019m excited for the growth that is to come from it.\n\nHow have you been surviving this?

Quite often, the line of cars reached outside of the parking lot. People are hurting.\n\nJeanni and her family believe that \"if you can, you should\". Serving others is just what they do. Four years ago they started their own food drive called Baskets of Grace, which feeds families at Thanksgiving.

Some are helping at food pantries, others are making masks, while others have given up their time in other ways. Many have even donated their services to organizations so that they could stay afloat during these uncertain times.

The tradition of immersion refused to budge even this year (as every year there is a clarion call for not infusing plaster idols into the river stream) when pandemic has reigned high in the district. Several locals, despite warnings from civic body and cops, were adamant on immersing Ganesh idols in the river. Some decided to fling them off the bridge whereas others gathered on the riverbed for the traditional immersion on the occasion of Gauri Visarjan. While the cops have been trying their best to shoo away these enthusiasts by not allowing them to immerse the idol in the riverbed near Shaniwar Peth and Deccan areas, the citizens are equally stern on following the tradition. They want to let the idol flow with the water as they have been doing so for generations. The sneakiest of the lot preferred to toss the idols off the bridge joining Shaniwar Peth. Balashaeb Kopankar of Shivajinagar police station, said, \u201CWe have deployed cops at all the hooks and nooks and have tried our best to keep the situation in check.

Being alone doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019re lonely, nor does being around people mean you\u2019re not. Loneliness is a feeling only the person experiencing it can identify.\n\nIt can also be difficult to untangle whether loneliness is a symptom or a cause of a larger health issue: Do people withdraw socially because they\u2019re depressed, or do they become depressed because they\u2019re lonely?\n\nIn any case, studies show chronic loneliness has clear links to an array of health problems, including dementia, depression, anxiety, self-harm, heart conditions and substance abuse. People without social support also have lower chances of full recovery after a serious illness than people with a strong network, studies show.\n\nThe health consequences of loneliness are often likened to the effects of smoking 15 cigarettes a day\u2014and they\u2019re far more common.\n\nThere\u2019s a certain amount of stigma attached to any mental illness, but loneliness can be uniquely uncomfortable to talk about. It can feel like a personal failing to admit you don\u2019t have the social network you want, and there\u2019s a tendency for others to blame the victim.\n\nText excerpts & picture thankfully shared from an article in:\n(Time 22 - 29, June 2020\/Americans were already lonely.

I found myself kind of critiquing their pandemic response. For instance, the number of people who didn\u2019t wear masks or wore them wrong, how some people were not worried about what they touched or standing so close to other people, the general lack of hand sanitizer. It was interesting and amusing. They also have an extra with a PSA about COVID from the actors in the movie. It\u2019s hard to watch a movie like that and not think, \u201CThat\u2019s not how they would handle that,\u201D or \u201CThey would definitely have way more masks and stay away from other people.\u201D It was quite interesting.

We would love to brighten the lives of the children at @childrensla through KIF\u2019s program 1000 Ways to Give and plan to do so by raising funds and donations for all patients through the hospital\u2019s Child Life Program.\n\nWe understand that COVID protocols require patients at the hospital to stay in their rooms at all times except when undergoing tests and only allow one parent or relative at a time to be with them. Many children are in their rooms alone as parents are fearful of transmitting the virus to them while the children are sick, and single-parent families may have other children at home that need their care. Often patients have no way to connect with their parents or loved ones while in the hospital. We have learned that the hospital has had to close all of its playrooms where children typically go to socialize, play games and just be kids.  Our desire to create this project was born out of conversations with members of a small Bible study group from a small church in Los Angeles\u2014one of whom is a CHLA nurse and another being myself and a small group of friends wanting to complete a community outreach project in the midst of the global COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n Child Life requested game consoles such as Xbox One and PS4 along with games that the children can play in their rooms. The staff explained to us that technology can be healing to children in the hospital who just want something to feel normal and like home to them. KIF will collect monetary donations to purchase the requested items and will also accept in-kind donations of the actual technology! All donations are tax deductible! @childrensla  @kif_us #pandemic2020 #covid19 #helpingchildren #kindness #humanity #childrenarethefuture #prayfortheworld #prayforamerica #godblessamerica","NumberOfLikes":17,"Hashtags":["#pandemic2020","#covid19","#helpingchildren","#kindness","#humanity","#childrenarethefuture","#prayfortheworld","#prayforamerica","#godblessamerica"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Nia Lyte|Carolina M.

In 2017, nearly half of renters spent more than 30 percent of their income on housing costs, and approximately a quarter paid more than half of their earnings on housing. Compounding this, renters are more likely to be employed in industries vulnerable to employment shocks. The COVID-19 crisis increases both the severity of rent burden and the urgency for assistance.\r\n\nTo alleviate cost burden for all renters, federal policymakers could consider replacing or complementing existing unemployment assistance that provides income supports to households with job losses with rental assistance.  Rental assistance also alleviates housing instability and homelessness, which pose significant health risks under normal conditions and have been exacerbated by the pandemic.\r\n\n#love #race #understand #pandemic2020 #value #leader #paradox #invest #liberate #black #atlanta #raceinequality #weareone #country #covid19 #discipline #leadership #facts #ceooflimitless #learn #economics #limitlessacumen #limitlessacumenblog #truth #limitlessmindset #atlantabusinesschronicle #ajc #stopkillingus #america #limitlesscapitalmanagement","NumberOfLikes":14,"Hashtags":["#love","#race","#understand","#pandemic2020","#value","#leader","#paradox","#invest","#liberate","#black","#atlanta","#raceinequality","#weareone","#country","#covid19","#discipline","#leadership","#facts","#ceooflimitless","#learn","#economics","#limitlessacumen","#limitlessacumenblog","#truth","#limitlessmindset","#atlantabusinesschronicle","#ajc","#stopkillingus","#america","#limitlesscapitalmanagement"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1598561267,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 27 22:47:47 CEST 2020","Location":"Atlanta, Georgia"},{"Owner":"darranfoxx","CaptionText":"He warns everyone,Do Not Take The Covid Test,You will be forced to get Vaccinated And You Will Get Very Sick And Die\nThey Want 80 %Of The Population Wiped Outüôèüèªüôèüèªüôè\n.\n.\n.\n#saynotobillgates #staywoke #billgates #openyoureyes #healthyliving #wedonotconsent #crimesagainsthumanity #corruption #humanconnection #humanrights #pandemic2020 #plandemic #savehumanity #newworldorder #qanon #seekthetruth #thematrix #governmentcorruption #nonewnormal #tyranny #mindcontrol #deepstate #manipulation #freedom #immunesystem #wwg1wga #freespeech #trump2020 #thegreatawakening #savethechildren","NumberOfLikes":6,"Hashtags":["#saynotobillgates","#staywoke","#billgates","#openyoureyes","#healthyliving","#wedonotconsent","#crimesagainsthumanity","#corruption","#humanconnection","#humanrights","#pandemic2020","#plandemic","#savehumanity","#newworldorder","#qanon","#seekthetruth","#thematrix","#governmentcorruption","#nonewnormal","#tyranny","#mindcontrol","#deepstate","#manipulation","#freedom","#immunesystem","#wwg1wga","#freespeech","#trump2020","#thegreatawakening","#savethechildren"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598561258,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 27 22:47:38 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"aussieskeptic","CaptionText":"Thank you Louise Hampton for being brave enough to speak out.

It has a number of unique features that set it apart from most other coronavirus awards that various organizations plan to issue:\n‚†Ä\n‚úÖ The only universal medal: it is suitable not only for medical professionals, but also for representatives of any other services and departments. Precisely for reasons of universality, the designers of the Factory of Rewards, when developing the concept of the medal, abandoned the image of the Red Cross and other medical symbols. There are no analogues of such a medal either in Russia or abroad. If desired, a certificate with the signature and seal of the award commission is supplied with the medal \"for the fight against Covid\".\n‚†Ä\n‚úÖ The only international medal: The universal design of this Covid19 award is suitable for any country in the world;\n‚†Ä\n‚úÖ The only personalized medal: because the text is laser-engraved on the permanent stamped base of the pandemic award, it can be produced individually for each member of even large teams. Thus, each fighter with coronavirus will receive his own award separately.\n‚†Ä\n‚ùó You can order the medal for dedication in the fight against the pandemic only from the official manufacturer - the Factory of Awards company.\n‚†Ä\nWe can use laser engraving to apply any inscription and decor on the obverse and reverse of the medal‚ùó\n‚†Ä\nMedal cost: 6$ (\u203C Discounts from quantity\u203C)\n‚†Ä\n#covid #coronavirus #covid19 #covid19 #coronavirus #pandemic #covid_19 #medicine #covid #coronavirus2020 #pandemic2020 #thankstodoctors #corona #pandemiccovid #coronavirus pandemic #medal #award #order #cup #victory #coinsmedal #gift #numismatics #badges #stamping #medals #souvenir","NumberOfLikes":2,"Hashtags":["#covid","#coronavirus","#covid19","#covid19","#coronavirus","#pandemic","#covid_19","#medicine","#covid","#coronavirus2020","#pandemic2020","#thankstodoctors","#corona","#pandemiccovid","#coronavirus","#medal","#award","#order","#cup","#victory","#coinsmedal","#gift","#numismatics","#badges","#stamping","#medals","#souvenir"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by –§–∞–±—Ä–∏–∫–∞ –ù–∞–≥—Ä–∞–¥ on August 27, 2020.","NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598560499,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 27 22:34:59 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"dr.chasecastillo","CaptionText":"Definitely once in a lifetime experiences right now üò∑ stay safe, stay healthy!\nThank you @lmonsivais for the masks!\nRepresenting @matisyahu gear on \n________________________________________\n#pandemic #pandemic2020 #coronavirus #stayhealthy #staysafe #mask #matisyahu #oneday","NumberOfLikes":113,"Hashtags":["#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#coronavirus","#stayhealthy","#staysafe","#mask","#matisyahu","#oneday"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Chase Castillo, M.D. in Baltimore, Maryland.

Insufficient sleep can play a BIG role in your mood and how you show up in the world every day. For many, these types of feelings have been further exacerbated by COVID-19, as well as the stresses and uncertainties that stem from these unprecedented circumstances.\n\u2022\n\u2022\nSocial distancing, school closures, quarantines, layoffs, and more people working from home can all result in profound changes to normal daily routines for people of all ages and walks of life (@sleepfoundation). For example:\n- many people don\u2019t have the same anchors that they used to (e.g. dropping kids off at school, getting to the office on time and leaving at a specific time each day, going to the gym, or attending other social events).\n- More time at home means more time under artificial light and in front of digital screens. This may reduce light-based cues for maintaining your natural body clock \u2014 which can impact your alertness during the day and impede on your sleep at night.\n- if you\u2019re not working, or working less than you did before COVID-19, then you may be more likely to oversleep. This can cause grogginess, irritability and lack of focus. (It can become a vicious cycle.)\n\u2022\n\u2022\nKeys to reducing anxiety, depression, feelings of hopelessness and loneliness include:\n- Setting a schedule and sticking to that routine. This includes waking up, eating and going to sleep at the same times every day.\n- Make your bedroom your sleep haven \u2014 not the place where you work.\n- Get a healthy dose of natural light every day. Go for a walk or run, and open windows and blinds to get some additional sunlight. This will help give your sleep\/wake cycle a natural boost.\n- Be mindful of what you eat and drink because your diet can disrupt the quality and quantity of your sleep.\n- Be mindful of the media that you consume; an alternative to watching the news could be practicing relaxation techniques such as yoga, music, art, deep breathing, or aromatherapy.","NumberOfLikes":205,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by TrueDark¬Æ on August 27, 2020.
