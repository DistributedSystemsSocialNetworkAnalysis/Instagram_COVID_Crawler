Everything that I have ever worked for, I felt like was gone. \u2063\n\u2063\nWoke up and just didn\u2019t feel like myself. \u2063\nNeeded to find ground again. \u2063\n\u2063\nToday I took the first step. \u2063💫\nI had an amazing workout. Working out was something that helped me mentally and physically. I got wrapped up in life and I forgot what I loved doing. What made me happy.\u2063\n\u2063\nToday was the first day I felt like myself in a long time. \u2063\n\u2063\n\n#selflove #losingyourself #believeinyourself #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":39,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Amber Copson on August 29, 2020.

Whaaaat!\n\nThe other night, I took a bath - BY MYSELF - for the first time since before my son was born. I had a few minutes of calm and quiet in the bathroom, and I noticed that there were holes in the wall above my toilet. Those holes have been there for a year, so when I say 'noticed' you might be wondering what's up?! I mean, I'm in my bathroom multiple times a day, right? \n\nThe day we brought my son home from the hospital, one year + five days ago, the bathroom shelf fell off the wall and smashed our toilet in half, flooding the bathroom and causing all sorts of mayhem.\n\nWe cleaned up the mess, got a new toilet installed and moved the shelf into the basement, with every intention of getting some new hardware to re-install that thing SECURELY.\n\nAnd the shelf is still in the basement, and the holes are still in my wall. And it's been a year and I really only noticed it the other night (this story is going somewhere - I promise!).\n\nI've had a tough week, and one of the things I've been grappling with is the fact that it's been a year since I started taking meds for anxiety and depression, and I'm still struggling with my mental health. I mean, it's been a year, shouldn't I be 'better'?\n\nAnd then looking at those damn holes last night, I realized - I fixed the toilet because it was ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY but I put off fixing the wall because it just wasn't a priority. After awhile, the broken state of things just started to seem normal, so much that I stopped thinking about fixing it all together.\n\nAnd this is how I've approached my self-care in the past year. I've done what's absolutely necessary to stay alive and functioning(ish), but I haven't taken the time to fix the holes and rebuild what has fallen apart. I haven't even really NOTICED what needs fixing.\n\nI'm not sure if I'm the toilet or the wall or what in this story, but I know the time has come to start doing more than the bare minimum for myself. \n\nI'm going to make September a month to start over with self-care.\n\nWanna join me?","NumberOfLikes":16,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Self-care for moms on August 29, 2020.","NumberOfComments":11,"Timestamp":1598729214,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 29 21:26:54 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Today we experienced a new milestone of pulling ourself up to a stand!

The upcoming election is going to be problematic no matter what happens, and it is going to intensify the already deep division, tribalism and animus existent in the body politic. ➗\nDue to COVID-19 health concerns and voter suppression efforts, mail-in ballots will be rejected and polling locations will be closed, ensuring many people supporting either candidate will not be able to vote or have their votes counted. ➗\nJoe Biden will almost certainly win the popular vote by 3-7 million votes, but due to the electoral college, Donald Trump still has an even chance of winning reelection. We likely will not know the results on election night. ➗\nIf neither candidate wins in a landslide, the president will question all vote counts because he cannot accept the concept of defeat, be gracious in any way, or act for the benefit of the country (unless it benefits himself). ➗\nThe Republican Party no longer has a platform, instead declaring that it supports whatever the president wants. That's not hyperbole, either; look up the GOP's official 2020 platform. The party of Eisenhower or Reagan or even George W. Bush is gone. ➗\nThe president's most vocal supporters are animated almost entirely on grievance, anger, and malice. It's why a 17 year old boy thought it was okay to travel across state lines to murder people attending a protest against racism and police use of excessive force. ➗\nTake all of the above and mix in record levels of unemployment & underemployment caused by mismanagement of a deadly pandemic, and it gives me tremendous pessimism.

But he worried that the discovery hinted at a new kind of pollution, one set to become ubiquitous after millions around the world turned to single-use plastics to combat the coronavirus. \u201CIt\u2019s the promise of pollution to come if nothing is done,\u201D said Peltier.\n\nIn France alone, authorities have ordered two billion disposable masks, said Laurent Lombard of Opération Mer Propre. \u201CKnowing that \u2026 soon we\u2019ll run the risk of having more masks than jellyfish in the Mediterranean,\u201D he wrote on social media alongside video of a dive showing algae-entangled masks and soiled gloves in the sea near Antibes.\n\nThe group hopes the images will prompt people to embrace reusable masks and swap latex gloves for more frequent handwashing. \u201CWith all the alternatives, plastic isn\u2019t the solution to protect us from Covid.

Cheguei a ter inúmeras crises de pânico por dia... Primeiro porque iríamos ficar só 15dias em casa(🤣), depois tudo mudou e ninguém sabia quando isso ia acabar. Aí, os meninos ficaram sem escola, mexeu em toda a nossa rotina e ficamos três autistas totalmente desregulados aqui ao mesmo tempo! (Foi ótimo - sqn!) Depois, pela iminência de contágio e de morte, isso me tirava muito do sério! Também mexeu na minha necessidade de controle, que foi perdida...o meu toc gritou aqui e ainda continua bem intenso! Mas, em meio a todo esse cenário caótico, convenci o meu marido de comprarmos um bichinho! Eu e as crianças já estávamos totalmente isolados, com um nível alto de ansiedade, pensei que se tivéssemos um bichinho pra cuidar e amar poderia amenizar todos esses sentimentos e esse momento tão difícil. E assim, o Shaun chegou! 😍 Eu agora tenho um novo hiperfoco, em hamsters 🐹 e pesquisar tudo sobre ele me fez conseguir relaxar pra dormir várias vezes! Olha-lo girando na rodinha, diminui muito a minha ansiedade, pega-lo um pouquinho, trabalha o meu sensorial e o meu poder de confiança, colocar comida pra ele trabalha um pouquinho a minha seletividade alimentar, já que ele precisa de alimentos que eu não suportava nem pensar em tocar... enfim, vê-lo brincar me deixa sempre com um sorriso no rosto! 🤍 Tem sido maravilhoso ter essa bolinha de pêlos aqui!

Namun sejak April 2020 jumlah tersebut merosot hingga hanya dikisaran Rp200 juta saja.\n\nMerosotnya pendapatan dari sektor tersebut ujar Hendra tak lepas dengan adanya sejumlah kebijakan Pemerintah Kota Banjarmasin yang menutup beberapa objek wisata dan pembatasan jumlah pengunjung tempat keramaian serta rumah makan.\n\n\u201CMisalnya penutupan Siring Pierre Tendean, Patung Bekantan dan beberapa objek lain.

On the field, there were about 20-30 disc golfers who were enjoying themselves, playing on the only disc golf course at a baseball stadium in the country. \n\nDisc golf is a rising sport on the Gulf Coast with the Pensacola and Mobile areas having over 40 disc golf courses and hundreds of players.  One of those players is Wahoos co-owner and two-time Master\u2019s Winner Bubba Watson, from nearby Milton, FL. He is an avid disc golf player, who often plays on his downtime while on the road during PGA Tour stops.  Watson helped design the 9-hole course at Blue Wahoos Stadium, with input from his family and Wahoos Group Sales Executive Greg Liebbe, who has played disc golf for over 10 years. \n\nThe makeshift course is only open Friday thru Sunday for now, but it has already become a big hit in the community.  The course sees a couple hundred players on any given weekend, with the stadium\u2019s signature hole being at home plate, where players throw from the pitcher\u2019s mound to the basket.  The stadium also has several long outfield holes where you throw from deep center field to a basket at second base, and from near shortstop to a basket in deep left field.\n\n\u201CWhen they threw the idea out, I said: hey let\u2019s do it! I\u2019m a bit of disc golf nut, you could say\u201D mentioned Bubba Watson.\n\nPandemic Disc Golf Apparel. High quality materials and craftmsmanship with outstanding customer support.

But, by golly I\u2019m thankful for how it has forced me to slow down, reprioritize and work on things behind the scenes. When I look back at the last almost 6 months, I can\u2019t help but be proud of what I\u2019ve accomplished and how I had set my business up to be able to survive a rainy day (though no one expected it to be a flood!!), which allowed me to stay relatively level-headed through it all and stay the course.\n\nI felt really down for a while about how my business development savings were being used to survive, but then it hit me smack dab in the face the other day, that it actually was used for BD, just in a different way. And if I\u2019m being honest, it\u2019s been better than how I had intended to use it in Plan A.\n\nYou see, my business had grown at a slower pace than most because I am a perfectionist, methodical in my thinking and I follow my gut. That doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m not sometimes side-eying others and feeling like I\u2019m not doing enough or that I haven\u2019t had other challenges through this pandemic, but it ALWAYS comes together better than I had imagined in the first place when I wait (not always so patiently) or give in to the universe and what it deems I need.\n\nI\u2019ve been able to take the time to build a studio I\u2019m excited about (details to come on new things with the @theloestudio), revisit my pricing, offerings and process, so that it finally suits the level of service and quality of work I provide, and brings in the right couples and helps to generate income in the off-season. My life feels far more aligned than it has in a while and I\u2019m excited for the growth that is to come from it.\n\nHow have you been surviving this?

There are a lot of unknowns for us all, and this causes grief to arise.\n💜\nThe issue is that we don\u2019t always recognize it as grief. It comes out as anger, anxiety, worry, irritation, random spouts of crying, feeling helpless...get my point? It doesn\u2019t come up clearly as we would expect grief because we don\u2019t actually understand grief that well.\nSo if you notice yourself experiencing some of those above reactions, take a moment and ask yourself are you grieving. \n❓\nAre you grieving how life was?

Hugs are virtual, but connection is real. \n\nSince the world came to a stop in March 2020, Park Memorial has live-streamed 145 services for our families, and those services have been viewed a total of 26, 652 times.\n\nWe are learning new skills to offer bereaved families options for connection during Corona\u2026 because we understand that what grieving families need most is connection, compassion, and the ability to mourn together, no matter the miles nor the circumstances that divide.\n\n#parkmemorialcares #COVID19 #pandemic2020 #connectionsmatter #yeggrief #livestreaming","NumberOfLikes":3,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598546905,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 27 18:48:25 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"www.hgsolution.com.tr\nWeb sitemizi ziyaret etmeyi unutmayınız.\n\n#dezenfektan #pulvarize #disinfectant #dezenfektanstandı #atesolcerlidezenfekrankabini #hassas #püskürtme #sensor #covid19 #pandemic2020 #follow","NumberOfLikes":19,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598546904,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 27 18:48:24 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW IT FEELS TO BE IN HOSPITALITY DURING THIS CORONA - VIRUS PANDEMIC ?\n\nREMEMBER WHEN THE TITANIC WAS SINKING AND THE BAND CONTINUED TO PLAY ?...\n\nWELL WE'RE THE BAND😣\n\nJAGA JARAK SOSIAL ANDA SEKURANG - KURANGNYA 1 METER DARI ORANG LAIN BAGI MEMUTUSKAN RANTAIAN JANGKITAN COVID-19\n\n#GenesisNetworkAcademy #NewProject #GenesisProjectV1 #GNAMILLIONAIRE #GNATycoon #miiracellplus #positivevibes #beautifulday #dreamcar #tenangisgood #kitajagajaga #jagajagakita #pandemic2020 #jagakitajaga #kitajagakita #stayathome #staysafe #kitamasihbelummenang🇲🇾","NumberOfLikes":11,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598546187,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 27 18:36:27 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"💙 last succulent WIP 💙\n______________________________\nFollow me! @pandemic_creations for moreee :)\n______________________________\nHeyooo! 👋I'm sorry it looks like this 😬I'll definitely be drawing succulents again 🙃 Hope you had or have a great day!

This is the method that The Budget Mom teaches that makes the most sense and finally stuck with me. There\u2019s two ways you keep track of things. \n.\n🗓First is on a calendar page. The picture is my calendar page from September 2019. You write down the days each bill is due as well as any appointments that cost money like a haircut or an oil change. You color code based on what bills you want to pay with what paycheck of the month. In this example you can see that my job that I called \u201CArmstrong\u201D is highlighted in pink. So I planned to pay all the bills highlighted in pink with the \u201Cpink paycheck.\u201D I also had other paychecks that month (yellow, blue, purple) and you can see which bills were paid with these. This helps keep track of your bills ahead of time and can give you an idea if you\u2019ll end up being short and need to pick up a shift or work your side hustle more. This method was VERY helpful during the pandemic when my hours were super small one minute and the next minute we were overrun with patients.\n.\n🚗This also helps you not forget any expenses. That\u2019s why I say any appointments that cost money should go on here as well. 💇🏻\u200D♀️\n.\n📈I also have a monthly goal I keep track of on this page as well as my credit score. I wanted a place to keep an eye on it regularly so I track it here. \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n*tracker seen is from The Budget Mom.","NumberOfLikes":12,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Emerald, PA-S on August 27, 2020.","NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598541524,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 27 17:18:44 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"If you\u2019ve gotta have a work meeting...#workingfromhome #zoommeeting #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife","NumberOfLikes":20,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Rebecca Green Knight on August 27, 2020.","NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1598541524,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 27 17:18:44 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"A sunny photo (taken yesterday) for your rainy day, with a message: \nLocal food enthusiasts, we are so appreciative of your generous donations to cover some of our members' dues on GoFundMe.

I'd love some recommendations!\n\nIt is in a long long time that I come across a book that I'm not sure whether I like or not but it leaves an indelible mark on my heart. A book that is poignant yet disturbing, exciting yet powerful, intense yet dramatic and gripping in all its ways! That's the sort of book 'The Poison Of Love' was. You won't enjoy this book, you won't find an escape in it but you will be spellbound by what you read.\n\n#japreviews20 \n\n\"In principle, love and spirit are but one. Both ache to break free from fetters and take possession of suitable bodies.\"\n\n'The Poison Of Love' is essentially a story of toxic love, of love that grows on you, that claims you in its entirety, that takes away your 'self' from you. It is the story of Tulsi and Madhav. Tulsi, a woman who is attracted to this man in an irrevocable fashion. She foresakes everything, her family, her prospective career, her fiance, just to be with this man. This man who has had many dalliances in his past with women from all spheres of life asks Tulsi to marry him and she is naive enough to believe that he has fallen head over heals in love with her and would be faithful. But what unfolds is fierce, intense and bitter.\n\nK.R. Meera has written a deep, intense tale, a rather dark take on love. This is a book that speaks of and reflects on our primal instincts, desires and impulses. If you would ask me what was the best part about this book I would undoubtedly say it was K.R. Meera's writing. The translation is brilliantly done and I couldn't find a single flaw. Minishty retained the magic of Meera's writing in this book. There was an instance in the book that reminded me of the Greek tragedy- 'Medea' and that was the moment when I decided I would call this one a contemporary classic.\n\nMy takeaway from this book would be that an extreme sort of love and passion can lead to madness. Love can be like poison and this book sets out to warn you against that and it achieves that beautifully.
