It refers to how much we can handle before we dysregulate. \n\nAs parents, we strive to be in the optimal zone. This is the feeling of \"I've got this\" when we are met with difficult moments in our home. We are centered, calm and the ideal version of ourselves. \n\nWhen we are out of our window it is harder to stay in control and we can be thrown off balance more easily. \n\nThis concept provides us with a better understanding of ourselves and a starting point to discover what makes our tolerance higher and lower. It goes without saying that all of our rivers are probably a little narrower due to this pandemic and all that it has thrust upon us. \n\nHowever, when we turn self-blame to curiosity we can begin to give ourselves a little bit of grace, compassion and hopefully develop more strategies to stay within our window during times of stress.\n\nThe strategies provided are general, but I would love to hear how you all widen your rivers\/window of tolerance.

Have criteria and must-haves in an ideal home or city you\u2019d like to move to.\u2063\n\u2063\n2. Research potential cities (especially demographics)!\u2063\nThis one was SO important for us. When you grow up in a community of color (usually close to major metro areas), it\u2019s hard to leave & go to some of the country\u2019s cheapest cities because of the culture shock & discomfort that can come from leaving such a diverse area with people like you. Most \u201Ccheapest cities in America\u201D lists don\u2019t consider this factor that is on the mind of many poc when confronted with the idea of moving somewhere cheaper. With a global pandemic also happening, there may be a high possibility that you may not be able to visit your desired city beforehand (we didn\u2019t). So researching any & all details you can is VITAL.\u2063\n\u2063\n3. Examine your finances & have a few months\u2019 worth of rent & utilities saved up. If you have a remote job\/client work coming with you, even better!\u2063\n\u2063\n4. Set a moving timeline once you pick a city to move to based on your needs. We chose a sooner timeline to maximize not spending money from going out haha.\u2063\n\u2063\n5. Don\u2019t compromise on what\u2019s important!! While you may be anxious to just get the process over with, don\u2019t give into anything that is a dealbreaker for you, especially if you\u2019re unable to visit potential homes before you move.\u2063\n\u2063\n6. Once you move, get ready to thrive! Lots of poc live in expensive metro areas because that\u2019s where our communities are highly concentrated. However, the pandemic is making us realize that if we can do what we do from home, then why do we need to kill ourselves trying to survive in an expensive city?\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\nListen to my moving audio diary & more in-depth moving tips on the latest episode of @empoweredincolor, available on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, & Spotify now!

Foto: Luc√≠a Mart√≠. Sobre brotes e infancias \n\u201CMi nombre es Jorge Bentancur, tengo 65 a√±os. Pertenezco a una familia fundadora (1834) del primer barrio de Montevideo: la Villa del Cerro. Un barrio de trabajadores con las Carboner√≠as, los Saladeros y la Industria Frigor√≠fica que aportaron mucho al Uruguay de las vacas gordas. Amo mi barrio y tengo 50 a√±os de militancia social para contribuir a que todos tengamos oportunidades de llegar a un desarrollo integral como personas. Hace 15 a√±os fundamos la Organizaci√≥n de Usuarios de Salud del Zonal 17, de la cual fui uno de los pioneros. Realizamos un diagn√≥stico participativo donde participaron 300 vecinos y con esos insumos se elabor√≥ un Plan \u2018Salud derecho de todos\u2019 con 6 programas. El tema prioritario fue la constituci√≥n de la Red de Primera Infancia en 2006, somos la Cuna del pa√≠s con 4000 nacimientos por a√±o, de los cuales el 43% nacen en hogares pobres. All√≠ est√°n todos los centros educativos y de salud que trabajan la poblaci√≥n de 0 a 3 a√±os. En marzo cerraron 23 policl√≠nicas, las cual luego convencimos a las autoridades que era un disparate y reabrieron. Gracias al Primer Nivel de Atenci√≥n que la mayor√≠a de los casos de COVID 19 pudieron ser resueltos  sin internaci√≥n.  Por otro lado los peque√±os dejaron de concurrir a los Centros Educativos. Es sabido que el cerebro crece sobre todo en los primeros dos a√±os de vida. Partiendo del nacimiento, seg√∫n los est√≠mulos que haya recibido, la alimentaci√≥n correcta, etc... Puede tener 100% de neuronas o 50%. La no concurrencia a los Centros Educativos de Primera Infancia puede causar da√±os irreparables que hoy no tienen visibilidad. Teniendo en cuenta que el mayor capital de cualquier pa√≠s son los ni√±os y ni√±as que lo integran. Esperemos que los que toman las decisiones tengan conciencia de esto.\nüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëá üëá \n#pandemia #pandemic #pandemic2020 #covid_19 #covid_19uruguay #coronavirus #coronavirusuruguay #derechoshumanos #infancias #pobreza #salud #primerainfancia #cerro #primerniveldeatenci√≥n #fotodocumental #fotoregistro #fotorreportaje  #cronicas #cotidianidad","NumberOfLikes":33,"Hashtags":["#pandemia","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#covid_19","#covid_19uruguay","#coronavirus","#coronavirusuruguay","#derechoshumanos","#infancias","#pobreza","#salud","#primerainfancia","#cerro","#primerniveldeatenci√≥n","#fotodocumental","#fotoregistro","#fotorreportaje","#cronicas","#cotidianidad"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by AnA cUeStA on August 26, 2020 tagging @3maicul.

From this was born Team Rubicon - \"a veteran-led disaster response organization that unites the skills and experiences of military veterans with first responders to rapidly deploy emergency response teams.\"\n\nDuring the current pandemic, Team Rubicon has been serving in communities across the country providing assistance such as delivery service for food-insecure populations, coordination, and logistics support for those in temporary quarantine, as well as individual volunteers safely helping their neighbors.üëã\n\nIf you are interested to know more and find opportunities to support and engage with their humanitarian efforts please visit this: https:\/\/bit.ly\/3gxei6r\n\nWe salute the brave individuals who chose to be at the front lines not just during this pandemic but for any other similar crisis and offer their help.\nWe are Grateful! üôèüëã.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n#storiesfromthefrontlines #veterans  #veteranowned #helpingothers #weareinthistogether #wewillgetthroughthis #heroes  #build #covid19response #humanity #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":83,"Hashtags":["#neighborshelpingneighbors","#buildtoserve.","#storiesfromthefrontlines","#veterans","#veteranowned","#helpingothers","#weareinthistogether","#wewillgetthroughthis","#heroes","#build","#covid19response","#humanity","#pandemic2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Stories from the Frontlines on August 26, 2020 tagging @teamrubicon, and @storiesfromthefrontlines.

Sebenarnya saya masih sedang menjalani rawatan dan masih terdapat 1 pembedahan dalam KIV pada September ini.

So what did I do? I cleaned my kitchen. \n.\nAs a Type A person, I admit that one of the crappiest things about this pandemic is having little to no control about stuff that I used to plan and execute properly. There are probably a hundred things that I could have done better in my personal life, job, grad school, and side jobs if not for this virus. About 80% of my frustrations are deeply rooted in things that I cannot control anymore because of current circumstances. \n.\nHere's where keeping our kitchen tidy becomes a sanity-saver. I have control over how organized our pantry is and how long I want the cleaning process to take. I guess even for a little while, the act of taking back that control reminds me that not everything is lost in the world just yet. Of course, this is just me. I'm pretty sure others are going through times that are way tougher than mine - may it be financial, medical, physiological, or emotional. Still, it helps to identify your personal triggers and struggles, plus how to address them. It just happened that this is how I handled mine. \n.\nBottom line is, clean your space.

(1st pic #ctto üì∏ via @wadoughs #minimalist #weddingcakeideas #ugh) üòÖ\n\nSo I\u2019ve been having all these weird vivid dreams again with the elusive brooding \u201DTwin Soul,\u201D & I don\u2019t get it. \n\nRemember that last ethereal date in Singapore in my #dreamscape like, 5 weeks ago? Yeah, me, neither. I mean, barely. Even it did feel all so real. & then I got hungry & ate laksa anyway by my lonesome in @powerplantmall because who needs a date, especially in this #pandemic2020?! \n\nBut that would\u2019ve been a beautiful Moment if it were real. \n\nThis week, I\u2019ve had dreams where, 1st: a kid that he works for asked me what kind of shit I was listening to in high school. I immediately played the likes of @carcassband & @megadeth x @blacksabbath (@blackpinkofficial WHO?) x @ozzyosbourne\u2019s #SeeYouOnTheOtherSide song & @coccabal \u2014 while I was again in a dress, looking all Tita & girly ad nauseam. Then they asked for #OPM & I mentioned #SupernovaScum & #DarknessFell & crazy shit like @RunningAway in 1991 & #ColdSummerNights & this #DogsCanFly song, & when the blasted \u201DTwin Soul\u201D kuno heard that, he proposed right off the bat: \u201DWill you marry me?\u201D To which I replied astoundedly, \u201DUhm, what? NOW?!\u201D \n\nThen I got an engagement ring from @tiffanyandco & I was freaking out, because, waitttt, diba pandemic? \n\n2nd: I found myself in this retreat in Tagaytay with the rest of the #RaisingFrequencies fam, & the TS arranged for us to go together. He even tenderly held my hand the whole time we were there upon arrival. But he left around the evening, & I just saw myself sleeping alone in the cold (now why would I do that?!), & I had problems leaving on the last day of retreat, including getting lost in that green city, which is also strange, but it does get creepy at night there forrealz. He came to my rescue & hugged me & said he\u2019s never letting me go anymore, & even his parents (who IDK IRL) told him to look after me more (HUH WHAT). Wild, right? \n\n& these crazy vivid dreams have been ridiculously lifelike the whole time especially since last year. & I don\u2019t see any Developments IRL.

From the worldwide impact on football activities due to the Covid-19 Pandemic, to the record setting results we witnessed once the competitions restarted, this year's tournaments are surely memorable. \n\nOne major change to this year's tournaments was the decision to restart the games in single match knockout ties at neutral venues, starting with the quarter-finals.\n\nThe decision to restart the leagues without the typical home and away matches was due to the impact the corona virus pandemic had on the competitions. Due to the delays in restarting the tournaments, the concerns over the risk of infection, and travel restrictions across Europe, the organizers decided to play the remaining games in single match elimination format on neutral venues located in the country designated to host the finals.\n\nThis resulted in all remaining Europa League matches being played in single match knockout ties at neutral venues in Germany, while all remaining Champions League single match knockout ties were played at neutral venues in Portugal.\n\nTournament organizers are now considering whether to keep playing future games using the single match knockout ties at neutral venues format starting at the quarter-final stage.\n\nThough single match knockout ties may seem like an entertaining way to watch the tournament for many, and potentially fewer games will keep players more refreshed during the competition, the financial implications may in the end prove to be the deciding factor in their decision.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n#soccerposts90 #championsleague #europaleague #football #soccer #uefa #fifa #bayernmunich\n#psg #sevilla #intermilan #soccerposts #gol #goal #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":4,"Hashtags":["#soccerposts90","#championsleague","#europaleague","#football","#soccer","#uefa","#fifa","#bayernmunich","#psg","#sevilla","#intermilan","#soccerposts","#gol","#goal","#pandemic2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598421064,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 26 07:51:04 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"ROZAANA X BABY SHARK \nMaking birthday parties special with the new normal. \nCustomised baby shark masks for cute little baby Girl\u2019s 1st birthday. \n\nGet your own customised masks with us now.

Being an educator right now is very tiring and confusing. Some challenges seem insurmountable... but Dr. Kendi\u2019s words come back to me. We cannot lose hope. Tomorrow is a new day and a new chance for action towards change. The future can be bright. Amazing, brilliant, creative students give me hope. \n#educatorthoughts #teachersofinstagram #howtobeanantiracist #ibramxkendi #hope #pandemic2020 #studentsarethefuture","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":["#educatorthoughts","#teachersofinstagram","#howtobeanantiracist","#ibramxkendi","#hope","#pandemic2020","#studentsarethefuture"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by G.

It\u2019s even more challenging these days. Can you believe it? It\u2019s always been difficult, intense, exhausting. Now, like in infancy, it\u2019s once again nearly constant. And I am once again far less confident in my decision-making. The needs and worries are different but no less consuming. Maybe more so because it\u2019s all...well, novel...and there are few reliable authorities to consult. I do my best but I\u2019m nowhere near perfect and I know they need more. We\u2019re going to start school, despite my anxieties. It\u2019s another level of stress but I feel like I\u2019m holding them back if we don\u2019t try and who knows how long this goes on, who knows how much they\u2019ll miss. Our school district is smaller than most out here and our community has been hit less hard and NY is doing so well in general and I\u2019ve done a lot of reading and research that indicates there\u2019s a good chance it can go well if all the proper precautions are in place and I\u2019m worried but encouraged. For now. It feels impossible to make the \u201Cright\u201D decision because nothing is as it should be either way. But here we are. So we\u2019ll see.

Today\u2019s stop on my pandemic Hollywood tour is the house that the Lopez family supposedly lived in on the show!\n\n\u201CThe George Lopez Show\u201D house was originally built in 1885, making it the second-oldest home in San Fernando. The idyllic, Victorian, 4-bedroom, single family residence was commissioned by Senator Charles Maclay, a founder of San Fernando, and his wife, Catherine Paxton Maclay.\n\nThe Lopez family home from show is located at \u202A671 Fourth Street in San Fernando\u202C. Thankfully, the property looks much the same in person as it did onscreen, though it has since been painted green. Please note that this is a private residence so if you visit please do not trespass or disturb the people that live there.\n\n\u201CThe George Lopez Show\u201D originally aired for six seasons on ABC from 2002 to 2007. It is currently in syndication on Nick at Nite, and stars the titular comedian George Lopez, who plays a fictionalized version of himself and revolves around his life at work and raising his family at home.\n\nLopez drew much of the material for the show from his own life experiences, especially his upbringing in the San Fernando Valley. Lopez was one of the few Latinos to star in a television comedy series, following in the footsteps of Desi Arnaz, Freddie Prinze, and John Leguizamo.\n\nFun facts - The sitcom would have never existed without Oscar winning actress Sandra Bullock. In 2000, Bullock saw Lopez perform live at the Brea Improv Comedy Club. Bullock had been interested in developing a TV show with a Latino storyline, being concerned about the lack of visibility for Latinos on American television. Bullock approached Lopez backstage after the show and made her pitch to produce and star in a situational comedy centered around the comedian. \n\nFor the first five seasons, the show had an all-Latino cast with the exception of Albanian American actress Masiela Lusha, who played George\u2019s daughter Carmen.\n\nThe character \u201CGeorge Lopez\" was ranked #18 in \"TV Guide\"'s list of the \"50 Greatest TV Dads of All Time\"#filminglocation #thegeorgelopezshow #sanfernando #hollywoodtour #pandemic2020 #socialdistancing #wearamask #tonymiros","NumberOfLikes":32,"Hashtags":["#18","#filminglocation","#thegeorgelopezshow","#sanfernando","#hollywoodtour","#pandemic2020","#socialdistancing","#wearamask","#tonymiros"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1598374016,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 18:46:56 CEST 2020","Location":"San Fernando Valley"},{"CaptionText":"Narrow streets has ways of bringing you closer to beautiful realities üá≤üá¶ \n\u2060\nCool #solotravel üì∏ by @boifromvenus\n\u2060\nFollow & Tag @travsolo on your awesome travel pics for a chance to be featured! ‚úàÔ∏è\u2060\n.\u2060\n.\u2060\n.\u2060\n.\u2060\n.\u2060\n.\u2060\n.\u2060\n#solofemaletraveller #socialdistancingworks #extrovertedintrovert\u2063 #solotraveler #solotravelingisfun #solotraveling #girlstravel #globaltravel #covidtravel #pandemic2020 #pandemictravel #covidtravel2020 #morrocco","NumberOfLikes":37,"Hashtags":["#solotravel","#solofemaletraveller","#socialdistancingworks","#extrovertedintrovert\u2063","#solotraveler","#solotravelingisfun","#solotraveling","#girlstravel","#globaltravel","#covidtravel","#pandemic2020","#pandemictravel","#covidtravel2020","#morrocco"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Solo Travel Easier on August 25, 2020.

People really tell me that science is a matter of opinion, and everyone is entitled to do as they wish even though over 180,000 Americans are dead. They also feel like racism is their right, too, and maybe you can have whatever thoughts in your head, but we are making it socially unacceptable to be racist, now. Like, for real unacceptable and not just the \"make sure your racism is veiled enough to keep people happy,\" unacceptable. No more hiding behind heritage & pretending like that's okay. There should be more penalties in place for people who are obviously discriminating against others for the color of their skin. We have to make it much harder to be racist by calling people out on their behavior and words. Every time we see or hear it. It's THAT important. We WILL crumble as a country if we don't do this. America was never established to be a country of hate, even when they did enslave black people, and ran indigenious people from the land. They were running from hate of their religion, and to freedom for anyone to choose how to worship. That's why it became a \"melting pot.\" People of all kinds came to America to flee their governments, and there have been white people trying to fight for #equality since this country began. It was always intended for all people to be seen as equal and that they have the right to life, liberty, & to pursue happiness, even though there have been people fighting against certain people having those things since time began.

God plants these beautiful desires in our hearts, (unique to each individual) we water them together in hope, prayer & intimacy with Him. Then they grow into bloom in season~ the beauty meant to be shared. It always points back to Him, because it all started with him. We can\u2019t take credit. \n\nThis is the home we\u2019ve been waiting, believing & praying for for nearly 20 years. We felt that without the right timing it wouldn\u2019t have the impact it was meant to, so we waited until we felt a release. \nSpeaking of IMPACT~ December 2019 we stepped out in faith, believing that so much good was coming. It DID. In spite of all that came with Covid~ which included a major loss of income immediately after our down payment. God gave us a gift during a challenging season we never could have anticipated. The joy that came through this process of building was the SWEETEST gift, and it only secures the confidence in my heart that God is kind. Our girls experienced that joy with us & I can\u2019t help but think of all they would have missed out on if the timing was different... even months earlier or later. \nThe reason this carries so much joy for us is because we used to be filled with disappointment for years, and we blamed it unknowingly on God. The past 5 or so years especially we\u2019ve been unlearning some of our negative ideology of God~ that process has been painful, amazing & freeing. Its so easy to associate our past, our pain, our hard experiences with God- yet we needed to learn that God cares so deeply about our past, our pain, and our hard experiences. Before we received this gift, we needed to understand that our blame was misplaced- God has always been a loving Father- it\u2019s our misinterpretation of Him & our lens that has shifted. \nYou\u2019ll have to sit with me here at our house & let me share all the details of God\u2019s goodness with you, b\/c I haven\u2019t even scratched the surface. \nYou are so welcome here ü§ç\n#miraclehome #miracleshappen #beautiful\n#pandemic2020 #homesweethome","NumberOfLikes":91,"Hashtags":["#miraclehome","#miracleshappen","#beautiful","#pandemic2020","#homesweethome"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":30,"Timestamp":1598363885,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 15:58:05 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"üíÅüèª\u200D‚ôÄÔ∏èüëåüòä‚ù§Ô∏è#pandemic2020  #covid_19","NumberOfLikes":7,"Hashtags":["#pandemic2020","#covid_19"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Cinthia Vale on August 25, 2020.

They'll send cars to come pick them up. They'll reserve bar stools. They'll buy them drinks. It's good business, but it's also just plain tradition. They don't pay for drinks, and they don't sing karaoke - but they'll loudly cheer everyone who does and they'll stay until late in the night.\n\nThe virus, of course, put the kibosh on all that.

It\u2019s the last few weeks. It\u2019s a bitter sweet time of year for me, especially this one. It\u2019s been 90 plus pretty much all summer, during a pandemic. A FLIPPING PANDEMIC. Beyond hot and humid, trying to balance social distancing with an active 3 year old. Explaining we can see our family only, wearing masks everywhere, trying to make sure a little person who doesn\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening mental health is being tended to. Isolating him, keeping him and others safe, and all the while being judged for doing it. That\u2019s the culture we live in these days. Everyone thinks the know best not only for themselves but everyone else. Keyboard warriors. The cool thing is a long time ago I learned that what others think and say and feel about me isn\u2019t for me at all, it\u2019s for them. And that\u2019s a freedom I try tonnevee give away. There\u2019s so much much to what others are going through. Things aren\u2019t ever black and white. My job isn\u2019t to judge others but to stay in my lane and help my neighbor anyway i can. \nMy most favorite time of year coming to its end, but my runner up of fall is just on the horizon. I\u2019m starting to see pops of yellow, red, oranges in the trees. As the seasons change I\u2019m navigating covid 19 and life in general. Now I\u2019m gearing up for a new role of teacher. Juggling mom role, partner, business woman. Whoa. All while planning a wedding. Seasons are changing, and so am I. Squeezing in the last bits of summer, being where my feet are, and reminding myself to breathe and forever be grateful. #grateful #endlesssummer #summertime #falliscoming #momblogger #momsofinstagram #covidbride #2020bride #slayathomemom #momtruth #sobermom #sobermomtribe #stayingyourlane #wheremyfeetare #thankful #beagoodperson #keyboardwarrior #fallfoliage #slayathomemom #momtruth #parentinginapandemic #pandemic #pandemic2020 #homeschooling #homeschoollife #homeschoolmom #planningtime #weddingplanner #notmychairnotmyproblem","NumberOfLikes":10,"Hashtags":["#grateful","#endlesssummer","#summertime","#falliscoming","#momblogger","#momsofinstagram","#covidbride","#2020bride","#slayathomemom","#momtruth","#sobermom","#sobermomtribe","#stayingyourlane","#wheremyfeetare","#thankful","#beagoodperson","#keyboardwarrior","#fallfoliage","#slayathomemom","#momtruth","#parentinginapandemic","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#homeschooling","#homeschoollife","#homeschoolmom","#planningtime","#weddingplanner","#notmychairnotmyproblem"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Giulia Cappadona on August 25, 2020.

They assumed, like many others, that writing is easy for me, as I used to work for many years as a journalist. It's not at all true. I always thought that you need a good story in order to be able to write something that would be of real interest to anyone. My text is a plain diary of the weeks I've spent in lockdown. My partner found the idea challenging and he wrote a nice short story that is inserted in and adds value to my text ;). He is next to me as I write this introduction and says \"I hope our story is one of the best, there is some romance involved, we should call it Romance in Times of Crises\" - our romance was in crisis indeed, but all's well that ends well. I take pride in saying that our story, by being one of the first, encouraged the others to write; they very likely thought \"I can definitely do better\" and most of them did great! What I like best about these stories is their authenticity, the authors are all genuine and so real, I am honoured to be in such a good company.. \nThe book is about to be published, I am very proud of my friends who made it happen.\"\n#worldspandemicchronicles\n#2020vision\n#lockdown2020\n#uk\n#lockdownlife\n#lockdonuk\n#quarantinelife\n#pandemic2020 #covid_19  #covid19 #scarborough #uk","NumberOfLikes":11,"Hashtags":["#worldspandemicchronicles","#2020vision","#lockdown2020","#uk","#lockdownlife","#lockdonuk","#quarantinelife","#pandemic2020","#covid_19","#covid19","#scarborough","#uk"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @worldspandemicchronicles on August 25, 2020.

Seagull on Thursday accepted the condition recommendation, which is subject to approval by the legislature's Regulations Review Committee.\n\nAccording to the National Pancreas Foundation, the disease causes inflammation of the pancreas that does not heal or improve.
