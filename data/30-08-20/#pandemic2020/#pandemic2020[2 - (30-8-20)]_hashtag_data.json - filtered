Debo confesar que me costo trabajo hacer la rutina de hoy, no traía mucha energía a pesar que me desperté sin problema. Después de mi rutina subí a tomarme mi café para después bañarme. Cuando subí Zoe seguía dormida y despertó cuando iba a peinarme, así que fui a darle su leche en lo que terminaba yo de peinarme. Después regrese para cambiarla y bajar hacer el desayuno. En lo que sacaba las cosas para hacerlos pancakes Zoe se puso a pintar. Hoy quiso hacerlos de nuevo de colores, después de desayunar tuve que salir rápido a dejar una caja a la paquetería para después ir a jugar con bebé Cristy. Estuvieron muy contentas jugando juntas hasta que llegó la hora de la siesta, cuando llegamos Zoe quiso comer algo antes de subir, cuando se quedó dormida baje hacer lo que hacía falta para la comida. Ya estaba la comida cuando despertó, así que bajamos a comer para luego salir a esperar a Kuko para correr y luego ir a caminar, al regresar comimos algo antes de subir para prepararnos para dormir.\n\n#zoedemicorazon🐥 #recolectandomomentos #staysafeathome #fighting👑🦠 #motherhoodincovid19 #SocialDistancing #FlattentheCurve #stayhomechallenge #stayhomesafelifes #pandemic2020 #quaranteam","NumberOfLikes":8,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598497887,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 27 05:11:27 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Use máscara.\n__________\n#pinkfloyd #fiqueemcasa #stayhome #covid19 #pandemia #pandemia2020 #pandemic #pandemic2020 #coronavirus #show #socialdistancing #distanciamentosocial #rock #vinyl #uk #cover #thewalllive #mascara #isthereanybodyoutthere #mask #wearsmask","NumberOfLikes":176,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Bloco do Pink Floyd in Bloco do Pink Floyd.

Have criteria and must-haves in an ideal home or city you\u2019d like to move to.\u2063\n\u2063\n2. Research potential cities (especially demographics)!\u2063\nThis one was SO important for us. When you grow up in a community of color (usually close to major metro areas), it\u2019s hard to leave & go to some of the country\u2019s cheapest cities because of the culture shock & discomfort that can come from leaving such a diverse area with people like you. Most \u201Ccheapest cities in America\u201D lists don\u2019t consider this factor that is on the mind of many poc when confronted with the idea of moving somewhere cheaper. With a global pandemic also happening, there may be a high possibility that you may not be able to visit your desired city beforehand (we didn\u2019t). So researching any & all details you can is VITAL.\u2063\n\u2063\n3. Examine your finances & have a few months\u2019 worth of rent & utilities saved up. If you have a remote job\/client work coming with you, even better!\u2063\n\u2063\n4. Set a moving timeline once you pick a city to move to based on your needs. We chose a sooner timeline to maximize not spending money from going out haha.\u2063\n\u2063\n5. Don\u2019t compromise on what\u2019s important!! While you may be anxious to just get the process over with, don\u2019t give into anything that is a dealbreaker for you, especially if you\u2019re unable to visit potential homes before you move.\u2063\n\u2063\n6. Once you move, get ready to thrive! Lots of poc live in expensive metro areas because that\u2019s where our communities are highly concentrated. However, the pandemic is making us realize that if we can do what we do from home, then why do we need to kill ourselves trying to survive in an expensive city?\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\nListen to my moving audio diary & more in-depth moving tips on the latest episode of @empoweredincolor, available on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, & Spotify now!

Homeschooling is something that OTHER families do. It seems like a nice idea, but it\u2019s definitely not my jam. Yet, here we are\u2026\n.\n.\nI feel like this homeschooling thing is my whole life right now. I could have sent my kids back to school with their friends, at their private school, which we do in fact love and miss. Alternatively, I could\u2019ve enrolled them in our local school district, and even chosen an online option. Neither of these choices felt quite right, not right now. \n.\n.\nThe way we\u2019re doing this is so hands-on, and intimate, and strangely satisfying. Granted, the feelings of satisfaction aren\u2019t QUITE as intense when I\u2019m breaking up a squabble or LITERALLY BEGGING someone to pay attention, but mostly, it\u2019s just\u2026 good.\n.\n.\nWe are laughing, and learning, and making memories. I\u2019m spending a great deal of time reading to my kids every day. I\u2019ve been so inspired by @readaloudrevival, and I\u2019m completely psyched about the fact that I have time and freedom to give my kids the gift of some incredible read-aloud experiences this school year.\n.\n.\nBig props also to @MasterBooks. We\u2019re really loving their Christ-centered curricula. It\u2019s a perfect fit for our family and the kids\u2019 learning styles.\n.\n.\nIt\u2019s a messy, weird time. I don\u2019t really know what the right answers are when it comes to moving beyond this pandemic-mindset. What I do know for sure, is that I can\u2019t really fathom regretting the moments that we\u2019re going to share together, as a family, this school year. \n.\n.\n.\n#homeschool #homeschooling #pandemichomeschool #pandemic2020 #backtoschool #bts2020 #homeschoollife #masterbooks #readaloudrevival #readaloud #homeschoolmom #homeschoolfamily #homeschoolmama","NumberOfLikes":51,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Crissy Page in Chillicothe, Ohio with @masterbooks, and @readaloudrevival.

But knowing my kiddos don\u2019t get their typical start sucks. I get it. I just don\u2019t like it for them. There is something exciting with starting a new school year, finding your new desk, meeting your teacher and seeing friends everyday.

Maybe you don't know what that looks like or where to begin.  That was once me.\n\nRewind 8 years ago and I was a little lost.  I was stressed.  I was changing jobs & jobless, my personal life was suffering, I wasn't the most confident in my own skin, and I wasn't at my healthiest.  I knew I could do better, and knew I was capable of more!\n\nAfter taking the time to focus on ME.  My health, my relationships, doing the things that made ME happy--now I am a wife, & Mama to two young boys 👶🏼👶🏼. I am a mompreneur and mentor to other women who have decided IT WAS TIME TO SAY YES & MAKE THAT CHANGE.\n\nYou see--our transformations, our stories change with time.  This year we have all dealt with our fair share of stress and anxiety.  Being home with littles, not being able to get out and do things, will there be school?  Will there not be school?  Will the kids behave ok without having those social connections?  Will our kids be ok and healthy? 🤷🏼\u200D♀️\n\nBut this is today.  This before and after picture represents almost 2 years of getting my butt in gear, getting into a routine again after all those sleepless nights with two young boys.  And figuring out that I COULD wake up at 5-5:30am, press play on a 25-30 min workout daily before my day job, focus on my mindset, establish a morning routine that served me, and feed my body with nutrient dense foods, but still be able to indulge and get RESULTS!  It\u2019s THIS 👆🏼- something that I could control and it serves me.\n\nGuys- focus on what you can control and stay the course!  Sure, we can\u2019t control what\u2019s going on in the world 🌎 right now- but we can focus on bettering ourselves.

So what did I do? I cleaned my kitchen. \n.\nAs a Type A person, I admit that one of the crappiest things about this pandemic is having little to no control about stuff that I used to plan and execute properly. There are probably a hundred things that I could have done better in my personal life, job, grad school, and side jobs if not for this virus. About 80% of my frustrations are deeply rooted in things that I cannot control anymore because of current circumstances. \n.\nHere's where keeping our kitchen tidy becomes a sanity-saver. I have control over how organized our pantry is and how long I want the cleaning process to take. I guess even for a little while, the act of taking back that control reminds me that not everything is lost in the world just yet. Of course, this is just me. I'm pretty sure others are going through times that are way tougher than mine - may it be financial, medical, physiological, or emotional. Still, it helps to identify your personal triggers and struggles, plus how to address them. It just happened that this is how I handled mine. \n.\nBottom line is, clean your space.

The cloth mask has been temporarily replaced with a lavender mud mask of course.\n\nI tested positive for COVID-19 and I have experienced a roller coaster of emotions over the last few days. It\u2019s been overwhelming and frustrating to say the least.\n\nFirst, I guess I wanted to extend a thank you to everyone who has known, and reached out to check in or offer solace or sympathy. I have kept this very private due to the stigma, magnitude, and seriousness of this diagnosis. I still plan to maintain a level of privacy as I go through the motions.\n\nWhat may or may not come as a surprise is that fact that I am mainly asymptotic. I was not aware I had COVID and was tested as a precaution. The symptoms I have experienced during the latter half of the virus include:\nRandom and Intense tiredness\nMalaise (no active cough, fever, chills, or aches)\nI\u2019ve experienced maybe one or two headaches (I\u2019ve attributed to stress )\n\nWhat\u2019s been the most rattling is knowing I caught the virus while taking precautions and following protocol. (This is not an invitation for anyone to debate whether the protocols put in place work or are real) it\u2019s just frustrating that there are people out there being negligent with their actions and could be putting others in danger. But, enough of the victim mentality... I am happy and well. \n\nAs I conclude this public service announcement I want to stress how important it is for everyone to follow prevention measures and to think about others with respect to any and all illness. It\u2019s not about me... or you... it\u2019s about trying to prevent harm to others.\nI could have easily not gone to get tested and parade around as if everything was fine putting EVERYONE in my circle in harm.\n\n\u2014-> Whether or not you believe in karma, I am thinking there\u2019s a reason for everything - with a consequence whether positive or negative. With every action is a reaction. I am not sure what this year is trying to provide for me but I am excited to see the abundance I receive.\n\nBe safe everyone.","NumberOfLikes":106,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Britt Hildy in Los Angeles, California with @datshawtyshort.

Yet, we don't hear much of their stories.\n\nSo, here's one.\n\nMeet Sumon Bhai.\nNearly 20 years ago, he had to leave his studies due to financial difficulties. He came to Dhaka and started working at someone else's Nilkhet bookstore. Few years later, he opened his own. He gained a reputation for selling high quality English books which were in huge demand. Some of his books have even been sold online and marketed as premium quality. He even has a page of his own.\n\nHowever, like many this gentleman was badly affected by the coronavirus pandemic. For example, today he was able to make a sale of only 150tk.\nYet, he is not disturbed. \n\"I may not have been able to complete my studies due to my economic troubles. But, helping people to further their educational goals with my books - that's what makes me happy,\" he says. \n\nIndeed, Pashe Achi Initiative sees him as a beacon of hope and inspiration that makes our work with it.

We went to the mall the other day just to start her school shopping here. \n\nThis was supposed to be her big year! First year no uniforms, new school and getting older everyday. It was not supposed to be closed. It was not supposed to be empty. She was not supposed to be instantly crushed and brought to tears by the darkness and the few empty racks left there. \n\nTo some this is just a store but to her it was her growing independence of having \u201Cher\u201D store filled to the ceiling with her styles. Her place! She could always find 1 or 5 things every time we went to the mall. Yes, we can buy online but to a 9 year old it is not the same. \n\nThis pandemic has been hard on us all but dang it my heart breaks for these kid\u2019s. They are the ones that are expected to just roll with it when us as parents are struggling to adapt as well. They are having their schools go online or a few hours at a time, they haven\u2019t gotten to see friends, grandparents or teachers, they have to wear masks everywhere they go and I can feel the anxiety enter their sweet bodies at just going to the store. \n\nThis is hard. We pray every single night that things get better so we can fully appreciate living our lives to the fullest everyday. We pray for healing. We pray for understanding and most if all we pray for GRACE.❤️ #justice #pandemic2020 #breaksmyheart #justiceclothing #justiceclothesforgirls #justiceclothes #mygirl #mommyhood #momsofinstagram","NumberOfLikes":16,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Heather Simmons on August 25, 2020.

Today\u2019s stop on my pandemic Hollywood tour is the house that the Lopez family supposedly lived in on the show!\n\n\u201CThe George Lopez Show\u201D house was originally built in 1885, making it the second-oldest home in San Fernando. The idyllic, Victorian, 4-bedroom, single family residence was commissioned by Senator Charles Maclay, a founder of San Fernando, and his wife, Catherine Paxton Maclay.\n\nThe Lopez family home from show is located at \u202A671 Fourth Street in San Fernando\u202C. Thankfully, the property looks much the same in person as it did onscreen, though it has since been painted green. Please note that this is a private residence so if you visit please do not trespass or disturb the people that live there.\n\n\u201CThe George Lopez Show\u201D originally aired for six seasons on ABC from 2002 to 2007. It is currently in syndication on Nick at Nite, and stars the titular comedian George Lopez, who plays a fictionalized version of himself and revolves around his life at work and raising his family at home.\n\nLopez drew much of the material for the show from his own life experiences, especially his upbringing in the San Fernando Valley. Lopez was one of the few Latinos to star in a television comedy series, following in the footsteps of Desi Arnaz, Freddie Prinze, and John Leguizamo.\n\nFun facts - The sitcom would have never existed without Oscar winning actress Sandra Bullock. In 2000, Bullock saw Lopez perform live at the Brea Improv Comedy Club. Bullock had been interested in developing a TV show with a Latino storyline, being concerned about the lack of visibility for Latinos on American television. Bullock approached Lopez backstage after the show and made her pitch to produce and star in a situational comedy centered around the comedian. \n\nFor the first five seasons, the show had an all-Latino cast with the exception of Albanian American actress Masiela Lusha, who played George\u2019s daughter Carmen.\n\nThe character \u201CGeorge Lopez\" was ranked #18 in \"TV Guide\"'s list of the \"50 Greatest TV Dads of All Time\"#filminglocation #thegeorgelopezshow #sanfernando #hollywoodtour #pandemic2020 #socialdistancing #wearamask #tonymiros","NumberOfLikes":32,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1598374016,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 18:46:56 CEST 2020","Location":"San Fernando Valley"},{"CaptionText":"Narrow streets has ways of bringing you closer to beautiful realities 🇲🇦 \n\u2060\nCool #solotravel 📸 by @boifromvenus\n\u2060\nFollow & Tag @travsolo on your awesome travel pics for a chance to be featured! ✈️\u2060\n.\u2060\n.\u2060\n.\u2060\n.\u2060\n.\u2060\n.\u2060\n.\u2060\n#solofemaletraveller #socialdistancingworks #extrovertedintrovert\u2063 #solotraveler #solotravelingisfun #solotraveling #girlstravel #globaltravel #covidtravel #pandemic2020 #pandemictravel #covidtravel2020 #morrocco","NumberOfLikes":37,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Solo Travel Easier on August 25, 2020.

Rain or shine, I've always enjoyed it. \n\nI used to enjoy sitting on the tube\/bus too though. Using the time to write emails or plans, or just listening to my favourite music. And watching people. \nAnd I used to love to just randomly and casually stop by a cafè and treat myself with a quick, unplanned break. \n\nI miss doing all this, either alone or with my son and my husband. \n\nAnd although we are making our apartment a nice place and more ideal to spend a lot of time inside compared to the previous house, with a very well looked after communal garden that makes our life with a toddler easier, I miss feeling safe and able to go wherever I want and do whatever I want. \n\nI miss that life so much, much more than I can say. \n\nAnd yes, I'm beyond grateful that the area around our new apartment is very walking-with-a-little-one friendly, and that we can go out for a quick stroll around the block anytime we want since the pavements are spacious and there is a big pedestrian area at our doorstep too where Danny can be free. \n\nBut it is still not the same. \n\nI don't want to complain, but I want to get this constant thought out of the system, because it keeps on coming back several times a day and it's hard to deal with it sometimes. \n\nI'm proud of how I'm trying to cope with the situation ever since last march (we need to tell ourselves we are proud of what we do more often peeps!) but I'm also tired. \n\nIt's time to go back to some regular meditation and Epsom salt baths, just to find the right mindset and to get ready to face what's coming. \n\nLast days of August are always full of reflections and thoughts. And this year, more than ever, these days are also full of hope...\n\n#LaValigiaDiGLo #blog #LaCasadellAlbero #lockdown #pandemic2020 #August2020 #familylife","NumberOfLikes":14,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by GLo Fuson in London, United Kingdom.

READ BELOW\n\nI want to give a few examples from the Trump presidency how this was all SCRIPTED in advance. Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton had a bunch of fake tough talk between each other during the campaigns in 2016, with Trump even claiming he'd put Hillary in jail once he got elected. But after Trump won, he had a luncheon in January 2017, where he honored and applauded, not only Hillary, but also Bill Clinton. PROVING IT'S ALL STAGED AND ALL PHONY! \n\nWe also have Trump's text hotline number which is 88022. I've shown before how Trump is \"88\" in Simple Gematria. I think 8s and 2s were also symbolic of this Pandemic (the new 9\/11) during Trump's Presidency. \n\nTrump made a statement on October 5, 2017 that it was the \"CALM BEFORE THE STORM\". If you add ***888 DAYS*** to October 5, 2017, you get March 11, 2020 which is the date WHO declared this a GLOBAL PANDEMIC. \n\nAnd from 9\/11\/2001 terror attacks up to 3\/11\/2020 there are **222 MONTHS** in between. I think Trump's text hotline was giving us a clue with 88022 (the 8s and the 2s and how they were symbolic). \n\nThen you have the 1990 \"Heavy Metal Magazine Comic Strip\" where Trump and a populist named Helmsley build a WALL in New York City. They eventually have a rift with each other, and Helmsley dismantles Trump. But Trump is poised to make a strong comeback and he hands Mike Tyson a 'hat', and says that they were both hit below the belt by Helmsley but they will be #1 AGAIN (implying a COMEBACK for both of them). \n\nIn November 2020, Mike Tyson has a COMEBACK FIGHT with Roy Jones Jr. It seems there are a ton of clues here that everything during Donald Trump's presidency (even menial things like Mike Tyson fighting again) have been SCRIPTED long in advance.","NumberOfLikes":3,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598371498,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 18:04:58 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"🤗😁 just be\nGrateful for everything\nTry to be better day by day\nI am not perfect but I can be great\n😎😘\n#hiworld \n#womaninbusiness \n#womanpreneur \n#holiday \n#pandemic2020 \n#pandemiclife \n#iampru \n#stillgrowing \n#businessfromhome \n#justthewayiam","NumberOfLikes":87,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Marissa-Finance Future Planner on August 25, 2020.

God plants these beautiful desires in our hearts, (unique to each individual) we water them together in hope, prayer & intimacy with Him. Then they grow into bloom in season~ the beauty meant to be shared. It always points back to Him, because it all started with him. We can\u2019t take credit. \n\nThis is the home we\u2019ve been waiting, believing & praying for for nearly 20 years. We felt that without the right timing it wouldn\u2019t have the impact it was meant to, so we waited until we felt a release. \nSpeaking of IMPACT~ December 2019 we stepped out in faith, believing that so much good was coming. It DID. In spite of all that came with Covid~ which included a major loss of income immediately after our down payment. God gave us a gift during a challenging season we never could have anticipated. The joy that came through this process of building was the SWEETEST gift, and it only secures the confidence in my heart that God is kind. Our girls experienced that joy with us & I can\u2019t help but think of all they would have missed out on if the timing was different... even months earlier or later. \nThe reason this carries so much joy for us is because we used to be filled with disappointment for years, and we blamed it unknowingly on God. The past 5 or so years especially we\u2019ve been unlearning some of our negative ideology of God~ that process has been painful, amazing & freeing. Its so easy to associate our past, our pain, our hard experiences with God- yet we needed to learn that God cares so deeply about our past, our pain, and our hard experiences. Before we received this gift, we needed to understand that our blame was misplaced- God has always been a loving Father- it\u2019s our misinterpretation of Him & our lens that has shifted. \nYou\u2019ll have to sit with me here at our house & let me share all the details of God\u2019s goodness with you, b\/c I haven\u2019t even scratched the surface. \nYou are so welcome here 🤍\n#miraclehome #miracleshappen #beautiful\n#pandemic2020 #homesweethome","NumberOfLikes":91,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":30,"Timestamp":1598363885,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 15:58:05 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"💁🏻\u200D♀️👌😊❤️#pandemic2020  #covid_19","NumberOfLikes":7,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Cinthia Vale on August 25, 2020.

That's how you can remember us, we're like a ginger cookie. Everybody loves 'em, right?!\"\n\nThere are two kind of people in Inwood. Those who know and love Cookie and Ginger, and those who haven't met them yet. These two doyennes of the domain share decades of local history. They've seen this neighborhood through good & bad, boom & bust, high times and low. And always, always, they greet passersby with smiles and charm so winning that the busiest of us will take a few moments out of our day to stop and talk.\n\nWhich made seeing them the perfect capper to our trip back home. Like everyone, their style has been cramped by the pandemic. Being fans of live music and the nightlife in Norhtern Manhattan and the Bronx, they're often beckoned by bar owners and karaoke DJs to come spend a few hours at their establishment.  They'll send cars to come pick them up. They'll reserve bar stools. They'll buy them drinks. It's good business, but it's also just plain tradition. They don't pay for drinks, and they don't sing karaoke - but they'll loudly cheer everyone who does and they'll stay until late in the night.\n\nThe virus, of course, put the kibosh on all that. So for the time being, these two don their masks and park their chairs at the top of the 215th street stairs every evening, wishing travelers a safe journey out or welcoming them home for the night. Bartenders sometimes send a runner up the stairs with a couple refreshments. Those of us walking dogs stop and chew the fat. There are psychic scars left on this community from the casualties of early Spring. No one denies that. But Life. Goes. On. Because New York - and New Yorkers - endure.\n\n(Irony of ironies: Cookie showed me the pocket calendar she bought, the first she's ever owned, right at the start of 2020.

It\u2019s the last few weeks. It\u2019s a bitter sweet time of year for me, especially this one. It\u2019s been 90 plus pretty much all summer, during a pandemic. A FLIPPING PANDEMIC. Beyond hot and humid, trying to balance social distancing with an active 3 year old. Explaining we can see our family only, wearing masks everywhere, trying to make sure a little person who doesn\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening mental health is being tended to. Isolating him, keeping him and others safe, and all the while being judged for doing it. That\u2019s the culture we live in these days. Everyone thinks the know best not only for themselves but everyone else. Keyboard warriors. The cool thing is a long time ago I learned that what others think and say and feel about me isn\u2019t for me at all, it\u2019s for them. And that\u2019s a freedom I try tonnevee give away. There\u2019s so much much to what others are going through. Things aren\u2019t ever black and white. My job isn\u2019t to judge others but to stay in my lane and help my neighbor anyway i can. \nMy most favorite time of year coming to its end, but my runner up of fall is just on the horizon. I\u2019m starting to see pops of yellow, red, oranges in the trees. As the seasons change I\u2019m navigating covid 19 and life in general. Now I\u2019m gearing up for a new role of teacher. Juggling mom role, partner, business woman. Whoa. All while planning a wedding. Seasons are changing, and so am I. Squeezing in the last bits of summer, being where my feet are, and reminding myself to breathe and forever be grateful. #grateful #endlesssummer #summertime #falliscoming #momblogger #momsofinstagram #covidbride #2020bride #slayathomemom #momtruth #sobermom #sobermomtribe #stayingyourlane #wheremyfeetare #thankful #beagoodperson #keyboardwarrior #fallfoliage #slayathomemom #momtruth #parentinginapandemic #pandemic #pandemic2020 #homeschooling #homeschoollife #homeschoolmom #planningtime #weddingplanner #notmychairnotmyproblem","NumberOfLikes":10,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Giulia Cappadona on August 25, 2020.

However, a recent study📖 has suggested that it can also spread through faeces💩.\nHand sanitizer also proven to be effective in reducing the number and type of microbes.\nThere are two main types of hand sanitizers: \n🌼Alcohol-based⚗️: \nAlcohol-based hand sanitizers contain varying amounts and types of alcohol, often between 60 percent and 95 percent and usually isopropyl alcohol, ethanol (ethyl alcohol) or n-propanol. Alcohol is known to be able to kill most germs. \n🌼Alcohol-free⚗️:\nAlcohol-free hand sanitizers contain something called quarternary ammonium compounds (usually benzalkonium chloride) instead of alcohol. These can reduce microbes but are less effective than alcohol.\nNot only are alcohol-based hand sanitizers found to be effective at killing☠️ many types of bacteria🔬, including MRSA and E coli, they\u2019re also effective against many viruses, including the influenza A virus, rhinovirus, hepatitis A virus, HIV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).\n\n#covid19 #coronavirus #outbreak #pandemic2020\n#virus #sanitizers #effectiveness #alcohol\n#health #healthylifestyle #safetyfirst #chemistrylove\n#chemicalguys #sciencedaily\n#instagramposts #instagrampostdaily\n\nResources:https:\/\/www.thejakartapost.com\n\nDon't forget to subscribe my YouTube channel.

My handbag is full of gloves and masks and sanitizer and wipes and - you get the picture! I imagine it\u2019s much like carrying a diaper bag - filled with all of the things you might need at any given time 🤦🏼\u200D♀️. When I do dine out (and not order to-go) to support local restaurants, it\u2019s outside and on a \u201Cslower\u201D day of the week or when the restaurant first opens and always, lunch only. I\u2019ve seen the same friends - always outside, since March 15th and it\u2019s a small handful which makes me miss my entire squad terribly! I\u2019m a hugger and a people person so limited interaction is not natural. Like most of you, I\u2019m typically on the go, so this new pace and normal causes overthinking and anxiety. SO in this photo when I finally sat back and relaxed and was wrapping up my lunch (the furthest table from anyone else - of course seated way opposite from my friend) I looked down and saw the irony written on the table and couldn\u2019t resist the photo \u201Copportunity!\u201D We will get through this friends!!!

Before the pandemic hit, I felt as though I had a good rhythm of going to work and finding a fitness class to take with friends before coming home to cook dinner. \n\nWhen we entered quarantine and started working from home on the regular, my routine turned into crap. I was getting up 5 minutes before I had to start working. I no longer had a stand up desk since I was not at the office so I was sitting all day. I did not feel like moving my body after work especially since I was not meeting friends to do workouts and I was cooking whatever was easy, which usually meant not good nutrients for my body. All around I felt really shitty about myself. \n\nI knew I needed something to help me kickstart and get back into a routine that I could be consistent and comfortable with on a daily basis. Thank goodness I found an online accountability group of badass people that keep me feeling confident and hold me accountable to the routine I was looking to establish. \n\nSince joining this accountability group, I workout at home everyday and eat nutritious meals that help fuel my body. I am have more energy and all around I am a happier person. I even sleep better! \n\nBecause I have found so much success with establishing a better routine, I have decided to pay it forward, so I am looking to help people that could use more consistency in their routine to make healthier choices to feel better about themselves in this crazy time.

As famílias envolvidas no manejo das abelhas sem ferrão estão recebendo apoio técnico do projeto Floresta Ativa, uma iniciativa da ONG Projeto Saúde e Alegria.\n\nNo período de 18 a 20 de agosto, técnicos do Floresta Ativa fizeram uma viagem para diagnóstico da cadeia da meliponicultura na várzea. Foram visitadas famílias das comunidades Nova Vista, São José, Pixuna no Tapará, Tapará Mirim e Santa Maria do Tapará que praticam a meliponicultura. \n\nA intenção do PSA, segundo o técnico Alexandre Godinho é identificar com o mapeamento quais precisam de apoio em capacitação, kits de manejadores, e formação em práticas de manipulação e higiene.\n\n\u201CSerão apoiadas 100 famílias na várzea com aproximadamente mil enxames de abelhas sem ferrão. Por meio do resultado do diagnóstico produtivo será definida estratégia de produção na região\u201D, disse Godinho.\n\nA cadeia da meliponicultura compreende desde o uso de técnicas sustentáveis de bom manejo de abelhas sem ferrão para a produção do mel e seus derivados, como o pólen e o própolis, até o beneficiamento do produto e sua comercialização.\n\nSegundo o extensionista rural, Márcio Roberto que acompanhou a equipe nas comunidades do Ituqui e Tapará, o diagnóstico é fundamental para traçar medidas assertivas para uma produção de sucesso. \n\n\u201CO objetivo é apoiar a cadeia do mel para que ela se consolide e gere renda para as famílias que serão assistidas pelo PSA.
