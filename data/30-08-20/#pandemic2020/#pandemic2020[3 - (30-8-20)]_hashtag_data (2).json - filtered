I have a plethora of masks and face shields. I ordered in a small case of hand sanitizes or what we call at school \"hanitizer\u201D now if I could only get a good left foot (broke mine in a Red Lily Beetle battle . . . guess I lost). I got my \"things\" but am \"I\" ready? I worked at my school library throughout the pandemic with only a handful of people at the school. Schools in a covid-19 pandemic will look different. Not everything has been sorted out, but it will look different. No surprise there- most of 2020 has looked different. We are in this together and we will get through it together. One of my favorite words is HOPE. I've had to rely on hope and prayer throughout the last number of years. Some call,it a mantra and I call it my 'mindful or intentional words'. Here they are \"hope anchors the soul\" It races to my mind when \"worries voices starts chirping\" to silence him. What words\/phrases calm you down, focus your soul, and give your brain a rest?  Take a bit of time and grab some intentional words, they'll be ready when you need them.  School is not going to be the same when we get back. It's going to be better. We are adaptable and resilient folk who will do our best to create teaching moments like we've never had to create before. Our kids (and staff too) need community, need love and caring. They\u2019ll want us to understand that they feel many of the same feelings we do : apprehension, anxiety, uncertainty, but we also know we have the most resilient children too. Join the conversation about stress and fears, of expectations and anxiety together.

There is nothing to find, learn or gain there. See the opportunities in every day, see the interesting in every person. That is a choice we can make every day! Crisis or no crisis. \u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nüíü A few weeks back I was invited to a panel discussion about how entrepreneurs can cope with stress during the pandemic.\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nI am only sharing a small part of it here but I do applaud the hard work of the konsalidon  team and thesuperheroesproject .

In addition, dorms will be reopened with limited capacity and measures such as limited number of guests, social distancing, and mask policies in place. Reopening plans like this have already proven dangerous in other schools around the country, such as UNC-Chapel Hill, among others, which opened for a week before having a large outbreak and subsequent move to all online to prevent further spread. In an attempt to prevent this, UMKC has been doing a back-to-school safety drive to give students kits containing a mask, hand sanitizer, disinfecting wipes, and a card with measures to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. In addition, these tables are being used to hand out Student ID cards, usually handled in an office inside the UMKC Student Union, to help lower the number of people in the Student Union at one time. This has been a new process facilitated by having students email a picture for these cards rather than coming in to the Student Union and having these pictures taken.\n\nThe question of course remains, will this be enough?

So after we completed our masters together in Food and Nutrition we decided to set up our own health platform. Initially we would just work only on appointment basis as we were new and needed the funds to set up our own thing. Within a year and half of hardwork we managed to rent out our own space for clients. However life is no fairytale and soon we had to give up that space. We were now back to our style of working. It was then that my father in law offered me space in our house to set up my own clinic and Sruti got a similar space in her building and work started again. \n\nAnd just as we thought we were heading ahead lockdown began. With the spread of the pandemic things started becoming difficult for us. It became a task for us to adjust the timings of our clients over video calls and the work load piled up as the diets would be sent later over mail. The clients would often complain about filling up comprehensive forms and check their mails over and over again. But soon we came up with a whole pandemic package which was quick easy and very appealing to the clients. We now keep coming up with webinar\u2019s and exciting contests to keep our clients informed and engaged. And the constant positive feedback of our happy clients kept us motivated and we felt that all the hassle was every bit worth.\nWe are making sure it\u2019s a Happyylockdown for us and our clients as well. \n\n@healthyleap94 @srutiagarwal_ @suranasakshi","NumberOfLikes":32,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":6,"Timestamp":1598178871,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 12:34:31 CEST 2020","Location":"Kolkata - The City of Love"},{"CaptionText":"Summer is for fun, they say.

We played and we chatted. It felt like a little glimpse of pre-lockdown. Y\u2019know, when you could speak to strangers, share your kids snacks and toys and feel okay about it. \n\nI am so tired right now. Call it pandemic fatigue, call it whatever you want. \n\nI miss my son happily telling me what he did at nursery and all the friends he has made. I miss him never touching an iPad or watching endless hours of TV. I miss not having to put a mask on his face. \n\nI miss my parents not being anxious. I miss seeing people\u2019s smiling faces without a mask. Not just family, but strangers in the street. \n\nI miss being busy, going to birthday parties, going out for the day somewhere nice, entering a cafe and restaurant randomly rather than pre-booking etc. \n\nI miss the normalcy. \n\nSo don\u2019t feel like you have to pretend and keep pushing through.

Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. James 4:7\n\nAnd those he predestined, he also called;¬†those he called, he also justified;¬†those he justified, he also glorified. Romans 8:30\n\nAnd we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who ¬†have been called according to his purpose. Romans 8:28\n\nbut those who hope in the¬†Lord\nwill renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles;¬†they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.Isaiah 40:31\n\nBut he said to me, \u201CMy grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.\u201D Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 2 Corinthians 12:9\n\nAnd my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.

That's one word I would use to describe how I feel as a new mom right now. Covid-19(aka the Rona) robbed us of so much , all the plans we had made to celebrate being parents. Yes gage was born before quarantine, and I'm thankful I was able to have my family(mom husband and sister) with me in the hospital, I was able to have visitors. But since March, everything we planned on, has been ruined. All the firsts I had imagined for my sweet baby...ruined. things we can never get back. His first Easter. There was no family dinners it Easter egg hunt I always plan on my niece and nephew. There were no summer picnics where extended family was able to meet,hold, and love on my baby boy. They have only seen him grow via Skype or pictures shared on social media. There were no weddings where we got to attend and show off our little family and handsome little boy. They were either cancelled or we didn't go. There was a week we spent apart, just the baby and I, after daddy was in a wedding, while we waited for his covid test results to come in before he could home. A week filled with worry because I need to protect my baby and my mom, as well as my whole family. My sweet little one will be robbed of his first Halloween. There will be no trick or treat. I had a cute idea for he and my niece and nephew ...an idea that won't happen. His first Thanksgiving will be ruined, as well as his first Christmas. Yes I have \"traditions\" I can't wait to start with him, things I've dreamed about for years, but he won't get to spend it with family, grandparents, cousins, aunt's,uncle's. And his first birthday. It will most likely, at this rate, be just immediate family and a drive-by or zoom celebration for everyone else, not the big first birthday I imagined. Yes I know he won't remember any of this, but I will. It hurts. Covid robbed us of so much , and as a new mom it breaks my heart. The daily anxiety attacks, Everytime I go to the store or to work. The constant worry \"am I bringing the virus home to my baby? My mom?\". The feeling like my heart is beating through my chest and I can't breathe because of fear.

Today I\u2019m going to break down some of the information on schooling within K-12 as well as the college university scene (what I am currently living in)\n\nK-12:\n1. Online education for students forces parents to handle child care, education, and their own jobs all at once\n2. Only 1 in 7 parents say their children will be returning to school full time. If given the option, most parents do not feel comfortable sending their children back to school with these conditions.\n3. Teachers are scared for their health and safety, and thousands have resigned throughout the country.\n4. Many teachers recommended postponing the school year and believe that going back to school is happening too soon.\n5. Home schooling is becoming an increasingly more popular option as a result of the pandemic.\n\nCollege:\n1. One of the biggest threats to COVID outbreaks is large social gatherings, and in college this stems from parties, fraternities, and sororities. These groups are causing major outbreaks at schools, causing some colleges to move online for at least 2 weeks to prevent the spread, and for some to move completely virtual, like UNC-Chapel Hill\n2. All college football has been suspended for this season besides the SEC.\n3. Most universities have a variety of class options ranging from in-person to hybrid to fully online.\n4. There\u2019s been a major drop in foreign\/ international students attending colleges in America and many incoming freshmen opted to take a gap year as well. \n\nOverall, I just want to remind y\u2019all to stay safe, be smart, and wear a mask! The only way we can stop the spread of COVID-19 is to be proactive about staying safe, limiting our contact with others, and social distancing. This pandemic will not go on forever, and it\u2019s important to remember that eventually life will return to \u201Cnormal\u201D. Even though it can seem like everything is ruined in the moment\/ there\u2019s nothing to look forward to, it\u2019s important to remind yourself that by doing the right thing and staying safe you are helping yourself, your loved ones, your community, and your world","NumberOfLikes":183,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Elli Feingold in University of Georgia with @closecallstudio, @georgiatech, @uncchapelhill, @nyuniversity, @sec, @universityofga, and @secnetwork.

The first time I saw Calgary it was a ghost town. When my eyes met Banff, the gates were closed. No longer was the world open with possibilities, it was asking us to hunker down. \n\nThe strange thing is, I\u2019ve done this before. I\u2019ve been in recovery from illnesses that took months. It asked me to stay still. Even on days I felt I could expand, I stayed still to heal. \n\nCase numbers are going up, and I\u2019m staying still. Waiting. Preserving. Because anyone with a compromised immune system knows that viruses have no mercy on people like us. \n\nI\u2019m again reminded, of the underground city that lies below Edinburgh. There was a figure in black, a mask with a beak. He stood over a woman holding her child in a cramped room. Her eyes, as if it was the end. \n\nThe guide said death was a part of life when the plague came. Death is a part of any lifetime. Inevitable in all its form. Embedded in the strings of life. \n\nMuch like life in the underground city, I hung the laundry on the banister, strung up like a line of flags charting the way. \n\nBecause when all is said and done, it\u2019s these simple moments of life that we will remember. \n\nThe little things that made life feel okay, when the world felt dark.","NumberOfLikes":19,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Bethany Jane on August 22, 2020.

The majority of recently produced masks will not block a virus the size of a corona variety - you should not be sneezing, coughing, or spitting on a room to begin with (!). Covid-19 has killed many, I will never deny that it has been dangerous to an extent- but the mortality rate is astonishingly lower than the common flu. The rumor in Interior Alaska is that we had the virus during our normal flu season, and nobody noticed the difference. Masks are a symbol of shame and fear throughout history, and, right now, are proof that the American people are willing to let mass media make crucial decisions for them. Stop the fear. Save our jobs and our businesses. Stop teaching our children to let the newscasters speak for the nation. #mediapandemic #covid19 #covid_19 #covid #covidusa #alaska #fairbanksalaska #covidak #covidalaska #mask #maskfashion #pandemic #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife #antimask #covidmemes #covidmeme #covidmasks #plaguemask #school #school2020 #university #college #freedomofspeech","NumberOfLikes":2,"Hashtags":["#mediapandemic","#covid19","#covid_19","#covid","#covidusa","#alaska","#fairbanksalaska","#covidak","#covidalaska","#mask","#maskfashion","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#pandemiclife","#antimask","#covidmemes","#covidmeme","#covidmasks","#plaguemask","#school","#school2020","#university","#college","#freedomofspeech"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by A.

You are showing others that you care and are kind.

Sadly though, this virus doesn\u2019t discriminate and I know people that were perfectly healthy and are now still suffering from it. \nJust an observation on my part, but I\u2019ve walked across so many older people and noticed that they feel more at ease when they see others with their mask on. Ofcourse there\u2019s always the few that will just give you a funny stare thinking you are scared. I am not scared of the virus. I\u2019m wearing a mask to protect you incase I do happen to have the virus.

In response, I looked for as much information as possible on COVID-19 to try to map out a course for a return to normalcy how things would progress. I dutifully read news articles and obsessively checked the Johns Hopkins Covid-19 map, even taking screenshots so I could remember how the data was changing.¬†When we locked down, I thought, \"It's fine, I've been socially distancing most of my adult life. I'm not a people person; I'm built for this! Besides, I know a lot about economics, and I can help! I will research some theories to prevent a local economic meltdown. Maybe I'll even learn how to build custom cabinets!\u201D I thought I was optimistic.¬†Here's what I've learned:\n.\n1. Distracting yourself from things out of your control is a fool\u2019s errand. All of my plans in the early stages of the COVID pandemic weren't based in optimism, they were purely rooted in coping via distraction. I was gorging on information until I was literally too tired to think of anything else. I wanted to say \u201CGoodbye COVID fears and worries, there is no vacancy here!¬†This brain is full of thoughts on modern monetary theory, history of school facility design, vaccine trials, designs for a she-shed, homemade bread, aromatherapy, classical literature, gardening, woodworking or anything else, really.\u201D It didn\u2019t work and I'm exhausted.\n.\n2. We all need to find our own ways to disconnect and quiet our thoughts. This is really challenging for me, but I'm working on it. For me, there are two things that bring me peace: music and water.¬†So, I've banned podcasts and news talk from my morning walks. I have replaced the chatter with music. I have also taken up 5AM swims (sometimes just splashing around and doing handstands and flips in the water as I did as a kid). The pool is quiet and empty at that hour and it's dark, so there are no distractions.\n.\nWe live in a constant cycle of calm and chaos and sometimes the information that seems so helpful is too plentiful to function as anything more than consistent static.
