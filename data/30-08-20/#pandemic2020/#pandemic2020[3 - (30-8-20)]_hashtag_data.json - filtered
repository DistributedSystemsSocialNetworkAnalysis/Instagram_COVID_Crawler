This initiative will provide health and hygiene items such as bleach, soap, and over-the-counter medicines, in addition to foods, such as rice, cooking oil, spaghetti, flour, sugar, oats, potatoes, salt, tea, and canned milk to supplement the crops the people grow and the fish they catch. The generous size of the TWFF contribution will provide enough supplies to last the communities for FOUR months.\n\nWe at the NBHF are immensely grateful and humbled to be selected to receive such a significant donation.

The greatest propaganda network ever created! The story I had shared was about a new pandemic documentary that put forward some very interesting ideas and research. And yet after people went to reply to what I had posted, Instagram hid the post, claimed the story was unavailable and that my account was private. What?!

I have a plethora of masks and face shields. I ordered in a small case of hand sanitizes or what we call at school \"hanitizer\u201D now if I could only get a good left foot (broke mine in a Red Lily Beetle battle . . . guess I lost). I got my \"things\" but am \"I\" ready? I worked at my school library throughout the pandemic with only a handful of people at the school. Schools in a covid-19 pandemic will look different. Not everything has been sorted out, but it will look different. No surprise there- most of 2020 has looked different. We are in this together and we will get through it together. One of my favorite words is HOPE. I've had to rely on hope and prayer throughout the last number of years. Some call,it a mantra and I call it my 'mindful or intentional words'. Here they are \"hope anchors the soul\" It races to my mind when \"worries voices starts chirping\" to silence him. What words\/phrases calm you down, focus your soul, and give your brain a rest?  Take a bit of time and grab some intentional words, they'll be ready when you need them.  School is not going to be the same when we get back. It's going to be better. We are adaptable and resilient folk who will do our best to create teaching moments like we've never had to create before. Our kids (and staff too) need community, need love and caring. They\u2019ll want us to understand that they feel many of the same feelings we do : apprehension, anxiety, uncertainty, but we also know we have the most resilient children too. Join the conversation about stress and fears, of expectations and anxiety together.

Good or bad we cannot but that doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t prepare for it!  Christmas is only a few short months away!  Sorry to bring that up! \n*\nBefore coaching, I never really had a plan for Christmas! Black Friday would arrive and we would always have the conversation about should we spend less or accrue some credit card debt again? Umm, my love language is gift giving so you know which way I went! I would seriously not even look at our credit card statement until January! üòÇ Please don\u2019t judge! And then the first couple months of the year I was a stress case until it was paid off! \n*\nIf you\u2019re in this situation, I would love to talk!  Whether is extra money for groceries! Paying for your kids college!  Or just having an extra date night!  Helping others with their health and fitness has openned so many doors for us! Just so you know, I now save $100 from my weekly paycheck for our Christmas Spending! üòÇ Such a better way to live!\n*\nIf you have a heart to serve others while working on your own health and fitness goals I would love to talk!  Don\u2019t wait for something bad to happen! It feels so good to be proactive!\n*\n*\n*\nTo make compliance happy I have to add: Beachbody does not guarantee any level of success or income from the Team Beachbody Coach Opportunity.  Each coaches income depends on his or her efforts, diligence and skills.","NumberOfLikes":113,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Melissa French on August 23, 2020.

Families will be at the frontlines witnessing how their children are learning.  This is powerful and I have been strongly advocating that we need to pay attention to our younger kids for this reason.  If you want to be anti-racist in your classroom and school, then demand accountability from leadership that teachers need to be trained in the science of reading so we have a reading proficiency in our country that reaches ALL students.  When this happens, you are teaching ALL students.  You are teaching students with special needs and students from diverse backgrounds.  1 in 5 kids can and more than likely be diagnosed with dyslexia.  The criminal justice system in this country is broken, but when studying the inmates there is a huge correlation with dyslexia and literacy rates.

In addition, dorms will be reopened with limited capacity and measures such as limited number of guests, social distancing, and mask policies in place. Reopening plans like this have already proven dangerous in other schools around the country, such as UNC-Chapel Hill, among others, which opened for a week before having a large outbreak and subsequent move to all online to prevent further spread. In an attempt to prevent this, UMKC has been doing a back-to-school safety drive to give students kits containing a mask, hand sanitizer, disinfecting wipes, and a card with measures to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. In addition, these tables are being used to hand out Student ID cards, usually handled in an office inside the UMKC Student Union, to help lower the number of people in the Student Union at one time. This has been a new process facilitated by having students email a picture for these cards rather than coming in to the Student Union and having these pictures taken.\n\nThe question of course remains, will this be enough?

Also it's important to eat healthy food , vegetables and food rich in vitamin C to boost our immunity . Stay away from unhealthy food and try to cook as much as you can at home and carry it to work. \n\nStaying away from parties or crowded places should be kept in mind always. \n\nAs I don't work in a hospital or not looking after Covid patients , so I am using reusable cloth masks , you can make them at home or buy them based on your need. They are much more sustainable and economical. \n\nSo if you guys are interested in mask reviews ,comment down below and I will show some of the cloth masks that I am using during this pandemic and share my experience . \n\n#wearyourmask #pandemic2020 #stayhome #staysafe #eatvitaminceveryday #boostyourimmunity #wearclothmasks #savetheoceans #sustainableliving","NumberOfLikes":28,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Tripti Mukherjee on August 22, 2020 tagging @vastramay.

This entire year has both flown by and remained frozen at the same time. This morning I was thinking about how I never in my wildest dreams would think we would have to live our daily lives wearing face masks and living in constant fear. I rarely leave my house anyway,  but there is a difference between it being my choice to stay isolated and being forced to be. For those with debilating mental illness this swift change of life has been even more difficult. \nüíä\nBeing dumped by the love of my life of 18 years in 2014, losing my career of 10 years in 2016, losing all the friends that I made there, becoming disabled due to mental illness, a suicide attempt\/hospitalization last October, and then my dad passing away last November after a 2 year battle with cancer has been overwhelming to say the least. I've dealt with all of that, by hiding in my room. The fear of ever getting too close to anyone ever again, is so strong, that I would rather spend the rest of my days alone than ever allow myself to be hurt like that ever again. \nüè°\nI'm lonely sometimes, and wish I still had parties with friends, someone to share my experiences with, or even someplace to go when I need a change of scenery, but my peace of mind is worth more.  Parasocial relationships are the way of the future, I feel safe there.  #summer #dogdaysofsummer #pandemiclife \n.\n.\n.\n.\n#mentalhealth #coronavirus #lifestyle #friendship #loss #cancer #death #fired #divorce #heartbroken #disabled #disability #isolation #Depresion #bipolar #fear #pain #cutslikeaknife #sadness #relationships #familyovereverything #hurt #storytime #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife","NumberOfLikes":7,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1598150808,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 04:46:48 CEST 2020","Location":"Chesterfield County, Virginia"},{"CaptionText":"For everyone days or night #covid19 #friends #family #ordernow #youandme #pandemic2020 $10.00  only  TextNow üòä","NumberOfLikes":6,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1598150752,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 04:45:52 CEST 2020","Location":"Atlanta, Georgia"},{"CaptionText":"Tuhkan.....mbaknya senengüòÅüòÅüòò\nTerimakasih sudah mempercayakan kepada kami @keenanfloristmagelang \nüôèüôèüôè\n\nFast respon 081578019011\n\n#magelanghits\n#buketbunga\n#buketbungamagelang\n#buketbungawisuda\n#buketmawarmagelang\n#mawarmerah\n#buketmawar\n#buketwisuda\n#pandemic2020\n#buketbungalamaran\n#engagement\n#lamaran\n#magelang","NumberOfLikes":6,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by karangan bunga papan magelang on August 22, 2020.

At the very end, he told the most impactful story.  One I hadn\u2019t heard before.  I saved the clip and have listened to it a few times since.  It is so profound, I decided to share it here.\n\nHere is my re-telling if the story:\n\nA man was in his garden where he noticed a butterfly struggling to emerge from its cocoon.  He watched as it worked a small hole into the cocoon with its legs but that hole was not big enough for its body to fit through.  It struggled for some time and then went completely still, seemingly exhausted.\nü¶ã\nWanting to help, the old man decided to open the hole in the cocoon up larger.  The butterfly was able to emerge but instead of flying away, it fell to the ground. \nü¶ã\nWhat the man didn\u2019t know was that the effort required to emerge from a cocoon is nature\u2019s way of strengthening the butterfly\u2019s wings and preparing it to fly. \nü¶ã\nI love this reminder that sometimes we have to struggle and trudge uphill through hardship in order to reach our destiny.  Often, the extra effort required to overcome obstacles is what prepares us for navigating life\u2019s challenges.\nü¶ã\nLooking back on the past 6 months after hearing this story, I started to reframe the narrative in my head.  The obstacles of #covid19 and decreased work hours and home school and cancelled plans are the expert\u2019s course in overcoming challenges.  I am looking forward to breaking free from this cocoon and flying high! \n.\n.\n#jasminestarr #jasminestarpodcast #kencolemanshow #lessonofthebutterfly #pandemic2020 #covid19 #coronahomeschool #virtuallearning #virtuallearning2020 #overcomingobstacles #challenge #motivation #inspiration","NumberOfLikes":21,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Dr. Anne Sharkey in Leander, Texas.

Even though it is arrived the latest since 2005, the delay was not based on our own efforts but was forced by the disaster of coronavirus pandemic. It is nothing to be celebrated; instead, it is something to remind us : Do we want to be suppressed or do we want to decide on our own? Perhaps Earth Overshoot Day is not 100% precise or 100% reflecting the real situation, it definitely gives us an indication of how great impact we have over our environment.

The first time I saw Calgary it was a ghost town. When my eyes met Banff, the gates were closed. No longer was the world open with possibilities, it was asking us to hunker down. \n\nThe strange thing is, I\u2019ve done this before. I\u2019ve been in recovery from illnesses that took months. It asked me to stay still. Even on days I felt I could expand, I stayed still to heal. \n\nCase numbers are going up, and I\u2019m staying still. Waiting. Preserving. Because anyone with a compromised immune system knows that viruses have no mercy on people like us. \n\nI\u2019m again reminded, of the underground city that lies below Edinburgh. There was a figure in black, a mask with a beak. He stood over a woman holding her child in a cramped room. Her eyes, as if it was the end. \n\nThe guide said death was a part of life when the plague came. Death is a part of any lifetime. Inevitable in all its form. Embedded in the strings of life. \n\nMuch like life in the underground city, I hung the laundry on the banister, strung up like a line of flags charting the way. \n\nBecause when all is said and done, it\u2019s these simple moments of life that we will remember. \n\nThe little things that made life feel okay, when the world felt dark.","NumberOfLikes":19,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Bethany Jane on August 22, 2020.

The majority of recently produced masks will not block a virus the size of a corona variety - you should not be sneezing, coughing, or spitting on a room to begin with (!). Covid-19 has killed many, I will never deny that it has been dangerous to an extent- but the mortality rate is astonishingly lower than the common flu. The rumor in Interior Alaska is that we had the virus during our normal flu season, and nobody noticed the difference. Masks are a symbol of shame and fear throughout history, and, right now, are proof that the American people are willing to let mass media make crucial decisions for them. Stop the fear. Save our jobs and our businesses. Stop teaching our children to let the newscasters speak for the nation. #mediapandemic #covid19 #covid_19 #covid #covidusa #alaska #fairbanksalaska #covidak #covidalaska #mask #maskfashion #pandemic #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife #antimask #covidmemes #covidmeme #covidmasks #plaguemask #school #school2020 #university #college #freedomofspeech","NumberOfLikes":2,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by A.

In response, I looked for as much information as possible on COVID-19 to try to map out a course for a return to normalcy how things would progress. I dutifully read news articles and obsessively checked the Johns Hopkins Covid-19 map, even taking screenshots so I could remember how the data was changing.¬†When we locked down, I thought, \"It's fine, I've been socially distancing most of my adult life. I'm not a people person; I'm built for this! Besides, I know a lot about economics, and I can help! I will research some theories to prevent a local economic meltdown. Maybe I'll even learn how to build custom cabinets!\u201D I thought I was optimistic.¬†Here's what I've learned:\n.\n1. Distracting yourself from things out of your control is a fool\u2019s errand. All of my plans in the early stages of the COVID pandemic weren't based in optimism, they were purely rooted in coping via distraction. I was gorging on information until I was literally too tired to think of anything else. I wanted to say \u201CGoodbye COVID fears and worries, there is no vacancy here!¬†This brain is full of thoughts on modern monetary theory, history of school facility design, vaccine trials, designs for a she-shed, homemade bread, aromatherapy, classical literature, gardening, woodworking or anything else, really.\u201D It didn\u2019t work and I'm exhausted.\n.\n2. We all need to find our own ways to disconnect and quiet our thoughts. This is really challenging for me, but I'm working on it. For me, there are two things that bring me peace: music and water.¬†So, I've banned podcasts and news talk from my morning walks. I have replaced the chatter with music. I have also taken up 5AM swims (sometimes just splashing around and doing handstands and flips in the water as I did as a kid). The pool is quiet and empty at that hour and it's dark, so there are no distractions.\n.\nWe live in a constant cycle of calm and chaos and sometimes the information that seems so helpful is too plentiful to function as anything more than consistent static. I'm learning to meter my intake and find ways to just \u201Csit\u201D with myself.\n- Amy¬†Ruthrauff-McWhorter¬†| 7\/20\/20","NumberOfLikes":6,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598045423,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 23:30:23 CEST 2020","Location":"Austin, Texas"},{"CaptionText":"#getinspired üî•\n-\n-\n-\n-\n#fitness #fightcovid19 #fitnessmotivation #fitnessgirl #fitgirl #fitnessaddict #bodybuilding #bodypositive #muscle #muscleup #girlsgeneration #girlswithmuscle #getlikes #workoutfit #workoutoftheday #sculpbodywomen #pandemic2020 #lesmills #likeforlikes #likeforlikeback #followforfollowback #likeforfollow #healthylifestyle #me #healthychoices #modelstyle #bodybuildingmotivation #lifeisgood","NumberOfLikes":97,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Aninha Sousa_PT in Monumental Fitness Club with @polarglobal, @reebokeurope, and @reebok.

Oak Grove Park was selected and approval was given to install the world\u2019s first Disc Golf Course. In 1975, \u201CSteady\u201D Ed installed the first official disc golf course at¬†Oak Grove Park¬†in Pasadena, Los Angeles County, California, with the targets being nothing more than permanent poles placed into the ground. As you can imagine, this brought about many disagreements, so a new way of catching the disc resulted. In 1976 Ed replaced the poles with the first DGA Disc Pole Hole, that were the first disc golf targets to use chains to stop a disc. Which later on became one of many patented disc encatchment devices. Thank you Steady for have the vision and determination to push forward and leave us the great sport of dis golf we know and love today.\n\nPandemic Disc Golf Apparel.
