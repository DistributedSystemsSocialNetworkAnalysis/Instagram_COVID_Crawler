Oak Grove Park was selected and approval was given to install the world\u2019s first Disc Golf Course. In 1975, \u201CSteady\u201D Ed installed the first official disc golf course at Oak Grove Park in Pasadena, Los Angeles County, California, with the targets being nothing more than permanent poles placed into the ground. As you can imagine, this brought about many disagreements, so a new way of catching the disc resulted. In 1976 Ed replaced the poles with the first DGA Disc Pole Hole, that were the first disc golf targets to use chains to stop a disc. Which later on became one of many patented disc encatchment devices.

Gavin Newsom said that schools must provide instruction remotely unless their counties have been off the state\u2019s coronavirus \u201Cwatchlist\u201D for two weeks straight.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nBut in Florida, an emergency order requires all schools to open at least five days a week, subject to the orders of state and local health authorities. Schools must serve both families who want full-time, in-person schooling AND parents who prefer remote. \n(Data via EdWeek.org)\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nIn this weekend's Special Edition Saturday episode of The NewsWorthy, we talked to a pediatrician about the pandemic's impact on children.

Vamos deixar de lado um pouco a covid e lembrar que não é novidade que a prática de exercício físico e ponderação na alimentação trazem benefícios à saúde.

The masks? Children home from everything? Not enough time in the day? 🤚 Too much time? The politics? The fear? Maybe the lack of TP! \n\nLast night I fed my kids Mr Noodles for dinner so I could work out. \nThat was my coping. I haven\u2019t been consistent because somebody or some animal is usually in need of ALL OF my time. \nI had to make a sacrifice somewhere because I crave working out. It gives me that wonderful release of endorphins. It makes me feel accomplished. It makes me feel strong and healthy and happy. I\u2019ve been ignoring my body\u2019s unhappiness in order to give to others. \n\nMy back has been sore from being unprotected from my weak core muscles, working nights and lifting patients. There is more to me that touches uncomfortably and gets in the way of other things. My body wants to run, wants to move. Wants to feel exerted. \nFarm work and riding and a leisurely bike ride aren\u2019t enough for me, I need that strenuous physical activity. \n\nSo last night instead of cooking a meal from scratch, I let the kids have Mr Noodles. And it\u2019s totally ok. ONCE IN AWHILE. \nEven with that, I didn\u2019t have time to change into workout clothes, put a bra on, warm up or cool down. (Well I kind of cooled down as I showered for my third night shift.) \nBut I spent 20 minutes working a sweat, and I was so glad I did! \n\nWhat have you been doing to cope with the new pandemic challenges? \n\n#copingstrategies #sparetime #momof4kids #pandemicparenting #covidworkout #mentalhealthmatters #healthyliving #changeyourmindsetchangeyourlife #pandemic2020 #countyourblessings #justdoit✔ #noexcusesmom","NumberOfLikes":17,"Hashtags":["#copingstrategies","#sparetime","#momof4kids","#pandemicparenting","#covidworkout","#mentalhealthmatters","#healthyliving","#changeyourmindsetchangeyourlife","#pandemic2020","#countyourblessings","#justdoit✔","#noexcusesmom"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Sherri M Latimer on August 21, 2020.

The bench, headed by Justice Sanjay K Kaul, took a grim view of such unsubstantiated claims and the very filing of such a PIL in the apex court.\n\nIt was of the view that the direction sought in Gyantara's PIL were completely misconceived and that it was time to send a message that people should not approach a court with such contentions.\n\nThe bench, which also had Justices Ajay Rastogi and Aniruddha Bose, further noted that the primary consideration of the petitioner in filing such a petition seemed to be getting some attention and publicity.\n\n\"We are of the view that such kind of petitions must be stopped as anybody and everybody thinks they have some cure for the situation,\" it maintained.\n\nThe court, in its order on Thursday, added that such petitioners seek to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution, possibly only to gain some publicity.\n\n\"Such wastage of judicial time is completely inappropriate,\" held the bench. It then dismissed the writ petition with cost of Rs 10,000 to be deposited by Gyantara with the Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Welfare Fund within four weeks.\nSource @cnnnews18 \n#medical #aayurveda #aayurvedic #medicine #supremcourtofindia #fine #legaleducation #legalsaurav #thehindu #thewire #covıd19 #coronavirus #homelife #pandemic2020 #amarujala #doctor #consitution #fakeclaim #aayushmantralay #writs #lawyers #advocate #delhiblogger #haryana #haryanameme #beaware #stayupdated #legal #legalupdates #mumbai","NumberOfLikes":173,"Hashtags":["#medical","#aayurveda","#aayurvedic","#medicine","#supremcourtofindia","#fine","#legaleducation","#legalsaurav","#thehindu","#thewire","#covıd19","#coronavirus","#homelife","#pandemic2020","#amarujala","#doctor","#consitution","#fakeclaim","#aayushmantralay","#writs","#lawyers","#advocate","#delhiblogger","#haryana","#haryanameme","#beaware","#stayupdated","#legal","#legalupdates","#mumbai"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Legal Saurav (🎯 10K) in Haryana.

And that makes it even more important to focus on gratitude instead. \n.\nIt is easy to concentrate on your silver linings. Just take a few moments every day to reflect on all that you have. All the things that are going well and all the reasons that make you smile every day.\n.\nFocus on all your blessings - a loving family to spend the lockdown with, a roof over your head to stay in with them, the food on your table when the world is facing a huge economic crisis and most importantly, your health and the hope in your heart that keeps you going. \n.\nJust being mindful of all that you have will make you appreciate your life and help you stay positive through and beyond this pandemic.

The no-alarm mornings. Those days when we didn\u2019t have to hit the snooze or the off button and slept for as long as we liked.\n\n2. When shows on Netflix and Prime were mostly binged on during the day while the late night hours were exclusively allocated to video calls, chats, and Ludo King.\n\n3. Those morning or evening walks which didn\u2019t need a workout playlist. The silence from having less people on the road, the birds chirping, the leaves rustling, became all the music we would ever need. \n\n4. Movie Sessions with the whole family when Mom would see the rating of the movie on Netflix and immediately say, \u201CThat movie has s... search for another one.\u201D No amount of whining and the assurance to forward \u2018those\u2019 scenes would change her mind. \n\n5. When everyone at home took turns to beat the brains out of coffee, sugar, and water for the perfect Dalgona coffee. \n\n6. The way we flaunted our cooking skills when we \u2018managed\u2019 to make Dosa. Or chappathi? And we hated all those who replied with a photo and an annoying caption- \u201CChicken Pot Biryani: made by me.\u201D\n\n7. When most of us finally got the time to pick up that pen and write down that poem, or to pick up that guitar and sing that song, pick up that book and finish reading it, or just pick up nothing and enjoy being ourselves. Like I said, finally!\n\n8. The clear starry sky which freed itself from volumes of pollution and became the best piece of art to be created. \n\n9. The phone calls we could make after years, the conversations we could complete, the people to whom we could tell how much we love them after much procrastination.\n\n10. The friendships we found in unexpected places, in unexpected people and in unexpected ways which we strongly hope would remain with us forever.\n@sharylss \n.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nPC: @noone.su \nSHARE YOUR FAVOURITE LOCKDOWN MEMORIES IN THE COMMENTS SECTION. \n.\n#writersofinstagram #writingcommunity #writing #writings #write #writer #writerscommunity #writersofig #writeaway #writersblock #writersnetwork #writeaway #writerssociety #writersuniverse #writersporn #lockdown2020 #lockdown #lockdownlife #covid19 #covid_19 #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife","NumberOfLikes":35,"Hashtags":["#writersofinstagram","#writingcommunity","#writing","#writings","#write","#writer","#writerscommunity","#writersofig","#writeaway","#writersblock","#writersnetwork","#writeaway","#writerssociety","#writersuniverse","#writersporn","#lockdown2020","#lockdown","#lockdownlife","#covid19","#covid_19","#pandemic2020","#pandemiclife"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Sharyl Sodadasi in Listicle.

Try to limit screen time at night.\n\n🔹Follow 20-20-20 rule: For every 20 minutes spent using a screen, you should try to look away at something that is 20 feet away from you for a total of 20 seconds.\n\n🔹Nourish them with right nutrition: All the above tips will work only if you eat foods that help in better vision which includes: \n\n🌽🥕🥬Green leafy, yellow, red and orange color fruits and vegetables which are rich in beta carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin\n\n🍓🍊Berries and Citrus fruits which are packed with vit C\n\n🥜Nuts like almonds which will provide zinc and vit E\n\n🍣Salmon and other fatty fishes for Omega -3 fatty acids \n\nMost of the mentioned nutrients like vit A, vit C,  vit E act as antioxidants.

The estimate includes parents who have already left the workforce as well as those who are at risk of losing their jobs...\n\nSo-called shadow joblessness, defined as Americans who have stopped looking for work, spiked to 8 million at the peak of the pandemic, and remains 5 million above pre-crisis levels, according to Bloomberg Economics. School closures will continue to impact this number, especially the labor force participation rate for women, who generally take on a greater share of childcare obligations.\n\nBUT HERE IS WHAT YOU CAN DO\n\nIn order to stay afloat in these difficult times you have to be creative and passionate about generating extra income for you and your family...\n\nBelow we have a few resources and ideas that other parents and spouses are discovering and using to generate extra income from home during the pandemic...\n\nREFERRAL MARKETING\nThis is where companies pay you for referring client who signs up for their services...\n\nThe catch...you must sign up too, but its free!!!\n\nHere are our TOP 2.. \n\n1.

I have felt the uncertainty of having no routine or schedule. I experienced loneliness without my family and close friends but also relief in times of solitude. I've felt stressed trying to manage the demands of my work with that of John's (extra busy) work and the boys' needs. And stressed when work came to a standing hault. I hardly ever felt at peace and almost always felt like I was failing as a mother, wife, friend and business owner. \u2063\n\u2063\nSomehow, something switched inside of me this week and my brain finally figured it out. I'm able to prioritize my needs both emotionally and physically and have found solice in how, and with who, I spend my time with. \u2063\n\u2063\nOf course, as I'm finally figuring this all out, I'm faced with a new reality of back to school and all of the unknowns associated with that. It's on the horizon and in the back of my mind, but for now I'm going to try and focus on the NOW and relish these special times with my kids. \u2063\n\u2063\nDespite the craziness of having them home with me 24\/7 for 4+ months and the (extra) yelling, I'm really enjoying this extra time I have with them. \u2063\n\u2063\n\/\/ 𝐇𝐚𝐯𝐞 𝐈 𝐥𝐨𝐬𝐭 𝐢𝐭?

Most people infected will experience a mild to moderate respiratory illness, whilst others will show no symptoms at all. However for some the effects are severe and longer lasting.\n\nTheir aim in this yoga programme is to play some role in aiding the process of recovery. By only requiring the use of mostly basic props and furniture, they have tried to make the poses as accessible as possible for everyone.\n\nThe programme was compiled thanks to advice and guidance from Abhijata Iyengar, Lois Steinberg, Gulnaaz Dashti, Stephanie Quirk, the IY(UK) Therapy Committee, IY(UK) teachers who have experienced the virus themselves, and decades of work by BKS Iyengar and Dr Geeta S. Iyengar in medical classes at RIMYI in Pune.\n\nSee the link in their bio to access the video and booklet, which are both freely available. Please consider donating a contribution towards this and future Iyengar yoga therapy resources 🙏\n\nThanks to all involved in creating the programme and to @adrienne_karmaspaceyoga for designing the e-book\n\n#iyengaryoga #yogatherapy #covid19 #covid_19 #coronavirus #recovery #covidhelp #yogaforhealing #yoga #mypandemicsurvivalplan #sarscov2 #pandemic #pandemic2020 #staysafe #virus #postcovid #yogapractice #loveyoga #yogateachers  #iyengarmethod #yogadaily #practiceyoga #yogisofinstagram #yogajourney #wellnesswednesday","NumberOfLikes":4,"Hashtags":["#iyengaryoga","#yogatherapy","#covid19","#covid_19","#coronavirus","#recovery","#covidhelp","#yogaforhealing","#yoga","#mypandemicsurvivalplan","#sarscov2","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#staysafe","#virus","#postcovid","#yogapractice","#loveyoga","#yogateachers","#iyengarmethod","#yogadaily","#practiceyoga","#yogisofinstagram","#yogajourney","#wellnesswednesday"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Yuval Yoga on August 20, 2020.

Writing was captivating & writers have used the lockdown period & it's effects at its best. Whole premises set around COVID 19 doesn't look like a gimmick at all. It's looks very authentic till the end. Screenplay was full of heart thumping scenes. You can easily see depth in character because of the outstanding writing. \n\nShow is packed with hell lot of twists & at the end you will crave for more. This series is written, shot in lockdown, so you can clearly see there's no combined scenes of characters & thanks to razor sharp editing to make things very crispy. Show direction in online investigation scenes was clap worthy. In this show you can easily see that social media & internet can do anything. The use of social media has its own different merits & demerits. Events are neat & nothing looks unreal at all.\n\n@battatawada I'm speechless. I have reviewed your every show & film. Shweta performance in investigation scenes was gripping. @sanjaykapoor2500 intensity was sweaty in dramatic scenes. @shriya.pilgaonkar was convincing as suhani. @arjun__mathur you are everywhere on OTT, man I loved your act in last episode. Excited to see you in S2. @dibyenduofficial cameo was good. @indraneilsengupta @rukhsarrehman was also good.\n\nPlot around sahil's covid 19 was looking very rushed & few things were immersive.\n\nShow BGM gave me thrilling experience. The gone game has almost everything which shows us that a good story don't need high budget, big sets or normal surroundings. A good story can be narrate very easily with the help of excellent team & big courage.

I\u2019ve always wanted bangs, but never wanted to commit to the work required to style\u2019em every day. I\u2019m more of a wash & go kinda a girl to my mom\u2019s dismay! Even my stylists have dissuaded me in the past...well, I didn\u2019t even own a blow dryer so they had a point! 🤪 \n\nBut with much of the industry shut down due to covid, why not make lemonade? Or lemon bars! I get to change my \u2018do & not stress too much about looking exactly like my haircut for a change! I had to get the same \u2018pretty girl\u2019 haircut (read: long layers) as one of my stylists dubbed it for most of my career. I\u2019m still committed to the craft but I\u2019m also recommitting to myself. A chance to explore all the little things I\u2019ve wanted to do but put off due to pragmatism.\n\nGrowing up with a lot of emphasis on my appearance, I always felt a resistance to doing anything but the bare minimum to keep it up. But that\u2019s punishing myself for the way others chose to construct my identity\/value me, right? Taking that extra time to style my bangs has given me the opportunity to give myself that extra care that I always felt guilty\/weird for doing. How odd, that such small things can become big things.\n\nre: coping mechanisms...we all have them to a certain degree. Any time we replace an action\/object\/person for a feeling we don\u2019t want to feel is usually a good indicator that the real desire is to just disconnect from the discomfort. We all do it. There\u2019s no shame in it. All you can do is recognize it, remain aware & choose to feel it to heal it instead of bypass it.

И высыпаться - это очень важно. И сериалы тоже сами себя не посмотрят.⠀\n⠀\nНо пару месяцев назад абсолютно случайно я увидела в Инстаграме аккаунт @amapola_esp и решила, что это знак: когда как не сейчас - лучшее время мне занять себя чем-то полезным? ⠀\n⠀\nУже с первых же занятий на курсе для начинающих я поняла, что моя проблема в изучении испанского (и я, собственно, предполагала, что так и будет) заключается во...владении английским 🤦\u200D♀️⠀\n⠀\nЯ говорю и переписываюсь на английском несколько часов в день каждый день и уже много лет смотрю фильмы и сериалы только с оригинальной озвучкой. А проживание на острове так вообще было в исключительно English-speaking environment 🤷\u200D♀️ Иногда я ловлю себя на том, что даже ДУМАЮ на английском! \n⠀\nА в испанском алфавите 26 букв из 27ми выглядят так же как английские, и мне хотелось просто всёёёёё произносить и читать на английский манер 🤦\u200D♀️⠀\n⠀\nЭто был серьёзный челлендж - перестроиться на другую, непривычную манеру говорить.⠀\n⠀\nТеперь я вообще не понимаю, как некоторые люди говорят свободно на нескольких языках 😄 У меня бы просто такааая каша в голове была 😂⠀\nОгромная благодарность девочкам из @amapola_esp за чудесный курс и доступную подачу материала даже для таких чайничков как я 🙏⠀\nФормат заранее записанных видео-уроков мне очень понравился.⠀\nМаксимально удобно не быть привязанными к обучению по времени (как, например, было бы с репетитором) и делать домашние задания в любое время суток, но при этом иметь постоянную поддержку и мотивацию от куратора, которая готова разъяснить непонятные моменты.

But sometimes the air roars, tossing over patio furniture and carrying trash across the mesa. Yet even that is nothing compared to the wind's full wrath when it picks up mounds of dirt and flings it across the neighborhood like a child might kick dirt in your eye during a tantrum. The dust disperses in enormous clouds, traverses the flat land carrying debris and biting sand in its teeth casting a haze over distant mountains like a filter blinding us from the outside world. \n\nI know that personifying wind is for poets but I can't help and wonder what caused the mercurial air to create such a fuss. The wind speaks. It sings through leaves and flapping flags and tinkling chimes. It moans through mountain peaks and canyons. It whispers through pages of my notebook, through window screens and fence posts. Believing the wind is trying to tell us something is anthropocentric, of course. Obviously it exists despite us.

I\u2019ve been afraid his whole life that he\u2019ll internalize a false story that he is not good because he has a harder time learning certain things or because he operates a bit differently than other kids.

I couldn't just pack my bags and leave without putting thought to it. There was a lot of planning involved just to take this day trip a mere 150km away.\n\nI wanted to make sure that I absolutely don't come in contact with the locals there. Although I haven't shown symptoms of the disease, I could be a carrier and infect those who might not have the same infrastructure to deal with it like I do.\n\nSo here's a small list of ways to ensure you're travelling responsibly during the pandemic.\n\n-  Check your privilege. Remember that to be able to travel means you have a certain privilege that others lack and you must be responsible with it.\n\n- Choose offbeat locations where tourists\/ locals don't frequent often.\n\n- Roadtrips are the way to go. Public transport including trains, buses and flights should be avoided.\n\n- Pack your food. Don't rely on dhabas\/ restaurants for food. Pack easy to carry and eat food like fruits and sandwiches as well as some packaged snacks from your own home.\n\n- Carry as much water as possible to avoid buying from shops. We carried 6 litres of water in 4 bottles for this trip.\n\n- Ensure hygiene. If you absolutely do have to come in contact with locals, wear a mask, sanitize your hands before and after the meeting.\n\nTravel is inevitable and the coronavirus seems to be here to stay. It's important that all of us do our bit in doing everything we can to ensure the safety of those who's homes become tourist places for us.\n\nHappy travel, everybody ✌🏼 .\n\n#GoProLiveIt #GoProIn @goproindia","NumberOfLikes":344,"Hashtags":["#GoProLiveIt","#GoProIn"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Avantika | Travel Blogger 🇮🇳 in Haryana with @cntravellerindia, @travelandleisureindia, @natgeotravellerindia, @lonelyplanetmagazineindia, @globetrottinggirlsindia, @goproindia, @indiangirlstravel, @indiangirlswander, and @girlswhotravelindia.

This year, we traveled here with the tools of our (pandemic) trade: 5 string instruments and 1 violin in-progress, 2 laptops, a tripod, multiple sets of headphones and earbuds, and all the hand tools a violin maker needs to put the finishing touches on several new instruments. We didn\u2019t forget to print out the negative Covid tests.\n\nTonight, after teaching private lessons, I was on a 2.5 hour Zoom call playing cello and talking about chamber music. At the end we watched a virtual presentation of final recorded projects from the last four weeks of music-making: students, faculty, and admin all came together, almost constantly in correspondence over the past month, to make these projects happen. \n\nIt was not easy, but it was rewarding - to see the final videos, and the happy and proud faces (\u201Call the little faces in squares\u201D) on the screen. Perfection was not the goal, but collaborative music-making was achieved, in spite of the distance. \n\nMaybe now is a good time to sit back and enjoy the sunset.

It made me think in an emergency situation there may not be a trained person to hand. A lay person is often the first responder. \n\nA few months ago we wouldn't have thought twice about helping in an emergency situation. However, it is now more difficult to know what to do because COVID-19. The decision is very personal and many factors will need to be taken into consideration before making the choice to proceed. Ultimately, a person who has had a cardiac arrest is unlikely to survive if CPR is not administered promptly. \n\nThe HSE suggest the following to minimise risk & improve safety for all involved:\n\n1. Keep your hands away from your face. Wear a mask and gloves if possible. \n\n2. If a person has collapsed always check the area is safe. Look for signs of breathing and signs of life.\n\n3. Don\u2019t listen or feel for breathing by placing your ear & cheek close to the person\u2019s mouth.\n\n4. Call 112 or 999 & ask for an ambulance. If COVID-19 is suspected, tell them.\n\n5. Use an AED as soon as possible. This significantly increases the person\u2019s chances of survival. Place the AED pads on the person\u2019s chest & apply a shock, if prompted by AED. \n\n6. Perform chest compressions only. Do not give mouth to mouth rescue breaths. If there is a perceived risk of infection, you should place a cloth\/towel over the person\u2019s mouth and nose & attempt compression-only CPR & early defibrillation until help arrives.\n\nHow to give compressions:\nAdult: place the heel of your hand on the breastbone at the centre of the person's chest. Place your other hand on top of your first hand & interlock fingers.\nPosition yourself with your shoulders above your hands. Press firmly down on the chest at a depth of 5 to 6cm. Allow chest to recoil & repeat compressions at a rate of 100-120.\n\nChild: use 1 hand, same rate and depth. \nInfant: use 2 fingers in the middle of the chest but at depth of 4cm. Usually, cardiac arrest in children is caused by hypoxia. Do not delay with compressions if doubting a pulse. \n\nSo...Do you know where your nearest AED (defibrillator) is located? \nWould you feel comfortable giving CPR?\nHave you considered doing CPR or first aid course?","NumberOfLikes":186,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Bróna English in Dublin, Ireland.","NumberOfComments":35,"Timestamp":1597867406,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 19 22:03:26 CEST 2020","Location":"Dublin, Ireland"},{"CaptionText":"📢 𝘼 𝙩𝙤𝙙𝙤𝙨 𝙣𝙪𝙚𝙨𝙩𝙧𝙤𝙨 𝙥𝙖𝙘𝙞𝙚𝙣𝙩𝙚𝙨!👩\u200D⚕️\n\u2022\nPara comunicarse con nosotros, deben utilizar los medios ya mencionados.\nVía ☎️ telefónica al (787)506-4989 o a través de nuestro 📧 email oficinadramarrero@outlook.com; en el horario ⏰MARTES y JUEVES de 1-6pm y MIÉRCOLES y VIERNES de 9 am - 2pm.\n\u2022\n⚠️Recuerden todo servicio será coordinado únicamente por estos medios ☎️📧. \n\u2022\nAgradecemos su cooperación en este asunto, y pedimos disculpas por los inconvenientes que esto pudiera causar. \n\u2022\n📌 𝑫𝒆 𝒑𝒓𝒆𝒔𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒂𝒓 𝒂𝒍𝒈𝒖𝒏𝒂 𝒆𝒎𝒆𝒓𝒈𝒆𝒏𝒄𝒊𝒂 𝒑𝒖𝒆𝒅𝒆 𝒂𝒄𝒖𝒅𝒊𝒓 𝒂 𝒍𝒂 𝒔𝒂𝒍𝒂 𝒅𝒆 𝒆𝒎𝒆𝒓𝒈𝒆𝒏𝒄𝒊𝒂 𝒎á𝒔 𝒄𝒆𝒓𝒄𝒂𝒏𝒂 𝒐 𝒂 𝒍𝒂 𝒅𝒆 𝒔𝒖 𝒑𝒓𝒆𝒇𝒆𝒓𝒆𝒏𝒄𝒊𝒂.\n.\n#covid19 #pandemic2020 #socialdistancing #drafrancismarrero #generalpractitioner #orocovis #puertorico","NumberOfLikes":16,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#pandemic2020","#socialdistancing","#drafrancismarrero","#generalpractitioner","#orocovis","#puertorico"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Dra.

В частности, Дубайский международный аэропорт каждый день обслуживает более 20 тысяч пассажиров.\n⠀\nПо данным эмиратских авиаперевозчиков, они работают на 40-50% от своей обычной мощности.\n Большинство прибывающих \u2013 туристы и резиденты, которые возвращаются в страну (и вылетают из нее).

He took one of the stones from their engagement ring and placed it in a band and bought two other stones to go with it. My mom wasn\u2019t big on material things, but this band meant something to her because it showed how much my father loved her and cared for her.\n\nMy mother is from Tulsa, Oklahoma, and my dad was stationed in Tulsa during World War II. As the story goes, the barracks used to give dances or something like that. Then in comes my mom \u2014 beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. His face lit up when he saw her. \n\nWhen the war ended, my dad came back to Chicago. My grandma, his mother, owned a lot of property on the South Side. So my Dad sent for my mom and they came and lived in an apartment in my grandma\u2019s building. They bought their first home in 1955 in Englewood.\n\nMy mother was the type of woman \u2014 she didn\u2019t wait for my father to bring home the paycheck. My mother said, \u2018Wait one minute. If something happens to your dad, then what will I do? I\u2019m going to get out there and work too.\u2019 \n\nShe was a great wife. My father might have been the man of the house but my mother was the boss. And she taught my sister and I what it meant to be a woman \u2014 not just a woman, but a Black woman. To stand on your own two feet, to make your life worth something. To not depend on someone else to do for you when you can get out to do for yourself. \n\nThis is the type of mother I had.\u201D\n\nWBEZ\u2019s @nueli photographed Josette Merill, whose mother, Lillie Merrill, died of COVID-19 in April at the age of 98.

Anyone who sees me these days will notice the difference (thanks to the Pilates) 🧘\u200D♀️. \n🌟I got the chance to spend much much more time with hubby and strengthen our family unit. Believe me this time is so precious 👨\u200D👩\u200D👦. \n🌟And last but not least, I learned to wake up every morning and say Thank You for everything I have in life.

The trials of Covishield vaccine will involve 1,600 people above the age of 18 years across 17 locations in Pune, Mumbai and Ahmedabad. Out of the 1600 test subjects, 400 will be tested for immune response whereas 1200 will be tested to understand the safety of the vaccine. This is by far the largest COVID-19 vaccine trial in the country. \n\nReports also indicate that in Mumbai, the trials are being conducted at KEM and Nair hospitals. They have already started the preliminary procedures for the study. The medical institution will be conducting trials on 320 volunteers between the age group of 20 and 50 years. In total, the trial has around 1000 to 1,100 participants enrolled across five to eight locations. \n\nThe vaccine has already undergone Phase I and II trials in the UK where it showed positive results. Preliminary trials revealed that the vaccine induces an antibody response in just 28 days -- similar to the patients who have recovered from COVID-19. A second booster shot of the vaccine spikes antibody response at an even higher level. All the blood samples of patients with a second booster shot revealed neutralising activity. \n\n📸REUTERS\n#oxford #oxfordvaccine #seruminstituteofindia #vaccinecoronadanger #oxfordvaccineprice #seruminstitute #vaccine #instagood #instadaily #instagram #pandemic2020 #akhiltalks #AkhilTalks #reuters #recent4recent #recentupdates","NumberOfLikes":55,"Hashtags":["#oxford","#oxfordvaccine","#seruminstituteofindia","#vaccinecoronadanger","#oxfordvaccineprice","#seruminstitute","#vaccine","#instagood","#instadaily","#instagram","#pandemic2020","#akhiltalks","#AkhilTalks","#reuters","#recent4recent","#recentupdates"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Akhil Talks on August 19, 2020.
