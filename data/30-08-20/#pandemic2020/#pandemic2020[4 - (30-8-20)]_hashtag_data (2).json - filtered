Oak Grove Park was selected and approval was given to install the world\u2019s first Disc Golf Course. In 1975, \u201CSteady\u201D Ed installed the first official disc golf course at¬†Oak Grove Park¬†in Pasadena, Los Angeles County, California, with the targets being nothing more than permanent poles placed into the ground. As you can imagine, this brought about many disagreements, so a new way of catching the disc resulted. In 1976 Ed replaced the poles with the first DGA Disc Pole Hole, that were the first disc golf targets to use chains to stop a disc. Which later on became one of many patented disc encatchment devices.

I haven\u2019t been consistent because somebody or some animal is usually in need of ALL OF my time. \nI had to make a sacrifice somewhere because I crave working out.

There is more to me that touches uncomfortably and gets in the way of other things. My body wants to run, wants to move. Wants to feel exerted. \nFarm work and riding and a leisurely bike ride aren\u2019t enough for me, I need that strenuous physical activity. \n\nSo last night instead of cooking a meal from scratch, I let the kids have Mr Noodles. And it\u2019s totally ok. ONCE IN AWHILE. \nEven with that, I didn\u2019t have time to change into workout clothes, put a bra on, warm up or cool down.

The bench, headed by Justice Sanjay K Kaul, took a grim view of such unsubstantiated claims and the very filing of such a PIL in the apex court.\n\nIt was of the view that the direction sought in Gyantara's PIL were completely misconceived and that it was time to send a message that people should not approach a court with such contentions.\n\nThe bench, which also had Justices Ajay Rastogi and Aniruddha Bose, further noted that the primary consideration of the petitioner in filing such a petition seemed to be getting some attention and publicity.\n\n\"We are of the view that such kind of petitions must be stopped as anybody and everybody thinks they have some cure for the situation,\" it maintained.\n\nThe court, in its order on Thursday, added that such petitioners seek to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution, possibly only to gain some publicity.\n\n\"Such wastage of judicial time is completely inappropriate,\" held the bench. It then dismissed the writ petition with cost of Rs 10,000 to be deposited by Gyantara with the Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Welfare Fund within four weeks.\nSource @cnnnews18 \n#medical #aayurveda #aayurvedic #medicine #supremcourtofindia #fine #legaleducation #legalsaurav #thehindu #thewire #covƒ±d19 #coronavirus #homelife #pandemic2020 #amarujala #doctor #consitution #fakeclaim #aayushmantralay #writs #lawyers #advocate #delhiblogger #haryana #haryanameme #beaware #stayupdated #legal #legalupdates #mumbai","NumberOfLikes":173,"Hashtags":["#medical","#aayurveda","#aayurvedic","#medicine","#supremcourtofindia","#fine","#legaleducation","#legalsaurav","#thehindu","#thewire","#covƒ±d19","#coronavirus","#homelife","#pandemic2020","#amarujala","#doctor","#consitution","#fakeclaim","#aayushmantralay","#writs","#lawyers","#advocate","#delhiblogger","#haryana","#haryanameme","#beaware","#stayupdated","#legal","#legalupdates","#mumbai"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Legal Saurav (üéØ 10K) in Haryana.

The shadows in our lives remind us of the things we must leave behind and the things we must pursue.\n\nSometimes even in the face of immense calamity, there is hardly any change. Just awe, fear, palpitation and a gradual return to the status quo. This could lead to procrastination and postponement of future good.\n\nThe pandemic is really a shadow of our time on earth. A force for change.\n\n#archetypes \n#womenwhorunwiththewolves \n#darkman \n#yakshi\n#shadow \n#fearintofuel \n#nightmare \n#pandemic \n#pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":19,"Hashtags":["#archetypes","#womenwhorunwiththewolves","#darkman","#yakshi","#shadow","#fearintofuel","#nightmare","#pandemic","#pandemic2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Neelima Vinod on August 21, 2020.","NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1598002424,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 11:33:44 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"This crazy ride got me hanging on like... üò∑ ü§™ü§Øüò≤üòï #coronacoasterüé¢ \n\n.\n\n#friday #fridayfeels #2020 #2020challenge #pandemic2020 #pandemic #pandemiclife #quarantinelife #quarantine #isolation #lockdown #workfromhome #mask #masks #thenewnormal #pivot #coronacoaster #coronavirus #covid19","NumberOfLikes":4,"Hashtags":["#coronacoasterüé¢","#friday","#fridayfeels","#2020","#2020challenge","#pandemic2020","#pandemic","#pandemiclife","#quarantinelife","#quarantine","#isolation","#lockdown","#workfromhome","#mask","#masks","#thenewnormal","#pivot","#coronacoaster","#coronavirus","#covid19"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Marie Rocher in South Africa.

And that makes it even more important to focus on gratitude instead. \n.\nIt is easy to concentrate on your silver linings. Just take a few moments every day to reflect on all that you have. All the things that are going well and all the reasons that make you smile every day.\n.\nFocus on all your blessings - a loving family to spend the lockdown with, a roof over your head to stay in with them, the food on your table when the world is facing a huge economic crisis and most importantly, your health and the hope in your heart that keeps you going. \n.\nJust being mindful of all that you have will make you appreciate your life and help you stay positive through and beyond this pandemic.

The no-alarm mornings. Those days when we didn\u2019t have to hit the snooze or the off button and slept for as long as we liked.\n\n2. When shows on Netflix and Prime were mostly binged on during the day while the late night hours were exclusively allocated to video calls, chats, and Ludo King.\n\n3. Those morning or evening walks which didn\u2019t need a workout playlist. The silence from having less people on the road, the birds chirping, the leaves rustling, became all the music we would ever need. \n\n4. Movie Sessions with the whole family when Mom would see the rating of the movie on Netflix and immediately say, \u201CThat movie has s... search for another one.\u201D No amount of whining and the assurance to forward \u2018those\u2019 scenes would change her mind. \n\n5. When everyone at home took turns to beat the brains out of coffee, sugar, and water for the perfect Dalgona coffee. \n\n6. The way we flaunted our cooking skills when we \u2018managed\u2019 to make Dosa. Or chappathi? And we hated all those who replied with a photo and an annoying caption- \u201CChicken Pot Biryani: made by me.\u201D\n\n7. When most of us finally got the time to pick up that pen and write down that poem, or to pick up that guitar and sing that song, pick up that book and finish reading it, or just pick up nothing and enjoy being ourselves. Like I said, finally!\n\n8. The clear starry sky which freed itself from volumes of pollution and became the best piece of art to be created. \n\n9. The phone calls we could make after years, the conversations we could complete, the people to whom we could tell how much we love them after much procrastination.\n\n10. The friendships we found in unexpected places, in unexpected people and in unexpected ways which we strongly hope would remain with us forever.\n@sharylss \n.‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nPC: @noone.su \nSHARE YOUR FAVOURITE LOCKDOWN MEMORIES IN THE COMMENTS SECTION. \n.\n#writersofinstagram #writingcommunity #writing #writings #write #writer #writerscommunity #writersofig #writeaway #writersblock #writersnetwork #writeaway #writerssociety #writersuniverse #writersporn #lockdown2020 #lockdown #lockdownlife #covid19 #covid_19 #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife","NumberOfLikes":35,"Hashtags":["#writersofinstagram","#writingcommunity","#writing","#writings","#write","#writer","#writerscommunity","#writersofig","#writeaway","#writersblock","#writersnetwork","#writeaway","#writerssociety","#writersuniverse","#writersporn","#lockdown2020","#lockdown","#lockdownlife","#covid19","#covid_19","#pandemic2020","#pandemiclife"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Sharyl Sodadasi in Listicle.

I have felt the uncertainty of having no routine or schedule. I experienced loneliness without my family and close friends but also relief in times of solitude. I've felt stressed trying to manage the demands of my work with that of John's (extra busy) work and the boys' needs. And stressed when work came to a standing hault. I hardly ever felt at peace and almost always felt like I was failing as a mother, wife, friend and business owner. \u2063\n\u2063\nSomehow, something switched inside of me this week and my brain finally figured it out. I'm able to prioritize my needs both emotionally and physically and have found solice in how, and with who, I spend my time with. \u2063\n\u2063\nOf course, as I'm finally figuring this all out, I'm faced with a new reality of back to school and all of the unknowns associated with that. It's on the horizon and in the back of my mind, but for now I'm going to try and focus on the NOW and relish these special times with my kids. \u2063\n\u2063\nDespite the craziness of having them home with me 24\/7 for 4+ months and the (extra) yelling, I'm really enjoying this extra time I have with them. \u2063\n\u2063\n\/\/ ùêáùêöùêØùêû ùêà ùê•ùê®ùê¨ùê≠ ùê¢ùê≠? ùêéùê´ ùê¢ùê¨ ùêöùêßùê≤ùê®ùêßùêû ùêûùê•ùê¨ùêû ùêüùêûùêûùê•ùê¢ùêßùê† ùê≠ùê°ùê¢ùê¨ ùê≠ùê®ùê®?","NumberOfLikes":224,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Maya Fitzpatrick in Algonquin Logging Museum.

Most people infected will experience a mild to moderate respiratory illness, whilst others will show no symptoms at all.

This series is written, shot in lockdown, so you can clearly see there's no combined scenes of characters & thanks to razor sharp editing to make things very crispy.

A good story can be narrate very easily with the help of excellent team & big courage.

I\u2019ve always wanted bangs, but never wanted to commit to the work required to style\u2019em every day. I\u2019m more of a wash & go kinda a girl to my mom\u2019s dismay! Even my stylists have dissuaded me in the past...well, I didn\u2019t even own a blow dryer so they had a point! ü§™ \n\nBut with much of the industry shut down due to covid, why not make lemonade? Or lemon bars! I get to change my \u2018do & not stress too much about looking exactly like my haircut for a change! I had to get the same \u2018pretty girl\u2019 haircut (read: long layers) as one of my stylists dubbed it for most of my career. I\u2019m still committed to the craft but I\u2019m also recommitting to myself. A chance to explore all the little things I\u2019ve wanted to do but put off due to pragmatism.\n\nGrowing up with a lot of emphasis on my appearance, I always felt a resistance to doing anything but the bare minimum to keep it up. But that\u2019s punishing myself for the way others chose to construct my identity\/value me, right? Taking that extra time to style my bangs has given me the opportunity to give myself that extra care that I always felt guilty\/weird for doing. How odd, that such small things can become big things.\n\nre: coping mechanisms...we all have them to a certain degree. Any time we replace an action\/object\/person for a feeling we don\u2019t want to feel is usually a good indicator that the real desire is to just disconnect from the discomfort. We all do it. There\u2019s no shame in it. All you can do is recognize it, remain aware & choose to feel it to heal it instead of bypass it. Or bangs...there are always bangs (well, unless you\u2019ve always wanted them like me üòÇ)!\n\nTY, @the_real_lin_shady for your inspiring #youtubevideo \n\n.\n.\n.\n\n#imnotyellingyoureyelling #loudnoises #diybangs #hierachyofneeds #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife #pandemicproblems #Bardotbangs #wavyhair #wavybangs #brigittebardot #matildadjerf #brigettebardot #curtainbangs #covidhair #copingmechanism #feeltoheal #healyourself #awareness #lemonadeseason #sexkittenhair #frenchsexkitten #sexkitten","NumberOfLikes":87,"Hashtags":["#youtubevideo","#imnotyellingyoureyelling","#loudnoises","#diybangs","#hierachyofneeds","#pandemic2020","#pandemiclife","#pandemicproblems","#Bardotbangs","#wavyhair","#wavybangs","#brigittebardot","#matildadjerf","#brigettebardot","#curtainbangs","#covidhair","#copingmechanism","#feeltoheal","#healyourself","#awareness","#lemonadeseason","#sexkittenhair","#frenchsexkitten","#sexkitten"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":17,"Timestamp":1597950753,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 20 21:12:33 CEST 2020","Location":"Los Angeles, California"},{"CaptionText":"Another one!

But sometimes the air roars, tossing over patio furniture and carrying trash across the mesa. Yet even that is nothing compared to the wind's full wrath when it picks up mounds of dirt and flings it across the neighborhood like a child might kick dirt in your eye during a tantrum. The dust disperses in enormous clouds, traverses the flat land carrying debris and biting sand in its teeth casting a haze over distant mountains like a filter blinding us from the outside world.¬†\n\nI know that personifying wind is for poets but I can't help and wonder what caused the mercurial air to create such a fuss. The wind speaks. It sings through leaves and flapping flags and tinkling chimes. It moans through mountain peaks and canyons. It whispers through pages of my notebook, through window screens and fence posts. Believing the wind is trying to tell us something is anthropocentric, of course. Obviously it exists despite us. But, still, I wonder, what does it say?

I told him I kept at it and eventually it got less hard.

I\u2019ve been afraid his whole life that he\u2019ll internalize a false story that he is not good because he has a harder time learning certain things or because he operates a bit differently than other kids. The stories we tell ourselves are important, and I don\u2019t want my son stuck inside the lie that he\u2019s not good at something just because he\u2019s not being given the help he needs.\u201D\n.\n#iep #distancelearning #pandemic2020 #pandemicparenting @romper","NumberOfLikes":67,"Hashtags":["#iep","#distancelearning","#pandemic2020","#pandemicparenting"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Minna Dubin on August 20, 2020.

I couldn't just pack my bags and leave without putting thought to it. There was a lot of planning involved just to take this day trip a mere 150km away.\n\nI wanted to make sure that I absolutely don't come in contact with the locals there. Although I haven't shown symptoms of the disease, I could be a carrier and infect those who might not have the same infrastructure to deal with it like I do.\n\nSo here's a small list of ways to ensure you're travelling responsibly during the pandemic.\n\n-  Check your privilege. Remember that to be able to travel means you have a certain privilege that others lack and you must be responsible with it.\n\n- Choose offbeat locations where tourists\/ locals don't frequent often.\n\n- Roadtrips are the way to go. Public transport including trains, buses and flights should be avoided.\n\n- Pack your food. Don't rely on dhabas\/ restaurants for food. Pack easy to carry and eat food like fruits and sandwiches as well as some packaged snacks from your own home.\n\n- Carry as much water as possible to avoid buying from shops. We carried 6 litres of water in 4 bottles for this trip.\n\n- Ensure hygiene. If you absolutely do have to come in contact with locals, wear a mask, sanitize your hands before and after the meeting.\n\nTravel is inevitable and the coronavirus seems to be here to stay. It's important that all of us do our bit in doing everything we can to ensure the safety of those who's homes become tourist places for us.\n\nHappy travel, everybody ‚úåüèº .\n\n#GoProLiveIt #GoProIn @goproindia","NumberOfLikes":344,"Hashtags":["#GoProLiveIt","#GoProIn"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Avantika | Travel Blogger üáÆüá≥ in Haryana with @cntravellerindia, @travelandleisureindia, @natgeotravellerindia, @lonelyplanetmagazineindia, @globetrottinggirlsindia, @goproindia, @indiangirlstravel, @indiangirlswander, and @girlswhotravelindia.

It appears though that Kamath has not blamed anyone in his suicide note, sources said.\n\nKamath was found dead in the bathtub. It was said that the artist was under stress since a long period of time and the coronavirus lockdown made it worse for him.\n\nKamath lived with his mother in his Mumbai apartment. He was a photographer as well apart from an artist. In fact, his glasswork paintings were popular in the Mumbai art circuit.

The first few times we came to this place, it was to rehearse and play live chamber music concerts. This year, we traveled here with the tools of our (pandemic) trade: 5 string instruments and 1 violin in-progress, 2 laptops, a tripod, multiple sets of headphones and earbuds, and all the hand tools a violin maker needs to put the finishing touches on several new instruments. We didn\u2019t forget to print out the negative Covid tests.\n\nTonight, after teaching private lessons, I was on a 2.5 hour Zoom call playing cello and talking about chamber music. At the end we watched a virtual presentation of final recorded projects from the last four weeks of music-making: students, faculty, and admin all came together, almost constantly in correspondence over the past month, to make these projects happen. \n\nIt was not easy, but it was rewarding - to see the final videos, and the happy and proud faces (\u201Call the little faces in squares\u201D) on the screen. Perfection was not the goal, but collaborative music-making was achieved, in spite of the distance. \n\nMaybe now is a good time to sit back and enjoy the sunset.

It made me think in an emergency situation there may not be a trained person to hand. A lay person is often the first responder. \n\nA few months ago we wouldn't have thought twice about helping in an emergency situation. However, it is now more difficult to know what to do because COVID-19. The decision is very personal and many factors will need to be taken into consideration before making the choice to proceed. Ultimately, a person who has had a cardiac arrest is unlikely to survive if CPR is not administered promptly. \n\nThe HSE suggest the following to minimise risk & improve safety for all involved:\n\n1. Keep your hands away from your face. Wear a mask and gloves if possible. \n\n2. If a person has collapsed always check the area is safe. Look for signs of breathing and signs of life.\n\n3. Don\u2019t listen or feel for breathing by placing your ear & cheek close to the person\u2019s mouth.\n\n4. Call 112 or 999 & ask for an ambulance. If COVID-19 is suspected, tell them.\n\n5. Use an AED as soon as possible. This significantly increases the person\u2019s chances of survival. Place the AED pads on the person\u2019s chest & apply a shock, if prompted by AED. \n\n6. Perform chest compressions only. Do not give mouth to mouth rescue breaths. If there is a perceived risk of infection, you should place a cloth\/towel over the person\u2019s mouth and nose & attempt compression-only CPR & early defibrillation until help arrives.\n\nHow to give compressions:\nAdult: place the heel of your hand on the breastbone at the centre of the person's chest. Place your other hand on top of your first hand & interlock fingers.\nPosition yourself with your shoulders above your hands. Press firmly down on the chest at a depth of 5 to 6cm. Allow chest to recoil & repeat compressions at a rate of 100-120.\n\nChild: use 1 hand, same rate and depth. \nInfant: use 2 fingers in the middle of the chest but at depth of 4cm. Usually, cardiac arrest in children is caused by hypoxia. Do not delay with compressions if doubting a pulse. \n\nSo...Do you know where your nearest AED (defibrillator) is located? \nWould you feel comfortable giving CPR?\nHave you considered doing CPR or first aid course?","NumberOfLikes":186,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Br√≥na English in Dublin, Ireland.","NumberOfComments":35,"Timestamp":1597867406,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 19 22:03:26 CEST 2020","Location":"Dublin, Ireland"},{"CaptionText":"üì¢ ùòº ùô©ùô§ùôôùô§ùô® ùô£ùô™ùôöùô®ùô©ùôßùô§ùô® ùô•ùôñùôòùôûùôöùô£ùô©ùôöùô®!üë©\u200D‚öïÔ∏è\n\u2022\nPara comunicarse con nosotros, deben utilizar los medios ya mencionados.\nViÃÅa ‚òéÔ∏è telefoÃÅnica al (787)506-4989 o a traveÃÅs de nuestro üìß email oficinadramarrero@outlook.com; en el horario ‚è∞MARTES y JUEVES de 1-6pm y MIEÃÅRCOLES y VIERNES de 9 am - 2pm.\n\u2022\n‚ö†Ô∏èRecuerden todo servicio seraÃÅ coordinado uÃÅnicamente por estos medios ‚òéÔ∏èüìß. \n\u2022\nAgradecemos su cooperacioÃÅn en este asunto, y pedimos disculpas por los inconvenientes que esto pudiera causar. \n\u2022\nüìå ùë´ùíÜ ùíëùíìùíÜùíîùíÜùíèùíïùíÇùíì ùíÇùíçùíàùíñùíèùíÇ ùíÜùíéùíÜùíìùíàùíÜùíèùíÑùíäùíÇ ùíëùíñùíÜùíÖùíÜ ùíÇùíÑùíñùíÖùíäùíì ùíÇ ùíçùíÇ ùíîùíÇùíçùíÇ ùíÖùíÜ ùíÜùíéùíÜùíìùíàùíÜùíèùíÑùíäùíÇ ùíé√°ùíî ùíÑùíÜùíìùíÑùíÇùíèùíÇ ùíê ùíÇ ùíçùíÇ ùíÖùíÜ ùíîùíñ ùíëùíìùíÜùíáùíÜùíìùíÜùíèùíÑùíäùíÇ.\n.\n#covid19 #pandemic2020 #socialdistancing #drafrancismarrero #generalpractitioner #orocovis #puertorico","NumberOfLikes":16,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#pandemic2020","#socialdistancing","#drafrancismarrero","#generalpractitioner","#orocovis","#puertorico"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Dra.

He took one of the stones from their engagement ring and placed it in a band and bought two other stones to go with it. My mom wasn\u2019t big on material things, but this band meant something to her because it showed how much my father loved her and cared for her.\n\nMy mother is from Tulsa, Oklahoma, and my dad was stationed in Tulsa during World War II. As the story goes, the barracks used to give dances or something like that. Then in comes my mom \u2014 beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. His face lit up when he saw her.¬†\n\nWhen the war ended, my dad came back to Chicago. My grandma, his mother, owned a lot of property on the South Side. So my Dad sent for my mom and they came and lived in an apartment in my grandma\u2019s building. They bought their first home in 1955 in Englewood.\n\nMy mother was the type of woman \u2014 she didn\u2019t wait for my father to bring home the paycheck. My mother said, \u2018Wait one minute. If something happens to your dad, then what will I do? I\u2019m going to get out there and work too.\u2019¬†\n\nShe was a great wife. My father might have been the man of the house but my mother was the boss. And she taught my sister and I what it meant to be a woman \u2014 not just a woman, but a Black woman. To stand on your own two feet, to make your life worth something. To not depend on someone else to do for you when you can get out to do for yourself.¬†\n\nThis is the type of mother I had.\u201D\n\nWBEZ\u2019s @nueli photographed Josette Merill, whose mother, Lillie Merrill, died of COVID-19 in April at the age of 98.

The trials of Covishield vaccine will involve 1,600 people above the age of 18 years across 17 locations in Pune, Mumbai and Ahmedabad. Out of the 1600 test subjects, 400 will be tested for immune response whereas 1200 will be tested to understand the safety of the vaccine. This is by far the largest COVID-19 vaccine trial in the country. \n\nReports also indicate that in Mumbai, the trials are being conducted at KEM and Nair hospitals. They have already started the preliminary procedures for the study. The medical institution will be conducting trials on 320 volunteers between the age group of 20 and 50 years. In total, the trial has around 1000 to 1,100 participants enrolled across five to eight locations. \n\nThe vaccine has already undergone Phase I and II trials in the UK where it showed positive results. Preliminary trials revealed that the vaccine induces an antibody response in just 28 days -- similar to the patients who have recovered from COVID-19. A second booster shot of the vaccine spikes antibody response at an even higher level.

But we really only leave the house for essentials, so there's no need to make it a family event. \n\nWell today we were shopping for a school backpack, so I decided to take him in so he could pick one that he loves. It was so weird taking him in Walmart and having to explain to him that he has to leave his mask on the whole time we are inside. He did good tho! Not once did he complain about his face being covered or try to take it off.\n\nStill so crazy that this is the \"norm\" now.","NumberOfLikes":30,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Yvette Campos üôà in Cocoa, Florida with @the_raven_sage.
