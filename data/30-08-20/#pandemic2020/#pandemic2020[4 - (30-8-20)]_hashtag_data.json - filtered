I haven\u2019t been consistent because somebody or some animal is usually in need of ALL OF my time. \nI had to make a sacrifice somewhere because I crave working out.

There is more to me that touches uncomfortably and gets in the way of other things. My body wants to run, wants to move. Wants to feel exerted. \nFarm work and riding and a leisurely bike ride aren\u2019t enough for me, I need that strenuous physical activity. \n\nSo last night instead of cooking a meal from scratch, I let the kids have Mr Noodles. And it\u2019s totally ok. ONCE IN AWHILE. \nEven with that, I didn\u2019t have time to change into workout clothes, put a bra on, warm up or cool down.

In a pandemic, to survive tough businesses you need razor-sharp thinking. A must-read book for CEOs, entrepreneurs and start-up founders on how to deal with uncertainty. Author Ozan Varol @ozanvarol who served the 2003 Mars Exploration Rovers project, talks about how, \"We're hesitant to think big, reluctant to dance with uncertainty and afraid of failure. These are the bugs.\"\nHere are 7 Secrets of How to Think Like a Rocket Scientist:\nRule 1: Make Doubt your Superpower. Every genius hesitates. We should be fueled not by a desire for a quick catharsis but by intrigue. Where certainty ends, progress begins. Einstein tangoed with uncertainty, conducted imaginative thought experiments and asked questions nobody dared.\nRule 2: Embrace the sense of possibilities, push your limits, explore what is possible.\nRule 3: Question your assumptions. Why you do the things you do. Don't do things that everyone does.\nRule 4: Don't be stuck in systems. They solve problems that don't even exist today.\nRule 5: Create Moonshot goals. Our goals are often safe and cushioned because we fear failure. We have been seduced to thinking flying lower is safer than flying higher.\nRule 6: You must be willing to share your unique ideas with the world, don't be repressed by conformity.\nRule 7: Don't Rulebound Yourself. Ozan writes, \"Research shows we become increasingly rulebound as we grow older. Events begin to rhyme. Days begin to repeat. We repeat the same overworn soundbites, stick to the same job, talk to the same people, watch the same shows. It's choose-your-own-adventure book that always has same ending. Our processes are developed in response to yesterday's troubles, if you don't question it  will impede forward movement.\"\n.\nThink Like A Rocket Scientist is published by Penguin Random House\n#books #book #pandemic #2020 #bookstagram #bookstagrammer #booklover #bookaddict #booknerd #bookreview #booksofinstagram #bookworm #bookgram #booklovers #selfhelp #rules #life #work #think #mind #instamood #insta #newnormal #pandemic2020 #instagood","NumberOfLikes":10,"Hashtags":["#1","#books","#book","#pandemic","#2020","#bookstagram","#bookstagrammer","#booklover","#bookaddict","#booknerd","#bookreview","#booksofinstagram","#bookworm","#bookgram","#booklovers","#selfhelp","#rules","#life","#work","#think","#mind","#instamood","#insta","#newnormal","#pandemic2020","#instagood"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Nona Walia on August 20, 2020 tagging @penguinrandomhouse.

The estimate includes parents who have already left the workforce as well as those who are at risk of losing their jobs...\n\nSo-called shadow joblessness, defined as Americans who have stopped looking for work, spiked to 8 million at the peak of the pandemic, and remains 5 million above pre-crisis levels, according to Bloomberg Economics. School closures will continue to impact this number, especially the labor force participation rate for women, who generally take on a greater share of childcare obligations.\n\nBUT HERE IS WHAT YOU CAN DO\n\nIn order to stay afloat in these difficult times you have to be creative and passionate about generating extra income for you and your family...\n\nBelow we have a few resources and ideas that other parents and spouses are discovering and using to generate extra income from home during the pandemic...\n\nREFERRAL MARKETING\nThis is where companies pay you for referring client who signs up for their services...\n\nThe catch...you must sign up too, but its free!!!\n\nHere are our TOP 2.. \n\n1.

Le gusto ver lo grande que son y ver a las abejas en ellos. Ella escogió uno de los dos que trajimos a casa. Después de escoger nuestro girasol y regresar a la entrada en el vagón, fuimos a que viera a los a animales, tenían unos burros a los cuales no pensó dos veces en ir a agárralos. Y para nuestra fortuna no vio los juegos que estaban del otro lado, por que a la fecha las area de juego aún están prohibidos. Al regresar a casa la subí a que durmiera su siesta, en lo que se durmió hice una sopa rápido y comencé a preparar lo que necesitaba más tarde para una demostración.

I have felt the uncertainty of having no routine or schedule. I experienced loneliness without my family and close friends but also relief in times of solitude. I've felt stressed trying to manage the demands of my work with that of John's (extra busy) work and the boys' needs. And stressed when work came to a standing hault. I hardly ever felt at peace and almost always felt like I was failing as a mother, wife, friend and business owner. \u2063\n\u2063\nSomehow, something switched inside of me this week and my brain finally figured it out. I'm able to prioritize my needs both emotionally and physically and have found solice in how, and with who, I spend my time with. \u2063\n\u2063\nOf course, as I'm finally figuring this all out, I'm faced with a new reality of back to school and all of the unknowns associated with that. It's on the horizon and in the back of my mind, but for now I'm going to try and focus on the NOW and relish these special times with my kids. \u2063\n\u2063\nDespite the craziness of having them home with me 24\/7 for 4+ months and the (extra) yelling, I'm really enjoying this extra time I have with them. \u2063\n\u2063\n\/\/ 𝐇𝐚𝐯𝐞 𝐈 𝐥𝐨𝐬𝐭 𝐢𝐭?

Writing was captivating & writers have used the lockdown period & it's effects at its best. Whole premises set around COVID 19 doesn't look like a gimmick at all.

This series is written, shot in lockdown, so you can clearly see there's no combined scenes of characters & thanks to razor sharp editing to make things very crispy. Show direction in online investigation scenes was clap worthy. In this show you can easily see that social media & internet can do anything. The use of social media has its own different merits & demerits. Events are neat & nothing looks unreal at all.\n\n@battatawada I'm speechless. I have reviewed your every show & film.

I try to avoid it, just like arguing. So much so that there\u2019s many of times even if a person deserves for me to yell at them I won\u2019t. There was a point in time I enjoyed yelling, it\u2019s also when I had no problem lying. I don\u2019t like yelling at cops because no matter what something\u2019s wrong when someone is doing that. However I also don\u2019t  like to be accused of lying like that and yelling at that cop felt really good. A day later I am shocked at how ready to die I often am but also extremely proud of myself. That cop was bullying me, causing me harm and while I have handled other situations different and would likely, that\u2019s exactly what I should of done. Maybe it was the being born premature, maybe that\u2019s I\u2019ve always generally felt at peace with \u201Cgod\u201D or death, with both it could be said I dint seek it but  generally not afraid of it. This of course is only in the moment at times as just a couple of months ago I cried in the hospital after being diagnosed with heart failure, although I cried more about having to live with all you fuck ups than death.

Meski pada praktiknya tetap saja tidak dapat dilakukan sesuai harapan. Warga masih butuh keluar dari rumah untuk melakukan rutinitasnya. Apalagi rutinitas yang menyangkut perekonomian rumah tangga, sulit sekali untuk dihentikan dan dialihkan pada hal lain. Tidak semua profesi dapat melakukan sistem WFH (Work From Home), sehingga menimbulkan kecemasan dan ketakutan pada kalangan tertentu.\n\nBukan hanya mengancam kesehatan fisik, Covid-19 juga serius mengancam kesehatan mental. Sebagai profesi yang menerapkan sistem WFH, guru yang harus melakukan pembelajaran daring tidak terkecuali mendapat ancaman stress yang cukup besar. Tuntutan yang banyak, sistem-sistem baru, dan media pembelajaran yang masih asing menuntut untuk dipelajari dalam waktu yang singkat, membuat guru kelelahan bukan hanya dalam hal fisik, tetapi juga psikis. Beban mengajar menjadi dua kali lipat karena membutuhkan kreativitas dan keterampilan-keterampilan baru.\n\nBukan hanya siswa yang kesulitan beradaptasi dengan sistem pendidikan baru ini, terlebih guru yang harus mempersiapkan dan mempelajari banyak hal secara tiba-tiba. Dibutuhkan perjuangan dan mental yang sehat untuk terus menjalani sistem baru ini.\n\n#kesehatanmental #mentalguru #kesehatanjiwa #kesejahteraanguru #guruindonesia #indonesiamengajar #gurumengajar #gurupengajar #pembelajaranonline #pandemic2020 #semangatguru #semangatpendidik #pendidikindonesia #guruagenperubahanindonesia #menjagakesehatan #menjagakesehatantubuh #pendidikanindonesialebihbaik #pendidikanindonesia","NumberOfLikes":32,"Hashtags":["#kesehatanmental","#mentalguru","#kesehatanjiwa","#kesejahteraanguru","#guruindonesia","#indonesiamengajar","#gurumengajar","#gurupengajar","#pembelajaranonline","#pandemic2020","#semangatguru","#semangatpendidik","#pendidikindonesia","#guruagenperubahanindonesia","#menjagakesehatan","#menjagakesehatantubuh","#pendidikanindonesialebihbaik","#pendidikanindonesia"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597925615,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 20 14:13:35 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"adizzle_c","CaptionText":"About once a month I make an appearance in actual work clothes 🖇️🚦🛣️🚲🚶\u200D♀️\n\n#essential #workworkwork #transportationplanner #urbanplanner #pandemic2020 #officeappearance","NumberOfLikes":44,"Hashtags":["#essential","#workworkwork","#transportationplanner","#urbanplanner","#pandemic2020","#officeappearance"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Amanda C. in Tampa, Florida.

So don\u2019t put your #investment decisions and financial planning on hold just to wait for the situation to become normal.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has brought the world to a standstill. Probably, this is one of the biggest crises in the last 75 years. However, the pandemic is temporary and most of us are going to sail through this tough time. Moreover, experiencing such a difficult time makes us better prepared for the future. This pandemic encourages us to revisit our #financial needs and help us to reevaluate our #financialplans.\n\n𝐈𝐧𝐜𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐞 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐫𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲 𝐟𝐮𝐧𝐝\n\nHaving an emergency fund equivalent to six months of expenditure may not be enough anymore. A crisis like this can keep people out of the job #market for a very long time and also bring unexpected large medical expenditures. We should be prepared for the worst and make the necessary arrangements to make sure we get to live our normal life.\n\nHaving an emergency fund of at least two years of expenditure could give us adequate protection to fight any future unforeseen circumstances. Individuals should keep emergency funds in low-risk and liquid fixed-income #assets.\n\n𝐑𝐞𝐜𝐚𝐥𝐜𝐮𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐢𝐧𝐬𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐧𝐞𝐞𝐝𝐬\n\nA good health #insurance plan is a must for all. If it\u2019s family insurance then coverage definitely needs to be higher than Rs 5 lakh. Investors should consider having low-cost top-up insurance to increase the coverage amount. Further, adequate term insurance for the main earning member of the family is necessary.\n\n𝐑𝐞𝐯𝐢𝐬𝐢𝐭 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐟𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐠𝐨𝐚𝐥𝐬\n\nTraveling and large social gatherings are two things that are stopped due to this crisis. Many individuals keep vacation as one of their major financial #goals.\n.\n.\nRead the entire article on our Facebook page >>LINK IN BIO<<\n.\n.\n#finance #financial #financialcrisis #pandemic2020 #pandemic #coronavirus #covid19 #coronaviruscrisis #investment #healthfund #funds #insurance #insurancepolicy","NumberOfLikes":0,"Hashtags":["#pandemic,","#crisis","#investment","#financial","#financialplans.","#market","#assets.","#insurance","#goals.","#finance","#financial","#financialcrisis","#pandemic2020","#pandemic","#coronavirus","#covid19","#coronaviruscrisis","#investment","#healthfund","#funds","#insurance","#insurancepolicy"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Entrepreneurs Institute on August 20, 2020.

SPEND MORE TIME OUTSIDE AND CONNECTING WITH MOTHER NATURE. \n 🌲 🦢 🌳 🚶\u200D♀️ ⛅️ \n\n\u201CBeing in nature, or even viewing scenes of nature, reduces anger, fear, and stress and increases pleasant feelings. Exposure to nature not only makes you feel better emotionally, it contributes to your physical wellbeing, reducing blood pressure, heart rate, muscle tension, and the production of stress hormones.\u201D\n\n2. KNOW...THIS CANNOT AND WILL NOT LAST FOREVER. 🛑 ✋ \n\nNothing lasts forever. \n\nGood guys n gals always win 🦸\u200D♂️ 🦸\u200D♀️ \n\n3. BE KIND TO ONE ANOTHER! ❤️💝 ❤️ \n\nWe\u2019re all in this together & the world needs a lot more love, especially now. \n\nBe the change you wish to see in the world.\n\nAlso, \u201CWhen we help others and do kind acts, it causes our brain to release endorphins, the chemicals that give us feelings of fervor and high spirits - similar to a \"runner's high.\" Doing something nice for someone also gives the brain a serotonin boost, the chemical that gives us that feeling of satisfaction and well-being.\u201D\n\n4. TAKE A BREAK FROM SOCIAL MEDIA & THE NEWS. 💤 \n\nFrom the moment we hope onto these platforms there\u2019s constant flow of information pushed into our minds and faces.\n\nThere is a lot of great things on these platforms but also a lot of negative that will drain your day.\n\nIf you notice seeing those negative things don\u2019t  improve your day and have a negative influence and impact....Remove it, take a break to recoup, or minimize using them to a healthy level. \n\n5. KNOWING YOU, YES YOU, ARE STRONG, WORTHY, AND ABLE TO GET THROUGH THIS! 💪 \n\nWe often look towards other people to fill something we are feeling we are lacking.\nFor example, say I am so fricken sad, and I want jesse my boyfriend to cheer me up to feel better. Sometimes that works but we forget we have the power to do that for ourselves.\n\nJust like all of this going on. We all have the power to get ourselves through this.

That is why we have been witnessing countless nations clashing for control of Libya and tensions rising. The virus and pandemic has destroyed the economies and health system of many nations around the world especially in Europe which include Italy, Spain and France. Despite this we have witnessed the leader of the EU Germany open the borders of the EU to many countries and declared a hidden embargo on Turkey. In the past week we have witnessed tensions rise between France and Turkey, this tells us that all of this is for political purposes and not for health purposes. The EU is clashing with Turkey for control in Libya. Experts have now said that Germany is pressuring smaller European nations into cutting trade ties with Turkey. The reason for this is because of Africa, Libya and the Mediterranean. Turkey\u2019s Minister of Defense had announced that France supporting General Haftar goes against the alliance and partnership Turkey and France have. In addition, that French war ships had illegally intercepted Turkish ships in the Mediterranean. \n\nFollow OTRV On YouTube at: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCarPLihJWmTWgWk8pOPI0tA\/\nFollow OTRV On Twitter At: https:\/\/twitter.com\/OTRVideos\nFollow OTRV On Facebook At: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/offtherecord.otrv.3\n\n#mediterranean #germany🇩🇪 #libya #us #deepstate #globalism #german #eu #france #turkey #american #europeanunion #dgap #mediterraneansea #africa #african #pandemic2020 #virus #spain #embargo #sanctions #uae #greece #egypt","NumberOfLikes":4,"Hashtags":["#mediterranean","#germany🇩🇪","#libya","#us","#deepstate","#globalism","#german","#eu","#france","#turkey","#american","#europeanunion","#dgap","#mediterraneansea","#africa","#african","#pandemic2020","#virus","#spain","#embargo","#sanctions","#uae","#greece","#egypt"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by OTRV on August 19, 2020.

A delightful way to start the day.\n.\nThis was the fuel-up breakfast I made for my kids and I this morning before we went canoeing together for the first time. It was filling and satisfying.\n.\nAnd the whole experience was awesome. I loved canoeing with my kids \u2014 so. Much. Fun.\n.\nThis summer hasn\u2019t been the one I envisioned. Our usual beach trips and family visits were cancelled. There have been no camps, no musical production for my daughter and no cross country team practices for my son. \n.\nBut that\u2019s just what didn\u2019t happen. It doesn\u2019t tell the story of what did happen. We\u2019ve hiked, biked, explored, swam and canoed. We\u2019ve spent so much time together too \u2014 not just doing things by cooking, cleaning and enjoying our space.\n.\nThis is a hard time \u2014 a time when we have had to weigh our desires for normalcy and plans against our need to stay healthy. But even though it\u2019s hard, unexpected and unusual, it\u2019s also made many bright moments.\n.\nThose are the ones I will choose to remember. Years from now, when people ask, I will say that we masked up and practiced social distancing, we wore masks and canceled trips. But I will say that despite the hardship, it was a good time. It brought my kids and I closer together. And we did a lot of things we wouldn\u2019t have made time for in normal times \u2014 and that was glorious.\n.\n#biscuits #breakfast #breakfastideas #breakfasttime #biscuitlove #eggs #egglover #pandemiclife #pandemic2020 #pandemicparenting #eeeeeats #feedfeed #feastagram #huffposttaste","NumberOfLikes":23,"Hashtags":["#biscuits","#breakfast","#breakfastideas","#breakfasttime","#biscuitlove","#eggs","#egglover","#pandemiclife","#pandemic2020","#pandemicparenting","#eeeeeats","#feedfeed","#feastagram","#huffposttaste"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Sarah Walker Caron on August 19, 2020.

Most people infected will experience a mild to moderate respiratory illness, whilst others will show no symptoms at all. However for some the effects are severe and longer lasting.\n\nOur aim in this yoga programme is to play some role in aiding the process of recovery. By only requiring the use of mostly basic props and furniture, we have tried to make the poses as accessible as possible for everyone.\n\nThe programme was compiled thanks to advice and guidance from Abhijata Iyengar, Lois Steinberg, Gulnaaz Dashti, Stephanie Quirk, the IY(UK) Therapy Committee, IY(UK) teachers who have experienced the virus themselves, and decades of work by BKS Iyengar and Dr Geeta S. Iyengar in medical classes at RIMYI in Pune.\n\nSee the link in our bio to access the video and booklet, which are both freely available.

So lets have a look at why we are having such a reaction & what we can do to limit some of the damage!\n ✨\nThe biggest issue with face masks is the condensation from our breath. This condensation creates a warm & moist environment; leading to blocked pores, bacteria growth and irritation. Inflammatory conditions such as Dermatitis, Psoriasis, Acne & Rosacea are irritated & flare ups are common. The tightness of the face coverings also create friction, rashes & in some instances, hives. One of the biggest issues of this new micro-climate is that it causes the skin to sweat more, whilst the masks simultaneously absorb the skins natural oils. Thus leaving our skin dry, producing excess sebum & sore\/flaky.\n ✨\nIf you are not a frontline (Healthcare) worker, then always use face coverings made from a breathable fabric (stay far away from synthetics), wash it regularly & try to limit any make up worn. TLC is paramount, so make sure you are supplying adequate hydration & then locking this in with an emollient \u2013 reapplication may be required multiple times throughout the day. The right facial oil may also be beneficial at this time to sooth certain conditions, keep the skin flexible & limit irritation. Also try to limit known skin irritants if you will be wearing a mask directly afterwards eg, acids, retinol, fragrance, tea tree\/witch hazel.\n✨\n#pandemic2020 #pandemic #facemasks #facemaskselfie #skinproblems #skinproblemsolution #healthcareworkers #healthcareheroes #ppe #skin #skincare #skincaretips #skinspecialist #acne #acnetreatment #dermatitis #eczema #sensitiveskin #cheltenham #cheltenhamlife #cheltenhamwomeninbusiness #cotswolds #cotswold #cotswoldlife #gloucestershire","NumberOfLikes":28,"Hashtags":["#pandemic2020","#pandemic","#facemasks","#facemaskselfie","#skinproblems","#skinproblemsolution","#healthcareworkers","#healthcareheroes","#ppe","#skin","#skincare","#skincaretips","#skinspecialist","#acne","#acnetreatment","#dermatitis","#eczema","#sensitiveskin","#cheltenham","#cheltenhamlife","#cheltenhamwomeninbusiness","#cotswolds","#cotswold","#cotswoldlife","#gloucestershire"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Advanced Skin Cheltenham in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.

Most people infected will experience a mild to moderate respiratory illness, whilst others will show no symptoms at all. However for some the effects are severe and longer lasting.\n\nTheir aim in this yoga programme is to play some role in aiding the process of recovery. By only requiring the use of mostly basic props and furniture, they have tried to make the poses as accessible as possible for everyone.\n\nThe programme was compiled thanks to advice and guidance from Abhijata Iyengar, Lois Steinberg, Gulnaaz Dashti, Stephanie Quirk, the IY(UK) Therapy Committee, IY(UK) teachers who have experienced the virus themselves, and decades of work by BKS Iyengar and Dr Geeta S. Iyengar in medical classes at RIMYI in Pune.\n\nSee the link in their bio to access the video and booklet, which are both freely available.

Time for a pandemic check in. For many of us, we've spent 5 months mostly stuck in our homes. For me, sometimes it just feels normal. Other times I feel trapped or claustrophobic or angry or sad. (On rough days, all of those at once.)\n\nIt's hard. There's no way for it to be easy.\n\nBut in case you haven't gotten outside much lately, I want to remind you: nature is so healing. \n\nI took this picture on a hike with my family a couple of weeks ago. It was SO HOT and I was red-faced and sweaty and tired, so I'm not hitting you with some kind of magical perfection here. But despite the heat, I was restored by the sky, the trees, the river I swam in later that day, the hawks that flew right over my head.\n\nOn days when it feels like too much, take a walk. If you can go to some green space, even better. Or just go outside, watch the sky for 10 minutes, and put your bare feet on the earth. I think you'll feel better.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#nature #naturetherapy #naturemedicine #getoutside #stressrelief #stressmanagement #pandemic #pandemic2020 #covid19 #grounding","NumberOfLikes":17,"Hashtags":["#nature","#naturetherapy","#naturemedicine","#getoutside","#stressrelief","#stressmanagement","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#covid19","#grounding"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Arden Yingling, MAcOM, LAc on August 19, 2020.

Raw honey has been traditionally used in preventing infections and wound healing and can be taken in many forms: radish infused honey, tangerine infused honey, honey mixed with apple cider vinegar to enhance immune strength. Chopped garlic steeped in raw honey for 10 mins can be used to alleviate dry cough and\/or sore throat. There are numerous studies on honey about its anti-bacterial properties*:\n-\thoney draws moisture out of the environment and thus dehydrates bacteria\n-\thoney is acidic (pH 3.2-4.5) and inhibits the growth of most microorganisms\n-\tIts glucose oxidase produces hydrogen peroxide is an important antibacterial compound\n-\tIt contains several phytochemical factors for antibacterial activity\nRaw honey is unfiltered and unpasturized hence preserving all of its antibacterial properties. \nNote that children under one or people who are allergic to pollen should not take honey.\n*Eteraf-Oskouei T, Najafi M.
