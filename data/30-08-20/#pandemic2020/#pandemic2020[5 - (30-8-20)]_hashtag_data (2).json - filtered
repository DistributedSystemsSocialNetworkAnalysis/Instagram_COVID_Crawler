So don\u2019t put your #investment decisions and financial planning on hold just to wait for the situation to become normal.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has brought the world to a standstill. Probably, this is one of the biggest crises in the last 75 years. However, the pandemic is temporary and most of us are going to sail through this tough time. Moreover, experiencing such a difficult time makes us better prepared for the future.

A crisis like this can keep people out of the job #market for a very long time and also bring unexpected large medical expenditures. We should be prepared for the worst and make the necessary arrangements to make sure we get to live our normal life.\n\nHaving an emergency fund of at least two years of expenditure could give us adequate protection to fight any future unforeseen circumstances.

If it\u2019s family insurance then coverage definitely needs to be higher than Rs 5 lakh. Investors should consider having low-cost top-up insurance to increase the coverage amount.

This mystery novel, my 3rd by this author, was set in the sweltering Australia outback, investigating a suspicious heat exposure death. Appropriately, shortly before snapping this pic, I went on a 6.5 mile date hike with my husband in Canyon of the Ancients during the sweltering heat of the day, forgetting that I am no longer the desert rat I was a decade ago when I worked in archaeology in the southwest, so I really got to appreciate the beauty of the desert again, and get wayyyyyy too hot for the first time in ages. I kept my eye on the prize (an icy beverage I knew was waiting for me and chilling in the fridge and a leg of lamb for dinner), and pushed through to the final sweaty finish line triumphantly and luckily not quite heat-striken. A much needed escape from the rat race of life (and next week, on-line school) with loved ones I hadn't seen since December for my first real \"vacation\" during the pandemic, in a rather socially distant and majestic canyon.\n\n#thedry #thelostman #cortez #pandemic2020\n#bookstagram #bibliophile #hammocks #colorado #deserts #ranchlife #sheep #cows #canyonsoftheancients #canyons #instareads #janeharper #summernights #summervibes","NumberOfLikes":26,"Hashtags":["#thedry","#thelostman","#cortez","#pandemic2020","#bookstagram","#bibliophile","#hammocks","#colorado","#deserts","#ranchlife","#sheep","#cows","#canyonsoftheancients","#canyons","#instareads","#janeharper","#summernights","#summervibes"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by EstrR Reads in Estes in Canyons of the Ancients National Monument.

For a lot of us that means having a STABLE job. \n\nJOB security- implies that your job is safe for the foreseeable future and hopefully till retirement. It can provide a lot of benefits. It provides you with a steady income as long as your job is secure. Most people seek security because it is a simple way to earn a living, your employer has your job and income covered. The sad truth about this NO job is really safe anymore. \n\nINCOME security- can mean your income never comes from one single source, if one source fails you have other sources to tap into, and eventually replace the failed sources with new ones. You create  and are maintaining a portfolio of income streams. \n\nWith the economy and employment conditions we are facing today i think its important to create income security. \n\nThere are various ways to create income security, one of them is self employment, I myself chose to start a business so i could create that income security. With the pandemic going on and many people being laid off, myself included, i reevaluated my relationship with my job and decided it was time to make a change and fight for that income security and be apart of something that is recession proof. My favourite thing is being in control of my income, and the fact that its more secure then any other jobs i have had, i rather have all the power and my personal freedom instead. #income #streamsofincome #helpingothers #freedom #job #security #career #opportunity #security #stability #pandemic2020 #incomestreams #incomeopportunities #calgary #jobloss #searchforbetter","NumberOfLikes":18,"Hashtags":["#income","#streamsofincome","#helpingothers","#freedom","#job","#security","#career","#opportunity","#security","#stability","#pandemic2020","#incomestreams","#incomeopportunities","#calgary","#jobloss","#searchforbetter"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Chealsey Lewis in Calgary, Alberta.

So proud to be part of this important project. \n\nReposting @iyengaryoga_uk:‚†Ä\n\n\"The IY(UK) Therapy Committee has created a video and compiled a booklet with a suggested yoga programme to support recovery from Covid-19. ‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nAs we know, Covid-19 is a highly infectious disease caused by the coronavirus. Most people infected will experience a mild to moderate respiratory illness, whilst others will show no symptoms at all. However for some the effects are severe and longer lasting.‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nOur aim in this yoga programme is to play some role in aiding the process of recovery. By only requiring the use of mostly basic props and furniture, we have tried to make the poses as accessible as possible for everyone.‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nThe programme was compiled thanks to advice and guidance from Abhijata Iyengar, Lois Steinberg, Gulnaaz Dashti, Stephanie Quirk, the IY(UK) Therapy Committee, IY(UK) teachers who have experienced the virus themselves, and decades of work by BKS Iyengar and Dr Geeta S. Iyengar in medical classes at RIMYI in Pune.‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nSee the link in our bio to access the video and booklet, which are both freely available.

Let me explain the picture on this post. For the moment I live in South Korea (no Im not Korean) , this picture was taken at my local gym on August 19th. On the left side of the pic we have a column that depicts a person that is infected with Covid-19. On the right side we have a peson that is not infected with Covid-19. Now according to this propaganda piece of laminated paper, if you and the infected person are wearing a mask the possibility of infection is 1.5%. If the infected and the none infected are not wearing a mask then the possibility of infection is 100%. Now I dont know if any of you remember this but around 5 months ago the WHO was against wearing a mask and even said that wearing a mask doesn't protect you from the virus. They were right but as soon as Trump dropped financial aid support for the WHO , they sided with communist China and changed their mindset regarding the mask. The mask doesn't protect you from shit, that is the point of this posting. It only slowly poisons your lungs by breathing your own C02. The mask is only a symbol of communist compliance to the government, that is the only purpose for it. \n\nNow for my fellow Koreans, please wake up! Stop believing the mainstream news, stop watching your apps about infected people, those numbers are fake most of the time. Even if you die from a heart attack some hospitals are labeling the cause of death as Covid-19 in order to get funding. Stop trusting your government, they are best friends with communist China and have no interest in fixing this situation at all other than continuing on inposing this stupid rules. Yeah Korea is safe from the chaos in the West, but nothing last forever and soon Korea will fall into civil unrest...people can only take so much before they explode and decide that enough is fucking enough!! The mask is a symbol of communism plain and simple.

The thing that I did every day, and tried so hard to meet some arbitrary definition of \"good'\" or at least \"good enough to show people and not feel subpar.\" It is sad to me now, that after 10 years of playing guitar, I never felt good enough to show anyone.\n\nPerfectionism is a soul sucking lie, and I am trying to actively fight against that in aerial, both for myself and for my students. This is the first \"real\" sequence I choreographed for my students after our studio opened for private lessons. This recording of it is far from perfect.

There are plenty of hurdles before any new invention can hit the market, but the team seems quite gung-ho about their prospects.\n\n#masks #facemasks #covid #covid19awareness #nanomaterial #sarscov2 #sars #covid19 #N95masks #microorganisms #virus #pandemic2020 #epidemic #pharmacist #pharmafacts #factspharma #factsonly #didyouknowfact #pharmfacts","NumberOfLikes":13,"Hashtags":["#masks","#facemasks","#covid","#covid19awareness","#nanomaterial","#sarscov2","#sars","#covid19","#N95masks","#microorganisms","#virus","#pandemic2020","#epidemic","#pharmacist","#pharmafacts","#factspharma","#factsonly","#didyouknowfact","#pharmfacts"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by PharmaClass on August 18, 2020.

Most people infected will experience a mild to moderate respiratory illness, whilst others will show no symptoms at all. However for some the effects are severe and longer lasting.\n\nOur aim in this yoga programme is to play some role in aiding the process of recovery. By only requiring the use of mostly basic props and furniture, we have tried to make the poses as accessible as possible for everyone.\n\nThe programme was compiled thanks to advice and guidance from Abhijata Iyengar, Lois Steinberg, Gulnaaz Dashti, Stephanie Quirk, the IY(UK) Therapy Committee, IY(UK) teachers who have experienced the virus themselves, and decades of work by BKS Iyengar and Dr Geeta S.

Oh sure being a millionaire would be nice, but a millionaire who can\u2019t rest? What good is all that money if I can\u2019t sleep on it??\n\nI\u2019m being tongue in cheek of course, but I continue to TRY to be good at resting. There are just so many things that get in the way. For a little while I was thinking that this was me, that it was my fault I was bad at resting. But lately I\u2019ve noticed that resting is a TREND, so it\u2019s not just me.\n\nWhen I say TREND, I mean I\u2019ve noticed an increase in the amount of memes, pep talks, justifications and content around the topic of rest. I\u2019m defining rest as doing nothing or sleeping. That\u2019s IT.  I get it, we\u2019re all armpits deep in this pandemic, and our collective ability to learn new things (Homeschool! Masking! Working from home! Working from home while homeschooling and masking!) has been put to the ultimate tests. 2020, it\u2019s been a bit much.\n\n BUt all this learning is tiring, and it\u2019s had us leaning hard into the indulgences of \u201Cself-care capitalism\u201D. For some, it\u2019s online shopping, for others it\u2019s hours of video games, for many it\u2019s all the chips and cereal you can handle after 8pm. #becausecovid seems to be all the reason we need to justify these choices, while posting to socials and getting a resounding reply: \u201Cmeeeee toooooo!\u201D\n\nAnd lately, although slowly, I\u2019ve started to see people mention their struggle with actual rest. Indulgence is one thing, but it can ALWAYS be multitasked between Zoom calls, or layered into the late night hours after the kids are in bed. Indulgences labeled as \u201Cself-care\u201D rarely get in the way of our productivity. If anything they provide evidence of being PRODUCTIVE. \u201CLOOK AT THIS,\u201D we share online, \u201CI HAVE SELF CARED.\u201D But what did it take out of us?\n\nWe all seem to know that rest would help us manage our shared sense of foreboding and doom, yet it\u2019s the hardest \u201Cvice\u201D to embrace. We\u2019ve all been quarantined at home, and yet no one\u2019s instituted a national nap time? #idliketospeakwiththemanager\n\n**continues in comments","NumberOfLikes":20,"Hashtags":["#becausecovid","#idliketospeakwiththemanager"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":17,"Timestamp":1597755465,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 18 14:57:45 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"thegoodindahood","CaptionText":"Life in a pandemic.\n\n..with regular gloves on small hands\n\n#coronavirus #covid19 #airplane #windowview #corona #pandemic #pandemic2020 #amateurphotography #changes #coronatime #biggloves?","NumberOfLikes":8,"Hashtags":["#coronavirus","#covid19","#airplane","#windowview","#corona","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#amateurphotography","#changes","#coronatime","#biggloves?"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Curating Goodness on August 18, 2020.

My thought is they will have two each day so they can switch it out, but we will see how what ends up being best. \n\nThe disposable face masks are so they can switch out to those at any point in the day.

Ask what they need. It\u2019s possible to exude a positive attitude and still interact with others in a caring way. That\u2019s when positivity is not toxic.\u201D\n\nThere are a lot of reasons to feel down right now. The news cycle is a constant reminder of the havoc the coronavirus pandemic is causing on a local, national and global scale. Health concerns, frustration, loneliness, and financial uncertainty are having a widespread impact on mental health, with two-thirds of people saying they feel nervous, depressed, lonely, or hopeless during at least one of their last seven days, according to the COVID Impact Survey.\n.\n.\n#ctrlaltzen #bebettereveryday #payalmahapatra #healthandwellnesscoach #healthcoaching #holistichealthcoach #functionalmedicinecoach #healthcoachtips #healthcoachlife #coachesofinstagram #toxicpositivity #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife #mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #corporatewellness #corporatehealth #healthconcious #lonliness #frustration #anxiety #depressionawareness #physicalhealth #guthealth #hormonehealth #financialhealth #circleoflife #primaryfood #uncertainty #uncertaintimes \n@what.is.mental.illness : image credit","NumberOfLikes":24,"Hashtags":["#ctrlaltzen","#bebettereveryday","#payalmahapatra","#healthandwellnesscoach","#healthcoaching","#holistichealthcoach","#functionalmedicinecoach","#healthcoachtips","#healthcoachlife","#coachesofinstagram","#toxicpositivity","#pandemic2020","#pandemiclife","#mentalhealth","#mentalhealthawareness","#corporatewellness","#corporatehealth","#healthconcious","#lonliness","#frustration","#anxiety","#depressionawareness","#physicalhealth","#guthealth","#hormonehealth","#financialhealth","#circleoflife","#primaryfood","#uncertainty","#uncertaintimes"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Payal Mahapatra on August 18, 2020.

Thankfully the building, and the \"Alto Nido\" sign out front that is glimpsed briefly in the film, are still there! Yay! \n\nLocated at \u202A1851 North Ivar Street\u202C in Hollywood, the Spanish-Colonial style building, with its red tile roof and wrought-iron balconies, was built in 1930 and was first used as a hotel. Around the late 1940s it was converted into an apartment home and became a residence for aspiring actors, screenwriters, and dreamers hoping to make a name for themselves in tinsel-town. \n\nPlease note that this is a private residence so if you visit please do not trespass or disturb the people that live there.\n\nDirected and co-written by Billy Wilder, \u201CSunset Blvd\u201D also stars Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond, a former silent-film star who draws Joe into her demented fantasy world, where she dreams of making a triumphant return to the screen. Erich von Stroheim plays Max von Mayerling, her devoted butler, and Nancy Olson as the fresh faced ingenue who falls for Joe. \n\nFun facts - According to The Movieland Directory, a few of the recognizable names that took up residence in Alto Nido during the golden age of Hollywood were Roscoe \u201CFatty\u201D Arbuckle, Claudette Colbert, Pat O\u2019Brien, George Cukor, and Al \u201CGrandpa Munster\u201D Lewis. \n\nThis historic apartment building is also supposedly one of the places Elizabeth Short, \u201CThe Black Dahlia\", lived before her brutal murder. Hence, it was used in the 2006 movie, \u201CThe Black Dahlia\u201D\n\n\u201CSunset Boulevard\u201D was nominated for 11 Academy Awards(including nominations in all four acting categories) and won three. It is often ranked among the greatest movies ever made. #filminglocation #altonidoapartments #joegillis #sunsetboulevardmovie #hollywoodtour #pandemic2020 #socialdistancing #wearamask #tonymiros","NumberOfLikes":43,"Hashtags":["#filminglocation","#altonidoapartments","#joegillis","#sunsetboulevardmovie","#hollywoodtour","#pandemic2020","#socialdistancing","#wearamask","#tonymiros"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":5,"Timestamp":1597687523,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 20:05:23 CEST 2020","Location":"Alto Nido"},{"Owner":"ellen_wildman","CaptionText":"Man it\u2019s been a üí© storm around here the last month or so.

No asthma. No nothing. His pediatrician said put him in! @cchidest \n-He\u2019s young for his age in his grade. He just turned 8 a few months ago. Usually due to this, developmentally, he does well in a structured setting esp. the start of the school year. \n-He is very obedient under the supervision of anyone but his parents. ;) I know he will make sure to follow and practice all of the rules of social distancing!!\n-He has a history of separation anxiety & social anxiety. He does much better being around kids to overcome these genetic nuisances he inherited from both sides of his family. This was the biggest reason we felt that this kiddo had to go back to school. After two months of being homeschooled & away from his peers this spring, he hid behind me when he saw his cousin & was anxious. That was the red flag that caused me to think, this is NOT a good situation!!\n\nPrayers to all on the decisions you have made for your children. God only knows we are trying to do what\u2019s best! Unfortunately, no decision is a perfect one in the setting of a pandemic. \n\nSchool may end up being completely virtual anyway at the end of the day, but at least we can say we tried! \n\n#mentalhealthmatters #benefitsvsrisks #prayingforthebest‚ù§Ô∏è #dolphin4life #dogwood #dogwoodelementaryschool #thirdgradeherewecome #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":46,"Hashtags":["#mentalhealthmatters","#benefitsvsrisks","#prayingforthebest‚ù§Ô∏è","#dolphin4life","#dogwood","#dogwoodelementaryschool","#thirdgradeherewecome","#pandemic2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":14,"Timestamp":1597686125,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 19:42:05 CEST 2020","Location":"Germantown, Tennessee"},{"Owner":"ritaguidashow","CaptionText":"Booked it!

Third grade is looking a lot different than I ever had imagined. I\u2019m very anxious I\u2019m not going to lie. I had to set up a space for the girls with my old office desk so that they could have a separate space designated for school. They are to check in every morning via zoom at 8am and then receive assignments daily. They will then have 2 other zoom meetings throughout the day. There will be snack break and lunch break but there isn\u2019t a hall pass needed to use the restroom. They won\u2019t be running to meet their friends for recess and any questions they have on their school work will be directed to their mommy. \n.\nThe pressure and anxiety that is helping my girls learn is a lot. My girls are in a dual language program, meaning 80% of their day is in Spanish. Yes I speak it, they speak it and we are all 100% fluent.  But can I teach in Spanish? Can I answer math and science and writing comprehension questions in Spanish? We will have to see. Yes we did this from March to June but it was different. The teacher knew the kids by then. She knew how to group them, what to assign to them based on their abilities and well to be honest we all thought it was over with in June.\n.\nBut this is third grade. It\u2019s a new school year, a new teacher and a much higher expectation. They are expected to sit and learn from 8-2, they are expected to not get distracted at home and learn a brand new curriculum. My heart aches for them. They said the only thing they wish for is for school to open again. üò≠ \n.\nBut here we are. Doing the best we can. It seems like nothing else matters right now because of how overwhelmed I feel but I know there are so many others in this same boat. So remember to be kind to each other, to lean on anyone that can help and to not judge each other because this is all such a difficult time for so many of us! Good luck to all the kiddos and teachers starting school from afar.

I know this may seem like its getting old when I say this but it\u2019s so freakin essential people. Exercise is THE BEST COPING MECHANISM PERIOD. Without it I guarantee I and many others around me would be depressed and anxious. Exercise helps me deal with life\u2019s shortcomings and improves the one and only vessel I will ever own. Exercise makes me want to put better foods into my body. \n\nExercise stimulates the release of endogenous opioid peptides responsible for changes in our mood, anxiety, and performance.\n\nExercise also triggers Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor(BDNF) that is like fertilizer for our brains. BDNF helps maintain the life and growth of our brain cells. Low levels of BDNF have been associated with depression, anxiety, poor memory and brain degeneration as seen in conditions such as Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia.\n\nExercise in moderate amounts also helps support your microbiome due to its stress reducing effects. Moderate Exercise increases the number of beneficial microbial species and enriches microbial diversity as well as enhanced short-chain fatty acid synthesis and carbohydrate metabolism that promotes the function of your intestinal lining thus improving the regulation of your immune system.\n\nI could go on and on and would put exercise as just as important as eating the right foods. It will help you become your best self. Little by little day by day add in just another minute of exercise. Many people exercise like they do diets. Being extreme for a bit then falling off the wagon. Exercise and eating what\u2019s right for your body are life-style changes you should slowly adapt to. Life is a marathon, not a sprint.","NumberOfLikes":47,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Lucas McCabe on August 17, 2020.

There were many positives like double-pained windows, air conditioning in the bedroom, and the fabulous rooftop garden terrace. However it was very small, which was not an issue when I rented it in February and was out most of the time, but became a big issue when CV19 caused a lockdown.  Plus, it was a very new modern apartment and I tend to prefer something older with charm, character and heart.\nüíù\nMy apartment in Patzcuaro is amazing! I am across the street from a Buddhist retreat center. I have a large private courtyard; my puppy and I spend a lot of time out there. There is a second bedroom, a laundry room, and a very sweet atrium\/meditation room off the kitchen. When I got rid of most of my possessions before moving to Mexico, letting go of my art collection was difficult. My current landlord is an art collector so my apartment is full of art and handmade furniture. My upstairs neighbor is very friendly and kind. When I had a root canal the 2nd week I was here, she made me homemade carrot ginger soup. She has taken me to her favorite places and introduced me to her friends. She is in love with my puppy and frequently comes down to the courtyard to play with Zooey. \nüíù\nSpirit found me the perfect place to live \u2014 it checked all my boxes \u2014 nurturing, inspiring, relaxing, great central location, and recharges me.

Generational conditioning (probably not the correct term, but my brain fogged brain is saying we're using it) is a large part of how old ways of thinking are able to survive the years. Which can be okay when you're talking about things that help us keep a civilized society, but can be really bad when bias and hate are also thrown in there under the guise of \"it's how things are,\" or other \"lessons\" that teach good things but then have that undercurrent of bad. I mean, at one point, and maybe it's even still being taught somewhere, white people taught their children that enslaving black people was okay. We know it's not, now- but it does show how something so wrong can be accepted because \"It's how things are,\" or \"it's tradition.\" The same can happen with politics. Some families are very political and teach their children that the only correct side is whichever party they are in. Then they grow up not really knowing anything else, and their perspective is so limited, they are incapable of seeing when things aren't right in their own party. They are conditioned to believe the government works perfectly and grow up to not question it, as long as the right party is in power. We have to break this conditioning if we don't want this country to crumble. This same thing can happen with relationships and all kinds of other things. People often repeat the behaviors of their parents unless they can break the cycle. Search for these things within yourself and work on them.

Untuk yang sedang merangkak sedikit demi sedikit, kalian hebat! Keadaan mengajarkan untuk lebih sabar, ikhlas, dan lebih keras untuk berusaha dan berdoa. Keadaan menyadarkan betapa besar kuasa Tuhan.\n\nKembali aku ingat kesombonganku di waktu lalu, seakan yakin bahwa pekerjaan yg kujalani ini pasti. \u201COrang nikah akan selalu ada, jasa MUA selalu dibutuhkan. Astaghfirullahaladzim. Kembali lagi disadarkan, tidak ada yg tidak mungkin untuk Allah. Kun fayakun! Sebelumnya blm pernah terbesit dipikiranku bahwa akan ada larangan pesta pernikahan, peraturan acara akad maksimal 30 orang, wisuda online, dan yang lainnya lagi. Sombong. Sombong. Sombong. Untuk dijadikan pelajaran, bahwa semua yg ada di bumi adalah kehendak Allah. Belum lagi keluh kesah yg sering aku ucapkan dulu, aku bilang capek, aku bilang pingin cuti kerja lamaaaa banget, aku bilang pingin tidur enak tanpa mikir kerjaan tanpa punya beban tanpa dikejar-kejar pengantin, aku bilang weekend pingin bangun siang ga bangun jam 2 pagi terus, aku bilang malam minggu pgn jalan-jalan bukan prepare kerjaan. Ya ampun. Tertampar. Semua dikabulkan Tuhan. Masa sulit ini bener bener jadi pembelajaran untukku. Belajar lebih bersyukur, belajar tidak sombong, belajar ikhlas dan masih banyak yg lainnya.\n\nSekarang bagaimana?\n\nKhawatir besok nggak bisa makan aja udh sama dengan menghina Tuhan. Optimis! Khusnudzon sama Allah. \u201CGusti Allah ra bingung mergo\u201D, kalimat yg sering diucapkan ibu mertuaku. Yg artinya, Allah ga bingung buat cari alasan untuk kasih kita rejeki. Bisa dari mana aja, kapan aja, tanpa kita duga. Yaaa... dan memang bener aku sepakat. \n\nIni ceritaku. Aku tau kalian punya cerita masing-masing tentang keadaan sekarang ini.

We understood complicated disease processes, we had treatment plans, medications, and a plan of care. But now? It\u2019s all out the window. We have anecdotal medications and treatments. We don\u2019t really know if what we\u2019re doing is the best care. We don\u2019t understand the disease process, the tornado it causes on the other systems of the body, if there\u2019s any valuable correlation between antibodies and long term protection. We have hypotheses.\n\nSo when families ask us questions and we\u2019re left saying, \u201CI don\u2019t know\u201D it frustrates us as much as it frustrates them. Because we\u2019re used to knowing, to having answers, and knowing how to save our patients.\n\nOur days are spent worrying about oxygen saturation, trusting our nursing gut when something is off but we can\u2019t explain it, increasing oxygen delivery, updating families, coordinating with the physicians, praying we have an ICU bed available when our patient is tanking.\n\nWe are running out of beds, out of ventilators, out of vapotherms. Our staff is getting covid in waves. We\u2019re treating our coworkers. We run and nurse all day long and when we get home it catches up with us.\n\nWe are tired. We are exhausted. We are bruised and battered. We are crying because we have our patients for days or weeks and we become attached to them and their families. We bond and love and care for them like they\u2019re our own family. And our hearts are fucking breaking.\n\nWear a mask. Wash your hands. Be considerate. Help us so we can help you.

Kena pasalnya juga UU ITE.\nSebenarnya kami tidak memenjarakan bliau karena melecehkan, kami dokter kebanyakan juga tidak mengerti UU ITE (boleh deh di survey, paling cuma sedikit yg tahu). Kami melaporkan bliau, karena gerakan menolak masker... coba kalau benar banyak pengikut bliau yg menerapkan tdk pakai masker, maka virus ini akan makin menyebar. Saat ini saja kapasitas rumah sakit tdk mencukupi. \nBeliau juga menolak rapid... coba logika saja, maukah kalian tertular dari seseorang, karena status penyakitnya tidak diketahui.

Kids (and parents) were left confused and unsure of how to do school (and work)from home. \n\nWe had the strangest summer ever; Words like covid and corona, social distancing, 6 feet, sanitizer became the new norm.  We did drive by birthday, drive way happy hours, canceled vacations, had toilet papers shortages and passed around hand sanitizer like never before. But we also learned to enjoy the slower pace and connect more with each other, had lots of outside play time and spent many evenings outside until the sun want down! \n\nThis school year will not look like anything we have seen before, as parents we have had to make the hardest decisions EVER about how are kids would return to school (assuming you were given a choice) But in the end we made the choice that was best for our individual families. \n\nI have seen the hard work the teaches and faculty have put into to make sure everyone is safe and that kids who are learning virtually can have as normal of a year as possible\u2014- for that THANK YOU! üñ§\n\nSo tonight as I go to bed I\u2019ll keep the teachers, the staff, the kids and parents in my prayers. \n\nI hope all students and teachers retuning today school tomorrow have a great day!

I was a medical assistant full time and an ED scribe part time. I was living with roommates, had a low student loan payment from undergrad, never did anything extravagant, never traveled, but I STILL could barely make ends meet! üò£ For years I told myself that it would all be ok as soon as I got into grad school. I would have a future then, I just had to survive until I got into school. My mental health was taking a hit at this point. ü§ïI was broke and in debt with no end in sight. Meanwhile, I watched friends get married, buy houses, buy cars, have children, the list goes on. üíÉüèªGraduate school is the ultimate example of delayed gratification and I was struggling. So by the time July 2018 came around I knew I couldn\u2019t live like this anymore. I read an article talking about \u201Cbudget gurus\u201D and found @thebudgetmom. ‚ù§Ô∏èOut of all the systems I looked into her\u2019s spoke to me the most because she was paying off debt, saving for her future, and still got her nails and eyelashes done regularly. Seemed like the system for me! I literally spent my last $25 that I had in my checking account (seriously, I had like... a dollar left after this purchase) to buy her workbook and I got busy. As I show you things I\u2019ve done to get my finances under control I\u2019ll be referencing TheBudgetMom often and I highly recommend her workbook. I still use her books today and am so grateful for the financial education journey that her workbooks sparked in me! üíö\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~","NumberOfLikes":8,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Emerald, PA-S on August 16, 2020.
