But try telling that to the eccentric leader of North Korea. If reports in the media are to be believed, North Korea is facing a food supply crisis and its controversial leader has reportedly ordered his people to hand over their pet dogs so they can be turned into meat for restaurants.\nAccording to a report in the New Zealand Herald, the move by the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is thought to be aimed at quelling the rising discontent among the public as the economic situation in the secretive country is crumbling and food shortages have become a huge worry. \n\n#southkorea #foodcrisis #china #pandemic #pandemic2020 #savedogslives #savedogs","NumberOfLikes":10,"Hashtags":["#southkorea","#foodcrisis","#china","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#savedogslives","#savedogs"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597821023,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 19 09:10:23 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"memerniggas","CaptionText":"Ye majak hora hai bcüòÇüòÖ\n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n. \n#wuhan #corona #coronavirusmemes #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife #socialdistancing #life #lifechanged #pool #poolparty #enjoyinglife #restofworld #problemsolving #creative #majakhorahahai #fnv","NumberOfLikes":3,"Hashtags":["#wuhan","#corona","#coronavirusmemes","#pandemic2020","#pandemiclife","#socialdistancing","#life","#lifechanged","#pool","#poolparty","#enjoyinglife","#restofworld","#problemsolving","#creative","#majakhorahahai","#fnv"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by MEMER NIGGAüî• on August 19, 2020.

Let me explain the picture on this post. For the moment I live in South Korea (no Im not Korean) , this picture was taken at my local gym on August 19th. On the left side of the pic we have a column that depicts a person that is infected with Covid-19. On the right side we have a peson that is not infected with Covid-19. Now according to this propaganda piece of laminated paper, if you and the infected person are wearing a mask the possibility of infection is 1.5%. If the infected and the none infected are not wearing a mask then the possibility of infection is 100%. Now I dont know if any of you remember this but around 5 months ago the WHO was against wearing a mask and even said that wearing a mask doesn't protect you from the virus. They were right but as soon as Trump dropped financial aid support for the WHO , they sided with communist China and changed their mindset regarding the mask. The mask doesn't protect you from shit, that is the point of this posting. It only slowly poisons your lungs by breathing your own C02. The mask is only a symbol of communist compliance to the government, that is the only purpose for it. \n\nNow for my fellow Koreans, please wake up! Stop believing the mainstream news, stop watching your apps about infected people, those numbers are fake most of the time. Even if you die from a heart attack some hospitals are labeling the cause of death as Covid-19 in order to get funding. Stop trusting your government, they are best friends with communist China and have no interest in fixing this situation at all other than continuing on inposing this stupid rules. Yeah Korea is safe from the chaos in the West, but nothing last forever and soon Korea will fall into civil unrest...people can only take so much before they explode and decide that enough is fucking enough!! The mask is a symbol of communism plain and simple.

I really feel I\u2019m getting back in to my running groove again, now the weather\u2019s a little cooler, and this is making me happy!\n\nI was reflecting this morning on the uncertainty of our current situation. As a nation we have been suddenly thrown in to lockdown, then started to ease out of it, some of us have been thrown back in to it, while others of us have watched from the sidelines wondering if we will be next.\n\nIt makes it very difficult to plan for the future. Not knowing what the future will be like, or when the new normal will start. Or has it started already?\n\nHowever, what I do know is we can try to gain some control by planing and planing  and more planing. Trying to predict all eventualities. Yet, until we are in the situation, we don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to turn out.\n\nOften the things we worry about the most turn out to be fine in the end, and the things we don\u2019t think about turn out to be much bigger problems. Even without a pandemic life is full of uncertainty, and anxious planning for all eventualities can\u2019t stop that.\n\nWe are all doing the best we can, with the information we have at the time, and that is all we can do right now. So be kind to yourself. Hindsight is a wonderful thing, but sadly we don\u2019t have it until after the event.\n\n#running #motherrunner #runningformentalhealth #maternalmentalhealth #thismumruns #runner #badassmotherrunner #womensrunning #womensrunningcommunity #halfmarathontraining #mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #psychology #run #runnersofinstagram #runhappy #runtoinspire #therapistsofinstagram #motherhoodunplugged #anxiety #mentalwellbeing #mentalhealthinfluencer #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":133,"Hashtags":["#running","#motherrunner","#runningformentalhealth","#maternalmentalhealth","#thismumruns","#runner","#badassmotherrunner","#womensrunning","#womensrunningcommunity","#halfmarathontraining","#mentalhealth","#mentalhealthawareness","#psychology","#run","#runnersofinstagram","#runhappy","#runtoinspire","#therapistsofinstagram","#motherhoodunplugged","#anxiety","#mentalwellbeing","#mentalhealthinfluencer","#pandemic2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Chloe on August 18, 2020.

We learned that long ago. What it did help us remember was how to be patient & compassionate with one another, how to sit still, slow down, embrace the quiet, & be comfortable being alone with ourselves. I think these are critical lessons that our kids will value one day. And though I am thankful they want to go back to school, I\u2019m also apprehensive (as I\u2019m sure we all are) & I miss them already. \n.\nWho knows how long they\u2019ll be there.

Last year the week after we got married @scabbydoodah got to work on it. He didn\u2019t finish until July so last year we didn\u2019t get a full growing season in. It\u2019s 6x12 feet, I think his only complaint is he wishes he built it bigger. So it\u2019s deer and rabbit proof, our only pest has been caterpillars and mold on the pumpkin leaves. So far we\u2019ve harvested a variety of tomatoes, peppers, green onion, lettuce, carrots, and lots of herbs, all from seeds we started in spring inside. We have a tomatillo bush that never got pollinated. üòí Still growing cucumbers, brussel sprouts and pie pumpkins. We also put some zinnias in there to protect from pests. I just planted ginger so we\u2019ll see about that. Learned a lot about plants this year. He also had to modify it because one day I got locked in the garden so he made a little hole in the door for me to wiggle my hand out. One of the hanging baskets has basil on top and a tomato bush coming out the bottom, thanks Youtube. So trying to utilize all the space. I would love to grow some vine like loofa but we were worried about it blocking light for the others. Scott recently put in rain barrels so we can use harvested rain water to water the plants. This garden has been a lot of work, mostly done by Scott üëèüèª but it has been a wonderful distraction from my health problems. Next I\u2019m going to food process and freeze the veggies so we can enjoy all year and I\u2019m slowly collecting everything I need to start canning. The only thing I need left is a big canning pot (nevermind, thanks Facebook marketplace!). I\u2019m excited, I got special lids to ferment veggies. In the future we want to plant some deer friendly herbs outside of the garden like chives, thyme, and lemongrass. Thanks for following along on this üå± journey.

Suddenly I realised that I'm practically running the actual risk of being arrested for being at that place at that particular time. Little comfort came when I saw everybody who was in the queue suddenly becoming frantic and anxious, and I knew I was not alone. Some people were coming from work. I felt for them.\nI later pondered on the situation and began to recall that we once lived under a similar situation, but different circumstances, in South Africa during the eighties. Then it was the apartheid police.

The summer that I didn\u2019t get to do what I had originally planned, instead it was better. My summer was full of #jazztherapy on Thursday\u2019s with the amazing @alexatarantino. I was lucky to attend the Jazz Women Summit by @jazzgirlstx where I left inspired, determined and glad to have met a wonder group of women. Through that summit I was introduced to @keyofshejazz, where I indulged in a week full of learning, had a master class with the lovely @roxycoss and met another batch of amazing girls that do and like what I do. Last but certainly not least I was honored to take classes with the @jazzdotorg orchestra members in the Summer Jazz Academy online, something I probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to do in person. Probably if all these programs hadn\u2019t gone online, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to participate. I am eternally grateful. I didn\u2019t get a tan this summer, I got so much more.

No asthma. No nothing. His pediatrician said put him in! @cchidest \n-He\u2019s young for his age in his grade. He just turned 8 a few months ago. Usually due to this, developmentally, he does well in a structured setting esp. the start of the school year. \n-He is very obedient under the supervision of anyone but his parents. ;) I know he will make sure to follow and practice all of the rules of social distancing!!\n-He has a history of separation anxiety & social anxiety. He does much better being around kids to overcome these genetic nuisances he inherited from both sides of his family. This was the biggest reason we felt that this kiddo had to go back to school. After two months of being homeschooled & away from his peers this spring, he hid behind me when he saw his cousin & was anxious. That was the red flag that caused me to think, this is NOT a good situation!!\n\nPrayers to all on the decisions you have made for your children. God only knows we are trying to do what\u2019s best! Unfortunately, no decision is a perfect one in the setting of a pandemic. \n\nSchool may end up being completely virtual anyway at the end of the day, but at least we can say we tried! \n\n#mentalhealthmatters #benefitsvsrisks #prayingforthebest‚ù§Ô∏è #dolphin4life #dogwood #dogwoodelementaryschool #thirdgradeherewecome #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":46,"Hashtags":["#mentalhealthmatters","#benefitsvsrisks","#prayingforthebest‚ù§Ô∏è","#dolphin4life","#dogwood","#dogwoodelementaryschool","#thirdgradeherewecome","#pandemic2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":14,"Timestamp":1597686125,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 19:42:05 CEST 2020","Location":"Germantown, Tennessee"},{"Owner":"ritaguidashow","CaptionText":"Booked it!

Third grade is looking a lot different than I ever had imagined. I\u2019m very anxious I\u2019m not going to lie. I had to set up a space for the girls with my old office desk so that they could have a separate space designated for school. They are to check in every morning via zoom at 8am and then receive assignments daily. They will then have 2 other zoom meetings throughout the day. There will be snack break and lunch break but there isn\u2019t a hall pass needed to use the restroom. They won\u2019t be running to meet their friends for recess and any questions they have on their school work will be directed to their mommy. \n.\nThe pressure and anxiety that is helping my girls learn is a lot. My girls are in a dual language program, meaning 80% of their day is in Spanish. Yes I speak it, they speak it and we are all 100% fluent.  But can I teach in Spanish? Can I answer math and science and writing comprehension questions in Spanish? We will have to see. Yes we did this from March to June but it was different. The teacher knew the kids by then. She knew how to group them, what to assign to them based on their abilities and well to be honest we all thought it was over with in June.\n.\nBut this is third grade. It\u2019s a new school year, a new teacher and a much higher expectation. They are expected to sit and learn from 8-2, they are expected to not get distracted at home and learn a brand new curriculum. My heart aches for them. They said the only thing they wish for is for school to open again. üò≠ \n.\nBut here we are. Doing the best we can. It seems like nothing else matters right now because of how overwhelmed I feel but I know there are so many others in this same boat. So remember to be kind to each other, to lean on anyone that can help and to not judge each other because this is all such a difficult time for so many of us! Good luck to all the kiddos and teachers starting school from afar. They\u2019re the real troopers in all of this!","NumberOfLikes":359,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Erin Bulcao on August 17, 2020 tagging @kirsty_lee__, @parenting, @parents, @peanut, @pregnantish, @the.ivf.warrior, @parentchum, @adventuringthroughearlyed, @wheneverybodymatters, and @healthyivf.

I know this may seem like its getting old when I say this but it\u2019s so freakin essential people. Exercise is THE BEST COPING MECHANISM PERIOD. Without it I guarantee I and many others around me would be depressed and anxious. Exercise helps me deal with life\u2019s shortcomings and improves the one and only vessel I will ever own. Exercise makes me want to put better foods into my body. \n\nExercise stimulates the release of endogenous opioid peptides responsible for changes in our mood, anxiety, and performance.\n\nExercise also triggers Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor(BDNF) that is like fertilizer for our brains. BDNF helps maintain the life and growth of our brain cells. Low levels of BDNF have been associated with depression, anxiety, poor memory and brain degeneration as seen in conditions such as Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia.\n\nExercise in moderate amounts also helps support your microbiome due to its stress reducing effects. Moderate Exercise increases the number of beneficial microbial species and enriches microbial diversity as well as enhanced short-chain fatty acid synthesis and carbohydrate metabolism that promotes the function of your intestinal lining thus improving the regulation of your immune system.\n\nI could go on and on and would put exercise as just as important as eating the right foods. It will help you become your best self. Little by little day by day add in just another minute of exercise. Many people exercise like they do diets. Being extreme for a bit then falling off the wagon. Exercise and eating what\u2019s right for your body are life-style changes you should slowly adapt to. Life is a marathon, not a sprint.","NumberOfLikes":47,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Lucas McCabe on August 17, 2020.

I feel like I have a part of him with that name tag. It sits on my dresser.¬†\n\nHe was funny. He loved to crack jokes, he loved to write. He liked to philosophize all the time. His coworkers recorded him on Facebook when they were at lunch one day and he was philosophizing about something stupid. I really love the things his coworkers put on Facebook because I can go back and look at them.¬†\n\nHis coworkers have been great. They started calling and texting me. They bought t-shirts with his face on it and had \"T-shirt Friday\u201D at work because he and another gentleman passed away. So they either had on the other guy's t-shirt or they had on my brother's t-shirt. And they sent me a picture and it just meant so much to me because my brother was private so I didn't know he had so many friends.¬†\n\nHe passed away on March 29th. He was a diabetic. He had had amputations. So something might have been wrong with his diabetes, and then he got coronavirus on top of that.¬†\n\nPeople put their lives at risk all the time as essential workers. These are the little people who don't make a bunch of money, but they do a service for you. So don't ever forget them because a lot of the people at Walmart work at the back of Walmart, so you'll never see them. My brother worked in the back \u2014 you would have never seen him.\u201D¬†\n\nWBEZ\u2019s @nueli photographed Angela McMiller wearing a shirt with a photo of her brother, Phillip Thomas, on it.

Generational conditioning (probably not the correct term, but my brain fogged brain is saying we're using it) is a large part of how old ways of thinking are able to survive the years. Which can be okay when you're talking about things that help us keep a civilized society, but can be really bad when bias and hate are also thrown in there under the guise of \"it's how things are,\" or other \"lessons\" that teach good things but then have that undercurrent of bad. I mean, at one point, and maybe it's even still being taught somewhere, white people taught their children that enslaving black people was okay. We know it's not, now- but it does show how something so wrong can be accepted because \"It's how things are,\" or \"it's tradition.\" The same can happen with politics. Some families are very political and teach their children that the only correct side is whichever party they are in. Then they grow up not really knowing anything else, and their perspective is so limited, they are incapable of seeing when things aren't right in their own party. They are conditioned to believe the government works perfectly and grow up to not question it, as long as the right party is in power. We have to break this conditioning if we don't want this country to crumble. This same thing can happen with relationships and all kinds of other things. People often repeat the behaviors of their parents unless they can break the cycle. Search for these things within yourself and work on them.

A three-judge bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra said that 'life has to go on' despite Covid and the court cannot put career of students in peril by interfering with the decision of the National Testing Agency.'Career of students cannot be put in peril. We find no merit in the petition. The petition is dismissed', the bench which also comprised justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari said.'You (lawyers) have demanded opening of physical courts.But you want exams to be postponed. Postponment of exams is a loss for country,' the bench said.Petitioner's lawyer Alakh Alok Srivastava said that vaccine for Covid is 'on its way' and he is not seeking an indefinite postponment of the exams. But the bench found no merit in the case.Another petition praying that NEET and JEE should be held as per schedule, was withdrawn by the petitioner after the court rejected the plea seeking postponement.Earlier this month, a plea was filed before the Supreme Court by 11 students belonging to 11 states seeking the postponement of JEE and NEET 2020 exams till the situation due to the covid-19 pandemic normalizes. The plea sought quashing of National Testing Agency's (NTA) July 3 notice, to hold of JEE and NEET entrance examination in September.As per the public notices notified by the NTA, JEE (Main) 2020 exam is scheduled to be held from September 1-6, while the NEET-UG 2020 exam is scheduled for September 13.\nConducting JEE and NEET at this stage will put lives of lakhs of young students in danger, the petition filed by 11 JEE\/NEET aspirants said. 'The best recourse at this stage can be to wait for some more time, let Covid-19 Crisis subside and then only conduct these Exams, in order to save the lives of the students and their parents,' the petition said.\nEarlier, JEE mains was scheduled to be conducted in April and May respectively, which was later postponed due to the Covid-19 disease outbreak.\n#jee #neet #exam #education\n#supremecourt #rejection\n#petition #ntaneet\n#covid19 #pandemic2020\n#exam2020  #students #ugc","NumberOfLikes":7,"Hashtags":["#jee","#neet","#exam","#education","#supremecourt","#rejection","#petition","#ntaneet","#covid19","#pandemic2020","#exam2020","#students","#ugc"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by @connecting_dots1947 on August 17, 2020.

Some of us are there who are enjoying the lock down at home by making various dishes and enjoying it with our family, whereas there are some people who are breaking their savings to remain alive. \n\nI'm not talking about the poor people no! Atleast they are getting free foods, but just think once about the middle class people,do you think they are living happily? They are the ones who are suffering the  most. They want the lock down to get over soon ,so that they catch up with their work, not because they are bored or pissed off at home rather because they are not getting paid. They want money badly. They are in need of it. They cannot show that like poor peoples but they are fighting for it very badly.\n\nDonating money, isn't the solution for these people's. Just take a moment and think once , your coaching centres which are of private are the lectures getting paid in this Lockdown? Atleast half of the salary? No. They are not getting even a penny. Can you think how they might be surviving? \n\nI know everyone must be feeling bad, but they will say \"kya kar sakte hain\"? Like hum hi kar sakte hain. We can do it. Atleast we can request the Govt. to help them out. \n\nNow the question arises \"hum kya koi minister hain jo govt ake humara baat sunega?\" Nope you are not that I know.\n\nBut you people are using social medias right. Try to share the problem in social media. It might help them you never know.\n\nBro! Tum log Binod ka naam use krke usko famous kar sakte ho, lekin ek middle class family jo log suffer kar rahe hain can't you just share up their problems in the social media to just create an awareness?! \n\nDo give a read.\nDrop down your opinions.\nSuggest something that we can do to help them out.\n\n@narendramodi  @naveen_odisha \n\n#awareness \n#pandemic2020 \n#helping_hands","NumberOfLikes":74,"Hashtags":["#awareness","#pandemic2020","#helping_hands"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Naksh's inküíú on August 16, 2020.
