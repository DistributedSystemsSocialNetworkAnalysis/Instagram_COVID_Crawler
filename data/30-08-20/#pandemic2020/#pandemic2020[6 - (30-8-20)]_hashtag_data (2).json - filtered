These are lightweight, double layered cotton just like my regular masks but they are built with darts that make them stand out from your nose and mouth, making breathing easier (swipe right to see a profile view).\n\nThese have a really nice fit and unlike other \"duck bill\" type masks I've added a nose wire for an exceptional fit around the nose. No foggy glasses here!\n\nAfter reading a study that showed that knit fabrics not only don't stop droplets, they actually break them up into a finer aerosol that are even worse than wearing no mask at all, I wanted to provide a good, breathable, but woven cotton option to give you the ultimate in safety.\n\nI've also modified this pattern, which originally had an open seam on the inside, making it virtually only one layer thick right in front of your mouth.

We also live on the rim of a 800' gorge, 50 miles long, that runs through volcanic basalt. Deep in the narrow gorge, the Rio Grande flushes through with Class IV white water rapids. In ten minutes, we can drive down a deathly, curvaceous, narrow, washboard-ridden road and swim in the river's wider current, float a tube across it's gurgling belly. In 20 minutes, we can hike along a flowing mountain stream, carrying snow melt down from New Mexico's highest peak, Wheeler.\n\nBut up here on Taos's West Mesa, there's no water. That's why we have cisterns. Being the fancy dirt folk that we are, we got two of them, 1600 gallons each, probably 6-8 weeks worth with our indoor shower and washing machine going regularly. Soon, we'll have gutters to collect rain during the wild storm ambushes that gather over us once in a while. This year, the monsoons were already late and I heard friends who normally live off rain collection asking the phone number for the water delivery truck.\n\nThere is a community well down the road, which was installed only a few years back, just as the road was recently paved a few years before that. With a membership, you can drive your water containers over there to be filled. Perhaps one day that will seem like a necessary expense.\n\nToday, we have a five gallon jug perched over our sink that we usually use for camping. Fortunately, we had kept it filled due to the current pandemic. We await the water truck while our sink fills with dirty dishes.\nRead more in blog...link in bio...\n.\n.\n.\n#watercatchment #waterislife #waterconservation #watercollection #offgridbuilding #offgrid #offgridhome #offgridliving #sustainableliving #conservation #climatechange #environmentalism #writinglife #writersblog #pandemic2020 #shelterinplace","NumberOfLikes":18,"Hashtags":["#watercatchment","#waterislife","#waterconservation","#watercollection","#offgridbuilding","#offgrid","#offgridhome","#offgridliving","#sustainableliving","#conservation","#climatechange","#environmentalism","#writinglife","#writersblog","#pandemic2020","#shelterinplace"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Johanna DeBiase in Taos County, New Mexico.

Those suggestions include making coronavirus tests broadly accessible, and free. He has said there should be no out-of-pocket cost for patients to receive an eventual vaccine, either. And he has been sharply critical of President Trump\u2019s response to the virus, accusing him of reacting too slowly.\n\nMr. Biden served as vice president in the Obama administration during the passage of the Affordable Care Act, and health care remains a top priority for him. It\u2019s an issue he often discusses in the context of his family\u2019s personal tragedies: He lost his first wife and an infant daughter in a car accident in 1972, and in 2015, his son Beau Biden died of brain cancer. Health care, he said in an early television ad, is \u201Cpersonal\u201D to him. He supports adding a public option to the Affordable Care Act, but opposes \u201CMedicare for all,\u201D the sweeping single-payer measure advocated by some progressives in his party, including Senator Bernie Sanders.\n\nMr. Biden, who served for decades in the Senate, firmly believes in the value of bipartisanship and insists on extending overtures to Republicans even in a moment when many in his own party don\u2019t see negotiating partners on the other side. As a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he also speaks passionately about asserting and defending America\u2019s role as a leader on the global stage.\n\nSource: @nytimes #NYtimes\n#Connecticut #CT #PrimaryElection #August2020 #GeneralElection #November2020 #Democrat #Democrats #DemocraticParty #CTdems #JoeBiden #KamalaHarris #WhiteHouse #Politics #UnitedStates #Election2020 #ElectionDay #Vote #Vote2020 #CTvote2020 #RegisterToVote #VoteByMail #2020 #AbsenteeBallot #BLM #BlackLivesMatter #COVID19 #Coronavirus #Pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":15,"Hashtags":["#NYtimes","#Connecticut","#CT","#PrimaryElection","#August2020","#GeneralElection","#November2020","#Democrat","#Democrats","#DemocraticParty","#CTdems","#JoeBiden","#KamalaHarris","#WhiteHouse","#Politics","#UnitedStates","#Election2020","#ElectionDay","#Vote","#Vote2020","#CTvote2020","#RegisterToVote","#VoteByMail","#2020","#AbsenteeBallot","#BLM","#BlackLivesMatter","#COVID19","#Coronavirus","#Pandemic2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by CT Vote 2020 in East Hartford, Connecticut.

As schools get ready to re-open in September after a long quarantine break, this has been a very difficult time and a confusing decision to make for parents. \n\nI met my neighbor yesterday and she asked me what I was planning to do. When I told her, she felt so re-assured that she had someone who had decided the same as her. \n\nI think in these confusing times, every parent wants that support and re-assurance about the decision that they have made. But everyone cannot have the same decision. Everyone has different age kids, different work circumstances and different set of issues leading upto that decision. While, it\u2019s an ongoing decision about what\u2019s the right thing to do, I don\u2019t think there is one right answer for anyone and I want to tell all parents that whatever decision you have taken today, it\u2019s the right one for you and your family and you have done the right thing for your kids and they will be okay as long as you support them throughout this phase whether they are at home or at school üòä\n\nAs for me, my kids will be going back to school in September and the most important part in this decision was taking the kids opinions in consideration and they both are very comfortable with the idea of going back to school üíñ\n\nIf anyone is having a hard time thinking about this confusion situation you can always dm me.

Their careers were expanding and all was looking bright. .\n. \n. \nWe were delighted at the beginning of this year to hear from them asking for our help again!

We were getting them ready to list and to home shop. Then, BAM! A pandemic hit... A quarantine happened. .\n. \n. \nWhat a roller coaster ride to get from point A to point B. Listing virtually. Showing virtually. Home shopping virtually. What a stressful experience for the kids. .\n. \n. \nEven once everything was under contract, then getting it closed safely and smoothly was not easy. We are grateful everything came together. And this beautiful family is now happily settled into their new home! .\n. \n. \nPlease take a moment to help me congratulate them! They deserve a medal!

In the past, some epidemics and pandemics have been found to be associated with varying levels of bacterial\/fungal co-infections, which are a major cause of mortality. For example, data suggests that co-infection is associated with more severe outcomes in seasonal and pandemic influenza and may account for up to 30% of cases of Community Acquired Pneumonia. \nStudies have shown that antibiotics are being administered to a majority of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. While this protocol may be justified in light of the history of pandemic co-infections, there are also increasing concerns about the growing incidence of antibiotic resistance.  Therefore, researchers identified \u201Ca clinical need for robust investigation into co-infection in patients with COVID-19.2\nIn a systematic review and meta-analysis researchers evaluated thirty studies encompassing 3,834 patients hospitalized for COVID-19.  Results showed that patients in ICU wards had a higher proportion of bacterial co-infection than patients in ICU\/mixed ward settings. The overall incidence of bacterial co-infection in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was 7%, while in studies that included only ICU patients the incidence was 14%. Other authors have estimated the overall incidence of secondary infection in COVID-19 patients to be between 10-30% of cases.2 The most common bacterial pathogens identified by this review are Mycoplasma pneumonia followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. \nThe prevalence of viral co-infections was 3%, with influenza A and Respiratory Syncytial Virus occurring most frequently. Co-infection with fungal pathogens was reported in only three of the studies included in this review. However, an increasing number of reports from Europe of COVID-19 patients with possible or probable pulmonary aspergillosis, suggests that further investigation into co-infection with fungal pathogens is warranted.","NumberOfLikes":14,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Desbio Seminars on August 14, 2020.

Parents only see what is RECOMMENDED in the news media. They have not received any detailed information from their district on precisely what WILL AND WILL NOT OCCUR with regard to transportation in their district. This is the most comprehensive written information that I have been able to find on Transportation.  If your district is using this great and if they are not feel free to provide this to them as a recommendation.\n\nThe only concern that I have with regard to this is that illistration for seating arrangements without masks alludes to the thought that the wearing of a mask somehow allows social distancing grace. The CDC recommendations do not define hand washing, the where of a mask, and social distancing as interchangeable protective measures. You cannot excuse yourself from wearing a mask just because you decide to wash your hands frequently. You cannot excuse yourself from social distancing just because you've decided to wear a mask. That said, transportation needs to re-assess proposed seating arrangements.\n\nParents please stay informed and be vigilant.
