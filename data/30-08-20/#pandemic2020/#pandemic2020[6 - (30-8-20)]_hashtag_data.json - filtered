Built in 1953, the green, retro, Art Deco building looks much the same as it did onscreen. It\u2019s located at \u202A1830 Winona Boulevard\u202C in the Los Feliz area of Los Angeles. Please note that this is a private residence so if you visit please do not trespass or disturb the people that live there.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t seen this popular series yet, it basically gives viewers an insight into the mind of Joe, who is stalking the women he loves. Based on a series of novels, the second season is loosely based on the novel \u201CHidden Bodies\u201D by Caroline Kepnes - which picks up with Joe where the first season left off. That\u2019s all I\u2019ll say. I don\u2019t want to give any spoilers for those if you who haven\u2019t seen the series yet. \n\nGood news for fans of the show...an official return date hasn't been announced just yet, but Netflix has renewed the series for a third season!\n\nFun facts - It's hard to imagine anyone else playing Joe, but Penn Badgley was unsure about taking the role at first.  In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said he was \"conflicted\" about the part, largely because the show is framed as a love story. \"If this is a love story, what is it saying?\" he said. Ultimately, discussions with showrunners convinced him to take the part. \n\nDue to the fact that most of Joe\u2019s lines are actually voiceover, Penn said that most days he wouldn't have much dialogue to actually memorize. In fact, Penn\u2019s first acting jobs were doing voiceovers for a radio station and Nintendo 64 video games when he was only 10 years old.  #filminglocation #losfeliz #younetflix #pennbadgley #hollywoodtour #pandemic2020 #socialdistancing #wearamask #tonymiros @younetflix","NumberOfLikes":47,"Hashtags":["#filminglocation","#losfeliz","#younetflix","#pennbadgley","#hollywoodtour","#pandemic2020","#socialdistancing","#wearamask","#tonymiros"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1597598564,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 16 19:22:44 CEST 2020","Location":"Los Feliz\/ Hollywood Hills"},{"CaptionText":"Umm can we talk about that freak thunderstorm we just had!!?!

If the virus had been genetically engineered in a lab there would be signs of manipulation in the genome data.\n\nThis would include evidence of an existing viral sequence as the backbone for the new virus, and obvious, targeted inserted (or deleted) genetic elements.\nBut no such evidence exists. It is very unlikely that any techniques used to genetically engineer the virus would not leave a genetic signature, like specific identifiable pieces of DNA code.\n\nThe genome of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of other bat coronaviruses, as well as those of pangolins, all of which have a similar overall genomic architecture. Differences between the genomes of these coronaviruses show natural patterns typical of coronavirus evolution. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 evolved from a previous wild coronavirus.\n\n Some scientists have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may have come from another known bat virus (RaTG13) found by researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The genomes of these two viruses are 96% similar to one another.\n\nThis might sound very close but in evolutionary terms this actually makes them significantly different and the two have been shown to share a common ancestor. This shows that RaGT13 is not the ancestor of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nIn fact, SARS-CoV-2 most likely evolved from a viral variant that couldn't survive for a long period of time or that persists at low levels in bats.\n\n#bats #batvirus #pandemic #pandemic2020 #virus2020 #virus #covid #covid19 #scientist #sci #pharmsci #pharmacyblog #pharmacyawarness #pharmacist #pharmaclass #sarscov2 #sars #epidemic","NumberOfLikes":16,"Hashtags":["#bats","#batvirus","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#virus2020","#virus","#covid","#covid19","#scientist","#sci","#pharmsci","#pharmacyblog","#pharmacyawarness","#pharmacist","#pharmaclass","#sarscov2","#sars","#epidemic"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597591789,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 16 17:29:49 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Pandemic day154: Mini cheddar bay biscuits #cheddarbaybiscuits #biscuits #alexcooksyum #pandemicbaking #pandemic2020 #breadtime","NumberOfLikes":14,"Hashtags":["#cheddarbaybiscuits","#biscuits","#alexcooksyum","#pandemicbaking","#pandemic2020","#breadtime"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Alexandra Burke on August 16, 2020.

They said stay home.  They said wash your hands.  They said two weeks.  That was FIVE MONTHS AGO.  Why is this still going on?  Because we didn\u2019t stay home.  We went to Target We went to Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s (in droves). We went to curbside restaurants.  We went to drive throughs. We went to liquor stores.  We went to pools and parties.  We did not stay home.  And we wonder why we are still in the thick of it.  This is not Trump\u2019s fault.  This is not Fauci\u2019s fault.  This is not a Democrat or Republican issue.  This is an AMERICAN issue.  We decided that we are going to do what we wanted to do and that\u2019s that. \nBefore you blame anyone, ask yourself how many times in March, April, May, June, and July (before the mask mandate) did you go out?

Toss in your ear buds and listen to your favorite podcast as you're out and about today. Begin journaling once a day to sit with your thoughts.\n\nSelf-care as an extrovert: Enroll in a weekly exercise class that you enjoy, find a local cause you feel pulled to volunteer for, create a standing coffee or dinner date with your friends that happens weekly, or join a book club.\n\nWhatever side of the spectrum you're on, make sure you take care of you in the unique way you're made to be taken care of.","NumberOfLikes":2,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Gwyn Morasko on August 15, 2020.

Scientists suspect that they contracted the virus by eating or touching an animal who was infected.\n_\nThis is yet another reason why we should all be #vegan.\n_\nIt's bad enough that the consumption of #meat and other animal-based foods contributes to #heartdisease, #diabetes and #cancer, and that harmful bacteria found in the intestines and faeces of #animals, including salmonella and E coli, often cause outbreaks of food poisoning. Do we really want to add more deadly animal-borne diseases into the mix?\n_\nMany devastating disease outbreaks come about because humans house animals in filthy, severely crowded farms and markets \u2013 breeding grounds for pathogens \u2013 in order to satisfy their meat habits.\n_\nIt's not at all unusual for viruses and other pathogens to jump from animals into the human population. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 75% of emerging infectious diseases originate in animals. Kevin Olival, a disease ecologist and conservationist at EcoHealth Alliance, says, \"When you bring animals together in \u2026 unnatural situations, you have the risk of human diseases emerging.\" In other words, many devastating disease outbreaks come about because humans house animals in filthy, severely crowded farms and markets \u2013 breeding grounds for pathogens \u2013 in order to satisfy their meat habit.\n_\n#rethink #govegan #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife #pandemic #covid19 #govegan #veganism #tryit #animallover #dogs #cats #puppy #kitt","NumberOfLikes":7,"Hashtags":["#Repost","#COVID-19","#vegan.","#meat","#heartdisease,","#diabetes","#cancer,","#animals,","#rethink","#govegan","#pandemic2020","#pandemiclife","#pandemic","#covid19","#govegan","#veganism","#tryit","#animallover","#dogs","#cats","#puppy","#kitt"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597538378,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 16 02:39:38 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#arte #covid_19 #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife😷","NumberOfLikes":7,"Hashtags":["#arte","#covid_19","#pandemic2020","#pandemiclife😷"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Lorena Bazalar on August 15, 2020.

Someone's words or actions, shouldn't be the reason for anything in your life. 🤗\n\n5- Some pauses are a gift. 2020 is one of them! You use it, or you loose it, that's totally in your hands. 🤞\n\n6- Once you really stop rushing through life, you will grow fond of it & realize how much time, life has to offer ✨\nPhoto: By my favorite @lookdoyousee ✨","NumberOfLikes":41,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Ananya Rijhwani in Goa, India with @lookdoyousee, and @ananyarijhwani.weddings.

Today\u2019s stop is the front of the same high school where literally every movie and tv show you\u2019ve ever seen was filmed! \n\nDesigned by architect George M. Lindsey in the Collegiate Gothic style, and constructed in 1930, John Marshall High School is located at \u202A3939 Tracy St., Los Feliz \u202C. Please note that this is a public school so if you decide to visit it please do not trespass or disturb anybody working or attending school there.\n\nThe school is popular among filmmakers for its gothic architecture, which lends itself to double as a school that can be located in any number of places around the country. For example Tom Hanks drove a bus for John Marshall students in \u201CBachelor Party\u201D, Luke Perry and Kristie Swanson attended school there in the \u201CBuffy the Vampire Slayer\u201D movie, it was a religious academy in the Sarah Jessica Parker-Helen Hunt comedy \u201CGirls Just Wanna Have Fun\u201D, it stood in for Dewey High on \u201CGrowing Pains\u201D  and John Adams High on \u201CBoy Meets World\u201D, and the site of the therapy session between Dr. Evil and his son in \u201CAustin Powers 2.\u201D \n\nThere have also been a slew of famous people that went to school here including actor Leonardo DiCaprio, NFL Hall of Fame player Mike Haynes, Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss, actress Julie Newmar, known for her role as Catwoman in the television series Batman, singer and member of the 1960s singing group The Mamas and the Papas Michelle Phillips, and vocalist, producer and songwriter for The Black Eyed Peas will.i.am! \n\nFun facts - While it\u2019s set in the Chicago suburbs, \u201CPretty in Pink\u201D (1986), was actually filmed in LA. John Marshall\u2019s red-brick facade practically screams \u201CMidwest educational institution,\u201D making it an obvious stand-in for Andie's (Molly Ringwald) Illinois high school.\n\nThe school\u2019s front entrance also gets a bit of screen time, as does the old library, in the music video for Van Halen's \u201CHot for Teacher\u201D! \n #filminglocation #losfeliz #johnmarshallhighschool #hollywoodtour #pandemic2020 #socialdistancing #wearamask #tonymiros","NumberOfLikes":53,"Hashtags":["#filminglocation","#losfeliz","#johnmarshallhighschool","#hollywoodtour","#pandemic2020","#socialdistancing","#wearamask","#tonymiros"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1597514529,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 20:02:09 CEST 2020","Location":"John Marshall High School (Los Angeles)"},{"CaptionText":"I ain't going to live forever\nI just want to live while i'm alive...\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n. \n🎤#Itsmylife\n #alive #summerdays #summer2020 #😷 #pandemic2020\n#nature #tapatias #fresh #free #imalive","NumberOfLikes":30,"Hashtags":["#Itsmylife","#alive","#summerdays","#summer2020","#😷","#pandemic2020","#nature","#tapatias","#fresh","#free","#imalive"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by KAREN in Parque Metropolitano de Guadalajara (OFICIAL).

I broke down racial injustice, from buying a bag of skittles to jogging for your health and well being... I fully broke down the aspects of the world we live in today.

I was sitting at my kitchen table and the sun was shining perfectly through the blinds. I was sad. I was lonely. I was suffering from panic attacks which I had never experienced before. My relationship had just ended and I was struggling and still am. I didn\u2019t have the support from my friends that I wanted (the physical support) due to the pandemic so I was physically alone. I had this huge feeling of emptiness. I wasn\u2019t eating or sleeping well. I knew these feelings would be temporary or at least I hoped they would be. So I decided to pack up and go see family for much needed support. I\u2019m so glad I did because it has helped tremendously. \n\u2022\nThe pandemic in itself has caused a lot of confusion and pain for people. Add on the racial and political climate to make you feel even more confused and sad. I\u2019m still sad. I still struggle daily with what\u2019s going on in my life and the world around me. Every day I feel better. Every day is a little brighter. I recognize my feelings. I recognize the blessings I have. I recognize the exciting bright future I have ahead. \n\u2022\nOpening up even a little bit about my feelings is very hard for me. Therapy has been a huge help for me over the years and recent weeks to get more in tune with my true self. It\u2019s been challenging, frustrating, sad, exciting, and rewarding. It\u2019s a work in progress. WE are a work in progress.

Never in a million years did I think getting a mask 😷, and checking daily temp would be part of the back to school list. This year has left me scratching my head on many occasions. The school Bailey goes to handled it very well. There was so much excitement on property! The teachers were genuinely excited to see all the kids. They made it a very special time for kids and parents. They helped lighten the load of the \u201Cshock factor\u201D of showing up to school with everyone in masks and all the different precautions in place. I am grateful that they chose to open her school. \n\nI also continue to be amazed watching my friends who are homeschooling their children. Talk about rising to the occasion and making the best of it. I have seen makeshift home classrooms(super cool by the way), activity centers, daily schedules, and most of all I\u2019ve seen parents connecting with other parents. I know these parents are being hard on themselves and going a little crazy, but please know you are doing AMAZING!! I have so much respect and admiration for you. \n\nOn a side note my heart is full seeing just how capable each of us are. It amazes me to see how we can adapt in hopes of making a better future for our children. While we may not agree with everything, for me personally I don\u2019t agree with a lot, but it\u2019s important that we continue to do and be our best for our kids and our future. Even if there are things that seem out of our control, what we choose to do within our own home could be what makes a lasting difference. There are so many of you that I\u2019ve connected with during this crazy time. I am so grateful for the connection and friendships that have come from this. I hope y\u2019all have a great weekend! \n\n#blogger #nashvilleblogger #vlogger #nashvillevlogger #backtoschool #backtoschool2020 #homeschool #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife #riseuptogether #riseabove #future #school #saturdaymood #family #friends #familyofinstagram #2020","NumberOfLikes":310,"Hashtags":["#blogger","#nashvilleblogger","#vlogger","#nashvillevlogger","#backtoschool","#backtoschool2020","#homeschool","#pandemic2020","#pandemiclife","#riseuptogether","#riseabove","#future","#school","#saturdaymood","#family","#friends","#familyofinstagram","#2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":13,"Timestamp":1597501463,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 16:24:23 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Different sizes dispensers available..\n\n1 246 831 1061 or 1 246 546 4707 \n\n#pandemic2020 #covid19 #sanitizer #clean","NumberOfLikes":1,"Hashtags":["#pandemic2020","#covid19","#sanitizer","#clean"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597501440,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 16:24:00 CEST 2020","Location":"Christ Church, Barbados"},{"CaptionText":"A message from @ankitadave_1 😇🇮🇳\n.\n.\n.\nFollow @xappie.bollywood \n\n#AnkitaDave #bollywood #actress #happyindependenceday #covid19 #staysafe #stayhygiene #pandemic2020 #hindiactress #bollywoodindustry #hindifilms #actresslife #messagetoall #independence2020 #hindifilmindustry #xappiebollywood","NumberOfLikes":8,"Hashtags":["#AnkitaDave","#bollywood","#actress","#happyindependenceday","#covid19","#staysafe","#stayhygiene","#pandemic2020","#hindiactress","#bollywoodindustry","#hindifilms","#actresslife","#messagetoall","#independence2020","#hindifilmindustry","#xappiebollywood"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Xappie on August 15, 2020 tagging @ankitadave_1.

Previously I read an anthology of poetry and loved it. This is an anthology of letters and I knew I had to make it mine as soon as I lay eyes on it. It's beautiful to say the least.\n\n#bookreview👇\n\n\"You never came to stay; you never left to return. I never loved to un-love you, and that is the tragedy of my ordinary life.\"\n\n'With Love' is a collection of letters, each very deep and special in its own way. There's a longing for lost love and friendship. There are letters that talk of estranged relationships, and others which speak of people who you felt the closest to not having enough time for you. And then, there are letters which are ambiguous and reading through them you can't figure out who's written them to whom unless you reach the very end. These letters make you raise some very important questions, questions which you try answering but can't. \n\nThere were letters which made me smile, others which made me cry, a few which reminded me of people who have been a part of my life in the past and others that I have loved. There were a few that made me keep the book down and made me sympathise with people who have lived through tragedies. There are letters that talk about ends and others about beginnings. Some about heartbreaks, others about hope. Some about love and others about fear. \n\nA letter made me raise a very important question which was- How do you decide it's time to leave a friendship, a relationship, even a marriage?\nThere was one letter in particular which made me realise how we often contemplate things and don't do them and regret it later. And one made me think how we feel stupid for our actions when in reality all they are is cute. \n\nAll in all this anthology of letters was full of realisations for me. It evoked feelings that I didn't know existed within me. It brought about a flurry of emotions and I was forced to sit back and reflect and give myself closure on things that lie there hanging. It was a book which proved helpful to me in a way no one ever has.\n\nRead it to feel things. Read it to reminisce a beautiful past and be assured that a great future lies ahead.","NumberOfLikes":346,"Hashtags":["#qotd-","#bookreview👇"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by JAPNEET\u2022BOOKSTAGRAM\u2022IN 🇮🇳 in Delhi, India with @booknerdparadise, @booksparks, @penguinindia, @ttt_official, @penguinbooks, @flatlay_gallery, @flatlay, @theb00kstagram, @flatlayindia, @ig.reads, @igreadsindia, @mybookfeatures, @midlandbooksofficial, @bookishladiesclub, @flatlaysquad, @bookishfeatures_, @perksofbookstagram, @bookreviewfeatures, and @flatlayphotographers.","NumberOfComments":57,"Timestamp":1597491616,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 13:40:16 CEST 2020","Location":"Delhi, India"},{"CaptionText":"Help, I got \"Pussy Monster\" by Lil Wayne stuck in my head and it won't go away 🥴 #ButFirstASelfie #SelfiesForSelfLove #SelfieNation #SelfieGram #PhotoOfTheDay #Quarantine #Pandemic #Pandemic2020 #Coronavirus #Covid #Covid19 #Kawaii #KawaiiGirl #KawaiiGoth #BubbleGoth #PastelGoth #PastelGrunge #AltGirl #AltGirls #AlternativeGirl #AlternativeGirls #Thicc #ThickChick #NewHair #DyedHair","NumberOfLikes":18,"Hashtags":["#ButFirstASelfie","#SelfiesForSelfLove","#SelfieNation","#SelfieGram","#PhotoOfTheDay","#Quarantine","#Pandemic","#Pandemic2020","#Coronavirus","#Covid","#Covid19","#Kawaii","#KawaiiGirl","#KawaiiGoth","#BubbleGoth","#PastelGoth","#PastelGrunge","#AltGirl","#AltGirls","#AlternativeGirl","#AlternativeGirls","#Thicc","#ThickChick","#NewHair","#DyedHair"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by 🍭🦄 UnicornPlushy 🦄🍭 on August 15, 2020.

Our death count is now at 21. Cases, albeit slower than before, are still surfacing.\u2063\n\u2063\nAs per my last update, I\u2019m leaning into the narratives and stories that occupy my headspace.\u2063\n\u2063\nSome days there is insurmountable self-doubt, insecurities, anxiety, fear of not helping, not making a difference, not being heard, being a failure, imposter syndrome, and extreme sadness at the world we live in and the injustices all around us. \u2063\n\u2063\nSome of these insecurities stem from social and cultural conditioning of what is deemed 'successful\u2019 at my age. No house, no kids, no fancy car, no esteemed career, etc. After reflecting, I\u2019ve realised that I have consciously traded in crippling debt and security for freedom.\u2063\n\u2063\nOther days I\u2019m overcome with gratitude and love for my life, my friends, my family, the journey I\u2019m on, and the self-awareness that comes with deep healing from previous relationships, and childhood trauma.\u2063\n\u2063\nOften, I find myself wanting to rush the journey. To be 'healed' and \u2018fixed\u2019 and get to all the juicy stuff on the other side. Then I pause, and remember, there is no other side. This is a committed practice of mindfulness, awareness, self-love, empathy, and compassion. \u2063🥰\n\u2063\nYou can\u2019t find happiness outside of yourself. And, you have to go through shit to find the answers. These answers raise more questions, and the cycle begins again.\u2063 💓\n\u2063\nIt took a lot of courage to share this today, my finger has been hovering over the post button for a weirdly long time.

It\u2019s FRUSTRATING. However, we can\u2019t dwell on that. I knew that I could NOT just be miserable for HOWEVER LONG this takes. We have to make do with what we have. We have to be THANKFUL for what we STILL have. Sure, we might not have the typical opportunities with friends and family and life, but we can still figure something out. School, shopping, going to work and everything else- different. However, there is ALWAYS something we can do. Don\u2019t give up ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ #ronenrubinsteinedit #ronenrubinstein #suicidepreventionawareness #suicideprevention #2020 #dobetterbebetter #striveforgreatness  #weareallinthistogether #tkstrand #carlosreyes #positivity #covid19 #pandemic2020 #2020gonewrong #findthegood","NumberOfLikes":4,"Hashtags":["#ronenrubinsteinedit","#ronenrubinstein","#suicidepreventionawareness","#suicideprevention","#2020","#dobetterbebetter","#striveforgreatness","#weareallinthistogether","#tkstrand","#carlosreyes","#positivity","#covid19","#pandemic2020","#2020gonewrong","#findthegood"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597467869,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 15 07:04:29 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Hai Sobat Mindok 🤗❤️\nMemasuki fase new normal,mindok mau kasih tau nihh perlengkapan yang wajib dibawa saat bepergian di tengah pandemi.\n.\nRibett sih,tapi apasih yang enggak buat keselamatan dan kesehatan😉.New normal,new habits.\n.\nSelalu jaga kesehatan yaa Sobat Mindokk,dan jangan lupa buat order Odoken hihihi🤭\n.\n#odoken #popdoken #newnormal #pandemic2020 #covid19 #kulinertasikmalaya #jajanankekinian #jajanantasik #tasikmalaya #donatkentang","NumberOfLikes":6,"Hashtags":["#odoken","#popdoken","#newnormal","#pandemic2020","#covid19","#kulinertasikmalaya","#jajanankekinian","#jajanantasik","#tasikmalaya","#donatkentang"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Donat Kentang O'Doken on August 14, 2020 tagging @duta.bakso.tasikmalaya, @baranghakanday, @enjoytasik, @wisatakulinertasikmalaya, @tasikfoodsociety, and @foodhuntertasikmalaya.

As schools get ready to re-open in September after a long quarantine break, this has been a very difficult time and a confusing decision to make for parents. \n\nI met my neighbor yesterday and she asked me what I was planning to do. When I told her, she felt so re-assured that she had someone who had decided the same as her. \n\nI think in these confusing times, every parent wants that support and re-assurance about the decision that they have made. But everyone cannot have the same decision. Everyone has different age kids, different work circumstances and different set of issues leading upto that decision. While, it\u2019s an ongoing decision about what\u2019s the right thing to do, I don\u2019t think there is one right answer for anyone and I want to tell all parents that whatever decision you have taken today, it\u2019s the right one for you and your family and you have done the right thing for your kids and they will be okay as long as you support them throughout this phase whether they are at home or at school 😊\n\nAs for me, my kids will be going back to school in September and the most important part in this decision was taking the kids opinions in consideration and they both are very comfortable with the idea of going back to school 💖\n\nIf anyone is having a hard time thinking about this confusion situation you can always dm me.

Let\u2019s be honest, life is messy and chaotic, and it\u2019s wasn\u2019t going to be long before my grid went back to reflecting that!\n\nOn a more serious note, I have noticed that there is lots of excitement about the possibility of racing staring again, and I\u2019ve seen lots of people posting about eating out to help out.\n\nI am also aware through my clinical work, and other conversations that a lot of people are struggling more with the easing of lockdown than they did with suddenly being thrown in to lockdown.\n\nThere is so much uncertainty around right now. We are watching the number of cases start to rise again around the world,  holiday plans being thrown in to chaos again, local lockdowns being put in place, and ultimately fearing that we too are going to end up back in lockdown again.\n\nThe pandemic hasn\u2019t gone away. We are still in the midst of a global trauma, so the threat is still very much there. On top of that the easings and advice we have been getting is very confusing, adding to the feelings of anxiety.\n\nAs a result, many of us are still feeling very on edge, and understandably struggling to take advantage of these new found freedoms.\n\nSo I want to say, that while you may be looking on social media, feeling like you are the only one feeling this way, you are not. In fact, given the situation, it is a completely understandable response. I also want you to know that how someone presents themselves on social media may not be how they are really feeling inside.\n\nHow you are feeling is absolutely valid.\n\n#therapistsofinstagram #mentalwellbeing #motherrunner #maternalmentalhealth #runningismytherapy #heatwave #icecreamcone #toohotoutside #postpartumfitness #psychology #pandemic2020 #lockdownlife #anxiety #mentalhealthawareness #socialmediaisnotreallife #anxietyawareness #itsoknottobeok","NumberOfLikes":118,"Hashtags":["#therapistsofinstagram","#mentalwellbeing","#motherrunner","#maternalmentalhealth","#runningismytherapy","#heatwave","#icecreamcone","#toohotoutside","#postpartumfitness","#psychology","#pandemic2020","#lockdownlife","#anxiety","#mentalhealthawareness","#socialmediaisnotreallife","#anxietyawareness","#itsoknottobeok"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Chloe on August 14, 2020.

And one of my favorite parts is the Rydell Graduation Carnival at the end of the movie. So for today\u2019s stop on my pandemic Hollywood tour we\u2019re visiting the football field where this classic movie musical was filmed! \n\nThe carnival scene was shot in the summer of 1977, toward the end of filming, at the football field of John Marshall High School located at \u202A3939 Tracy St., Los Feliz \u202C (as one of three schools that stood in for the fictional Rydell High). The field is situated downhill from the main school building and has a panoramic view of the Hollywood Hills and the surrounding neighborhood.\n\nPlease note that this is a public school so if you decide to visit it please do not trespass or disturb anybody working or attending school there.\n\nIf you want to see the school they used for the front of Rydell High (aka Venice High School) check out my post from June 12th.\n\nFun facts - The cast had been rehearsing the final number for weeks, but didn\u2019t realize until they arrived on set that producer Allan Carr had rented an actual, fully-operational carnival.\n\nOlivia Newton-John's pants were so tight when filming \"You're the One That I Want,\" that she had to be sewn into them. \"They sewed me into those pants every morning for a week,\" Newton-John said. \"Believe me, I had to be very careful about what I ate and drank. It was excruciating.\" It was 106 degrees on the set for the carnival finale.\n\nThe song \u201CYou\u2019re the One That I Want,\u201D was a last-minute replacement for \u201CAll Choked Up,\u201D the homage to Elvis Presley\u2019s \u201CAll Shook Up\u201D that ended the stage play. The number was played for most of the cast on the day they shot it, and quickly staged by choreographer Pat Birch in the carnival\u2019s fun house. \n\nThe musical number, \u201CWe Go Together,\u201D featured Birch\u2019s ensemble of 20 professional dancers and a chorus of Rydell students, all making a mad dash across the football field while singing and dancing in the extreme heat.

Recently in the SF Bay Area, UCSF injected a COVID-19 patient with the two-drug combo. \u2063\n\u2063\nThe 1,000 or so patients in the study will all be given a Remdesivir infusion. Half will also be injected with interferon, while the other half will get a placebo. The patients will receive the combo every other day for four doses.  The researchers will then study how the patients in each group react over time. \u2063\n\u2063\nWhy this combo? Remdesivir has shown to shorten recovery times among COVID-19 patients. As for interferon, a recent UK study found that hospitalized COVID-19 patients who received an inhaled form of interferon beta fared better. These patients had a 79% lower risk of developing more debilitating symptoms, decrease in both fatalities and the number of patients on breathing tubes compared to people on a placebo. \u2063\n \u2063\nResearchers hope Remdesivir will attack the virus while inhaled interferon will lower inflammation. Together, the two drugs may be able to decrease hospitalizations, decrease need for breathing tubes and decrease deaths. In fact if the two-drug combo is successful, researchers hope to use it as an outpatient treatment to prevent hospitalizations. NIH said preliminary results are expected in the fall. \u2063\n\u2063\nClinical trials likes these are examples of the different ways scientist are actively looking for definitive treatment for COVID-19. They offer more incentive to intensify the search for more effective treatments. \u2063\n\u2063\nHang in there my friends. We are getting through this one day at a time. More importantly, keep the hope alive. \u2063\n\u2063\nHave an amazing weekend! Do you have any questions?

Droplets where you can find corona virus! The amount of infected and asymptomatic people is high and lots can spread the virus without knowing they are doing so, which may lead to the death of someone who is more vulnerable to the virus or unlucky enough to get symptoms.\n\nA recent study coming from Duke, looked at the efficacy of different types of masks at  lowering the spread of droplets. They concluded that N95s and surgical masks were the most effective, but that cloth masks other than those made out of fleece, or bandanas were still very good at preventing the spread of droplets!\n\nOther countries who have been compliant with measure have been able to reduce the caseload enough to inch closer to the old normal. \n\nLet\u2019s work together to get there and wear a mask! \n\nReferences\/ Referencias:\n\nFischer, E.

Not that anyone needs to give a reason as to why they choose to do something, but it is 100% the right choice for our family at this point. \u2063\n\u2063\nThis is what a typical conversation sounds like lately.\u2063\n\u2063\nQ: Why do you want to send them back to school?\u2063\n\u2063\nA: They need to be at school. We struggled a lot with online learning in the spring and know that Isla will do much better and thrive in a school environment again. Nash too is also so excited to start JK and we want him to experience it no matter what it looks like.\u2063\n\u2063\nQ: Are you not worried about the long term affects and what they will feel seeing everyone in masks and gloves all the time?\u2063\n\u2063\nA: No. I am worried about the long term affects of NOT going back to school. As for masks, in 10 years from now we will talk and my kids will say \u201Cremember that time we had to go back to school and wear masks? That was crazy eh?\u201D I don\u2019t feel like having to wear masks and seeing people wear masks will cause them future struggles, IMO.\n\u2063\nQ: Are you not scared of everything that could happen?\u2063\n\u2063\nA: When the whole pandemic started, I chose not to live in fear. Fear gets you nowhere, fast. We respect what\u2019s happening, take the proper precautions and have instilled all of those things with our kids including the importance of hand washing, distancing and masks. I have to be confident that other people will be doing the same and that the schools have everyones safety as their first priority.\u2063\n\u2063\nAll of this being said, if things take a drastic turn, or the school year starts and I am less than impressed about how things are going down, we may change how we are doing things. But, for now, the kids will be getting on that school bus with their labelled matching masks in September. \u2063\n\u2063\nWhatever you are choosing to do this school year, you have made the right choice for you and your family.

Lemonade doesn't work for me, but a mandala does. The past few days have been a bit of a drab. The new normal is changing our lives, and it's so hard to accept it. And what does the \"new normal\" really mean when there's nothing normal about it. So widespread is this virus that even forest tales speak of it. Some of us will adapt to the change, while some of us will have their lives changed forever. I still don't know where I stand with it, but I do feel the change a little every day. Found some storm fallen lemons on my walk this morning. They seem to have fallen a while back and almost out of juice, but I couldn't give up on their vibrant color. How strong-spirited are these lemons that they radiate the last of their lovely color and fragrance even as they decay. And even though these won't give me lemonade, they gave Parvati and me a fun idea of making a face mandala, and of course, the fun won't stop there. After almost an hour-long interaction with these lemons, I feel so much better, zesty, and refreshed to take on change one day at a time. As for Parvati, she's decided to hold on to these lemons a little longer as more ideas come to her mind. I say there's much to do about these lemons of life as long as ideas continue to flow.

Now, a team from the University of California (UC), Riverside, is joining the effort of many other academic and industry researchers to identify new drug candidates. They have developed a machine learning drug discovery pipeline to identify hundreds of new potential drugs that could help treat COVID-19.\n\nThe drug discovery pipeline is a type of computational strategy linked to artificial intelligence\u2014a computer algorithm that learns to predict activity through trial and error, improving over time.\n\nResearchers used small numbers of previously known ligands for 65 human proteins that are known to interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins, including the ACE2 receptor.\n\nNext, they trained machine learning models to predict inhibitory activity and use them to screen FDA registered chemicals and approved drugs (~100,000) and ~14 million purchasable chemicals.\nThus they were able to create a database of chemicals whose structures were predicted as interactors of the 65 protein targets. They also evaluated the chemicals for safety.\nTaking it a step further, they identified compounds among the hits that are already FDA approved, such as drugs and compounds used in food. They also used the machine learning models to compute toxicity, which helped them reject potentially toxic candidates. This helped them prioritize the chemicals that were predicted to interact with SARS-CoV-2 targets. Their method allowed them to not only identify the highest scoring candidates with significant activity against a single human protein target, but also find a few chemicals that were predicted to inhibit two or more human protein targets.\n\n#artificialintelligence #ai #pharmacyfacts #pharmacyawarness #pharmacystudent #pharmacyblog #pharmablog #covid #covid19awareness #covıd19 #sarscov2 #sars #pandemic #pandemic2020 #epidemic #fda #drugs","NumberOfLikes":17,"Hashtags":["#artificialintelligence","#ai","#pharmacyfacts","#pharmacyawarness","#pharmacystudent","#pharmacyblog","#pharmablog","#covid","#covid19awareness","#covıd19","#sarscov2","#sars","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#epidemic","#fda","#drugs"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by PharmaClass on August 14, 2020.
