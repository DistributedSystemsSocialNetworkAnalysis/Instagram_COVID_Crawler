They diverted existing resources into creating a much needed product for the health and wellbeing of their country! A great example of sustainability. This was literally just weeks after they had worked with us for the Oscars campaign to hand-craft an exquisite gown (see image) for Kaitlyn Dever! \u2063\n🍃\u2063\nLVMH has also committed to getting 30 percent of its energy from renewable sources and reducing carbon emissions by 25 percent throughout the company by the end of 2020 and they are well on track to meeting these goals despite challenges with Covid.

Hoy desperté pensando que ya era viernes, pero mi realidad volvió cuando vi la fecha en la pantalla del celular, pero no fue motivo para que me quedara en la cama, si sino la alarma fue por que es día de levantarse temprano hacer ejercicio. Así que me levante para bajar hacer mi rutina, al terminar me estaba tomando mi café cuando Zoe despertó y desde la noche me dijo que iba hacer ejercicio conmigo, así que le puse su \u201Cropa deportiva\u201D para hacer 3 minutos de ejercicio y después meternos a bañar. El papi me ayudó a cambiarla para que yo terminara de alistarme y no tardar más en cajas hacer el desayuno, bajamos y Zoe quiso hacer su huevo verde, así que desayuno huevo verde. Después salimos un rato a jugar en el jardín para regresar a que durmiera la siesta. En cuánto quedó dormida me fui al súper a compra fruta y verdura para la semana, cuando regrese Zoe ya había despertado e iba bajando con el papi, bajo con el a su cueva en lo que yo sacaba más cosas de la comida. Luego subieron a que comiéramos para ir por Kuko y sus papis en la camioneta e ir al parque a jugar. En casi 5 meses fue la primera vez que Zoe regresó a un parque, a pesar de ver el área de juegos, sabía que no podía ir y que solo habíamos ido a correr con Kuko en el pasto. Como todo niño, obvio pidió ir al área de juegos, pero le volví a contar la historia del bichito y entendió, y cuando comenzó a correr con Kuko se le olvidó que había juegos y otros niños en ellos. Estuvimos hasta que comenzó a obscurecer y regresamos al carro para retornar a casa haciendo primero parada en casa de Kuko. Llegando a casa el papi bajo a su princesa para lavarle las manos, comió algo antes de subir para prepararnos para dormir.\n\n#zoedemicorazon🐥 #recolectandomomentos #staysafeathome #fighting👑🦠 #motherhoodincovid19 #SocialDistancing #FlattentheCurve #stayhomechallenge #stayhomesafelifes #pandemic2020 #quaranteam","NumberOfLikes":10,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597378495,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 14 06:14:55 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"Here\u2019s to 48 years!!

The families uprooted and torn apart through both world wars, the horrors of the holocaust, the wars that continue to be battled around the world.\nAnd I don\u2019t know about you, but it makes me feel somewhat pathetic.

It\u2019s not about comparing.

Today it was spaghetti worms with a mixture of colours - to focus on the sense of sight, as well as smell, touch, sound of them dropping on the high chair & also a little bit of taste!\n\nSurprisingly, Toby was not interested in eating these today, however please keep in mind that babies love to experiment with \"taste\", so items must be big enough to be safe and also okay for baby to put in their mouths!  \n\nThis activity today was totally unstructured, open-ended & not product-oriented - providing the purest sense of exploratory learning through self expression \n\nBenefits of spaghetti sensory play: \n \n🔸 Helps build nerve connections in the brain\u2019s pathways, which lead to the child\u2019s ability to complete more complex learning tasks\n\n🔸 Supports language development as it was a great opportunity to explore language and use descriptive words. Words to describe what Toby was experiencing, his senses and what he may have felt today included slippery, slimy, soft, squishy and sticky\n\n🔸 Provided an opportunity for colour exploration \n\n🔸Numeracy focuses: \n\u2022 Use the prepositions \u2018up\u2019 and \u2018down\u2019, & also incorporating more language around prepositions with the the word \u2018drop\u2019 - you can repeat this as you drop strands in front of baby - demonstrating cause and effect \n\u2022 Counting strands of spaghetti \n\n🔸Improving concentration as it promotes problem solving through picking up, pulling apart, & putting the strands back together \n\n🔸Introduces actions such as shaping, scooping, moulding, pushing & pulling \n\n🔸Aids in developing and enhancing memory through these repetitive actions & language around the activity \n\n🔸 Helps children learn sensory attributes - sticky, slippery, hot, cold etc\n\n🔸Enhances fine motor skills & hand muscles \n\nHave fun!","NumberOfLikes":5,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by NTT - Creative Minds on August 13, 2020.

Everyone\u2019s worlds have been turned upside down. Some are able to handle that better than others. Some are dealing with heightened anxiety, stress, and\/or depression for various reasons and each of these things look different for everyone.\n\nAs someone who has anxiety and mild depression, this pandemic pushed me over the edge due to everything going on in the world combined with other stressful moments in my life that I\u2019d like to keep private out of respect for who those moments involve. I never had extreme physical anxiety symptoms until this year. I truly had no idea what was happening at first. I sought medical care multiple times and each time was told I was fine (thank God!). But the symptoms persisted. I was also losing more sleep than usual and having more mental breakdowns than usual. I noticed myself withdrawing from certain friends\/family and doing the complete opposite to other friends\/family. Basically, it got to the point where I finally decided to see a counselor specialized in anxiety. I put off seeing one for years but after my first meeting, I felt silly as to why I waited so long.\n\nNone of this might seem major to you. Or you may resonate with me. Either way, I hope you understand the importance of making mental health a priority and making YOURSELF a priority. I know it\u2019s easier said than done but don\u2019t be afraid to seek the help you need.\n\nI\u2019m sharing this with you all because I like to be fully transparent. As a blogger who chooses to share many moments of joy and lots of light hearted content like makeup, food, lifestyle, etc, I choose to share the raw and real moments as well. We\u2019re all human. We\u2019re all navigating through our own difficult moments.

I think you knew I needed you. \n\nYour March arrival marked such change; nothing that was, is today. Everything I had known of motherhood was uprooted and blown away. Not just shifting from 1 to 2, but from living outside to retreating in. You knew I needed a distraction from the darkness, a light to cast shadows within my anxious mind. You challenged me to adapt quickly, to remain stable, because I was your warmth, your nourishment, your survival. You showed how much love my heart can hold when it would have been so easy to feel only heartbreak of things lost. While I mourned that no one else could hold you and marvel in your soft squishiness, I failed to realize that me being able to have you and your sister to myself was what kept me together- 2 puzzle pieces I needed to see the big picture. You smiled for the first time on Easter, our first family holiday celebrated completely alone. That smile saved me from crumbling into \u201Cwhys and unfairs\u201D. As I\u2019ve begun to adjust to what now is and feel more like myself, I can fully recognize just how big of a gift you were and continue to be. My light in the darkness, my reminder that this year is still full of joy, and my purpose as we look upon the coming seasons. No matter what the rest of this year becomes, you\u2019ll make sure I make it through. You knew I needed you. 📸 @wheretheheartisfilms #tbt","NumberOfLikes":66,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Kristen Spigiel in Bronson BirthPlace Mother\/Baby Unit.

Why is this the experience I am having?\n\nIt is through a personal sense of integrity that I am able to cultivate a quietude, to thrive in solitary isolation. How do I allow this self acceptance to permeate my social reality?\n\nI breath. I contemplate. I take an inward journey. Perhaps a little scrying.

Many Hongkongers also do not trust the CCP\u2019s official infection and death data. Hong Kong airline Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. will be a beneficiary of the new policy, enabling Chinese students to resume studies at overseas universities, given rival Hong Kong Airlines fly only regionally in Asia, the South China Morning Post reported.\n\nStudents from China are expected to be able to fly to countries in the European Union after China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian indicated on Aug. 10 that Beijing would reciprocate the European Council\u2019s June 30 proposal to lift travel restrictions. The EU said it would open up travel to China if Beijing reciprocated the gesture...

And boy has it been a trip. The last 5 years I have bounced from job to job to job and just hating everything about it... even when I went into my field. The good thing about that job was I met the love of my life @mcelroy.adam but I still didn't like it. Bounced around a few more jobs landing back in retail and then a pandemic happened. As the world was starting to open up again I decided to give it one more shot at the career job thing. I applied and went to a few interviews, and was not chosen for any of them. Then I saw an ad on @indeedworks for a case manager working with homeless families for a company that I worked with before, the YMCA. I sent my resume directly to them and got a response for an interview. I went on three more interviews after that and was selected for the position. I have only been here a month and a half and I see myself making moves here. I can use my skill set from working with kids to helping the adults find stability. And my great listening skills are the icing on the cake. I have never wanted a job so much that everyday I want to wake up and go to work. No day is the same as the last one. I finally found my career where if I made no money off of this, I would still be happy. #homeless #homelessness #homelessshelter #families #familieshelpingfamilies #casemanager #ymca #socialservices #socialserviceworker #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealth #psychology #mastersnumber2 #reflection #lovelife #pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":20,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Jazzy Double H 👑💋⚓🍷☕️🐾🐾 in Massachusetts.

Both are true at the same time.\u2063\n\u2063\nFor those that are parents, the difficult job of parenting is further complicated this year due to the pandemic, no matter what your individual situation.\u2063\n\u2063\nDr. Kristin Neff writes about Self-Compassion, and it is one of the most grounding things I believe we can apply to parenting.\u2063\n\u2063\nShe describes self-compassion like this:\u2063\n\"Instead of mercilessly judging and criticizing yourself for various inadequacies or shortcomings, self-compassion means you are kind and understanding when confronted with personal failings \u2013 after all, who ever said you were supposed to be perfect?\"\u2063\n\u2063\nThe 3 ingredients necessary (according to Neff, summarized by me) for self-compassion are:\u2063\n\u2063\n1. Self-kindness vs. Self-judgment:\u2063\nWe are warm and understanding to ourselves when we suffer, fail or feel inadequate, instead of beating ourselves up internally.\u2063\n\u2063\n2. Common humanity vs. Isolation:\u2063\nKnowing you are not the only one...recognizing that suffering and personal inadequacy are a part of all of our human experience.\u2063\n\u2063\n3. Mindfulness vs. Over-identification:\u2063\nThe balance of naming how you feel with compassion, without stuffing it, or without being swept away by it. \u2063\n\u2063\nThese 3 ingredients applied to parenting could look like:\u2063\nI am not parenting my child today in the way that I want to. I am having a hard time being as present or as patient as I want to be today. I notice that I am so tired. And I know I am not the only parent struggling with this right now. Even though I want to do better, beating myself up about it will not help. I need some tenderness, some rest, and the understanding that I can start over at any moment, even now.\u2063\n\u2063\nCheering on all parents today❤️.","NumberOfLikes":111,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Monica DiCristina, LPC on August 13, 2020.

It causes me to examine my heart and walk. It forces me to sit with the fact that this world is broken and busted.\n\nThis fallen world experiences plenty of pain, disease and heartache, but it sure seems like there are times when our plate is full. Full of hurt. Full of pain. Full of brokenness. Full of grief.\n\nIn moments like these, I am like a child with pursed lips refusing another bite of food, I can\u2019t stomach anymore. \n\nJust like the food nourishes the child\u2019s body, I have noticed when I sit with my unsettled heart, feeling all the emotions, experiencing all the grief, God meets me there and nourishes my soul. With each painful blow, my roots dig deeper.\n\nTaste and see that the Lord is good.\n\nHow can we taste the goodness of God when our mouths are full of the bitterness of this broken world?\n\nLook at the verses that are the bookends to the verse about tasting God\u2019s goodness...\n\nThe angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear him, and delivers them.

Fear the LORD, you his saints, for those who fear him have no lack!\nPsalm 34:7-9\n\nFearing God, standing in awe of his power and sovereignty which, in turn, causes us to trust him is where we taste God\u2019s goodness.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting isn\u2019t it that \u2018taste and see that the Lord is good\u2019 is sandwiched right in between the vaccine for anxiety even in the middle of a pandemic:\n𝙛𝙚𝙖𝙧 𝙂𝙤𝙙.\n\nOpen our eyes to see him encamped around us.

Arriving early, the sun was still too high to shoot, but as I paused for a moment, I suddenly felt drawn to Kuta's small lanes.\n\nLike many, I've had numerous experiences on and around these colorful streets; that allows the good, bad, and indifferent to flourish. But sadly, nothing could prepare me for what lay ahead.\n\nWith every step I took, my heart grew heavy as a relentless and uncomfortable feeling began to overwhelm me. Everything I knew, everything I remembered, had seemingly vanished, replaced by the view of a new harsh reality.\n\nA world of cold emptiness surrounded me, an unexpected every day seemingly decimated by an unseen enemy, leaving a silent trail of collateral damage - the very people that made this tiny part of the world so colorful.\n\nThe only thing that seems to remain now are the echoes of the past, a distant memory few believe will be found again.\n\nI stumbled across a man sitting alone, staring into the abyss of a screen designed to connect us. As we chatted, my heart sank further when he shared a parting thought.\n\n\"I don't think COVID will kill me, but I may die of hunger\".\n\nI did manage to watch the sunset, but as the beautiful sphere of hope drifted towards the horizon, I was acutely aware that this reality will rise again tomorrow.\n\nSWIPE FOR MORE PHOTOS➡️➡️\n\n#bali #balivscovid #pandemic2020 #balistrong #balibangkit #balinow #ilovebali #backtonormal #newnormal #balinewnormal #duecovid19 #supportbali #balispirit #hopeful #balivscorona","NumberOfLikes":15,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597326571,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 13 15:49:31 CEST 2020","Location":"Bali"},{"CaptionText":"Day 3-I have discovered watermelon!\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#littlebigfatfluffymonsterbaby #snickerstheguineapig #babyguineapig #guineapigsofinstagram #cavy #pandemic2020 #lockdown2020 #lockdownchronicles #miracleoflife #birth #dayone #guineapiglover #guineapigs #guineapiglife #spoiledguineapigs #lifeofpets #petsofinstagram #animalphotoraphy #guineapigphotography #smallanimals #exoticpets #guineapighabitat","NumberOfLikes":33,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597326562,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 13 15:49:22 CEST 2020","Location":"Long Island - New York"},{"CaptionText":"Acompáñanos este viernes y conozcamos la otra cara de la pandemia, descubre cómo es vivirla desde la trinchera médica #coronavirus #pandemic2020 #pandemiaméxico #quedateencasa #notedigo","NumberOfLikes":2,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by NO TE DIGO! on August 13, 2020.

We live too far from each other to go out and drink a Chaï latte. 🙊 Instead we love to spend time talking on the phone sharing our thoughts about life and discussing society. How we as humans act and behave, and how magical the universe actually is. I met so many \npeople on my journey, but never someone like him. He is a beautiful rare soul with a very unique vision on the world. 🌍💙 It\u2019s no coincidence that I asked him for an interview about love. On Instagram I am bounded to a certain amount of character, so I will share a part here. Make sure to check my website for the whole article, will share the link in my bio. 🔝\nMake sure to check his site: www.bhavnath.com for more inspirational feeds. ✨\n\nAs always I started the interview with the short introduction why I started with the Looks of Love and how the idea was born, followed with my famous question; \u201Cwhat does love mean to you?\u201D. 💕\n\nHe became silent and answered rapidly and so sincere; \u201Ca few years ago I should have needed time to reflect on this question\u201D. For me love is dissolving yourself with everything surrounding you. Being able to experience no sense of separation creates an ultimate feeling of freedom which is an essential element in love. When you emerge with everything you feel a deeper connection with so many things like food, music, nature, even the stars and the moon. ✨🌖\nWhat will make you more grounded and at ease. This form of connection and freedom will make it possible for you to trust the process of life. 🙌🏻\n\nOff course self love is a fundamental key is we speak about love.

Slow Urbanisation: Not only the rural areas have been affected but also filled up an irreplaceable void between the mode of education and urban children. The lack of networks is a major problem but apart from that there are severe other things to be noted such as change in attitude of the individual , behavioral differences , competitive attributes and growth of shyness and ignorant state of mind are also to be seen in a massive amount if not addressed now.\n3. Natural Calamities : The landslides in Kerala , Flood in Bihar, Assam, Mumbai , West Bengal and Odisha , Earthquake in Delhi and several other calamities haven't been taken into consideration before starting online education. Migration is one such circumstantial issue. The children of that region have been facing such disasters with an unavoidable pandemic has remained unchecked by the Ministry of Education.

Konon, banyak Mamak yang sudah terkena darting karena sekolah daring. Ah, apa iya? \n\nMakanya saya rekomendasikan SabaQu. Supaya anak-anak belajarnya lebih asik. Karena, gimana nggak asik, lha wong belajar kayak bermain kok. Mamaknya juga bisa ikutan. Beneran lho.

Located just up the hill from the \u201CSnow White Cottages\u201D in Los Feliz - on Lyric Avenue - you\u2019ll find the identical homes of Walt & Roy Disney! \n\nFollowing the success of their first cartoon character \u201COswald the Lucky Rabbit\u201D in 1926, Walt and Roy bought an empty lot on Lyric Avenue in Los Feliz (not far from their new Disney Hyperion Studios) and built matching homes next door to each other! \n\nAfter construction was completed, Walt and Lillian moved into their home at 2495 Lyric Avenue and Roy and Edna moved in next door at 2491 Lyric Avenue - luckily both homes still stand today! Please note that these are private residences so if you visit please do not trespass or disturb the people that live there.\n\nLittle did Walt know that his distributor, Charles Mintz, owned the rights to Oswald\u2019s cartoons. Disney wouldn\u2019t let the threat of losing Oswald get him down, as he had something bigger in the works. It was in the garage of this house that Walt, Roy, and his chief animator Ub Iwerks secretly worked on Mickey Mouse cartoons while they were still under contract with Universal Studios for Oswald. In the end, Universal ended up with the rights to Oswald, and Disney sketched a character that would eclipse Oswald in popularity: Mickey Mouse! \n\nAfter the success of Mickey Mouse and the studio\u2019s first Oscar (Silly Symphonies Flowers and Treeswon the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, the first time an award in this category was given out) the Disney\u2019s moved to Woking Way in 1932.\n\nFun fact - Walt Disney didn\u2019t draw Mickey Mouse. He did at first, but it didn\u2019t last long\u2014after 1928, Walt was no longer animating, focusing instead on story development and direction. He relied on Iwerks and other artists to do the drawing dirty work. Walt Disney did voice Mickey Mouse. From 1928 to 1947, Walt was the man behind the mouse\u2014literally. #waltdisney #lyricavenue #hollywoodhistory #mickeymouse #losfeliz #hollywoodtour #pandemic2020 #socialdistancing #wearamask😷 #tonymiros","NumberOfLikes":50,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1597253800,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 12 19:36:40 CEST 2020","Location":"Los Feliz"},{"CaptionText":"Don\u2019t break yourself during a pandemic.

In the last 2 months, more than 20,000 Covid positive patients and their families have been touched and counselled for any mental issues that they might be facing. Also, their problems  of financial distress, lack of availability of commodities, etc have been attempted to be addressed too with the sincere aid of the District administration and the Dept. Of Health. \n\nBut the feather on the cap right now is that Monon has started to reach out to the general public as well, especially the children, who have been massively hit by the lockdown. We are now organising online competitions in the categories of Drawing\/Painting, Jingle contest, Music Contest, Dance, Poetry Recitation and Mime, and many more are still on the tracks. The responses we have received so far have been overwhelming. And what the children have to offer have motivated us to work harder and stronger. 🙂\n\nI sincerely hope that Monon can reach and surpass the targets that it kept at its outset because Mental Health of each and everyone of us out here and out there matters. And working for mental health is not only about Lets Talk. I guess its more about LET'S WORK! ✌🏼❤\n\nA special word of gratitude to News Live for doing this story on Monon. We look forward to more of them in the future.

We have shared a good number of happy as well as sad moments together. As we started growing up, we got closer and closer. We both felt incomplete if we couldn't share anything which was going on in our lives back then. If any of us forgot to tell each other something which some other friend already knew, we used to get angry and wouldn't talk with each other for days. In the midst of everything, we didn't realize that we had actually \"fallen for each other. \"\nAnd it was on 12.08.2010, (we were in 10th grade) we officially got into a relationship. Back then it was a hush-hush affair and we tried our best to hide it from everyone. Except for a few close friends (who actually used to save us during troubles), we didn't tell anyone. It was mostly the teenage kind of love and we were drooling in a fairy-tale land. \nWe used to fight a lot, decided to end our relationship forever and then again, came back to each other. We became inevitable for each other. \nGradually we entered adulthood, our maturity level changed, our aims in life changed but amidst all the changes, our feelings for each other remained the same. Day by day we realized that love is not just about holding hands and clicking pictures, it's all about commitments and being there for each other under all tough situations. We do have our period of ups and down, be it personal or professional. There are times we feel claustrophobic dealing with day to day life. But then, one of us will always be there for the other person to motivate and cheer up. Now our love has turned us into each other's support system. Many people ask that how we are staying in the same relationship for so many years. Honestly speaking, we don't know the answer. It's just that we can't think of a life without each other. We fight even now yet we  never feel like giving up. We don't know what's there for us in the future. We don't claim to be the perfect couple too. With blessings from both of our families, we are trying to build a simple yet happy life. \n#love #truelove #beingthereforeachother #decade #gharbandi #pandemic2020 #gocorona #positivevibes #lovestory  #relationshipgoals","NumberOfLikes":22,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597239270,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 12 15:34:30 CEST 2020","Location":"Kolkata"},{"CaptionText":"Went to my dressing room yesterday.

In years past, the last crop of peaches signaled an end to summer. I'm not sure why because August and most of September are brutally hot in Georgia. Yet there is something about peaches that symbolizes summer to me. Perhaps it is my bi-weekly trips to the local farmers market to pick up fresh peaches. Perhaps it is because I cut up a peach and put it in my cereal every morning and eat another for lunch. Perhaps it is the various desserts I make with peaches,  with cobbler being my favorite.  It could even be that the last peaches coincide with children returning to school in Georgia. Every year I look forward to summer for two reasons, the peaches, and summer vacation. This year we had no vacation but we had fabulous Georgia peaches. Now the peaches are gone, the pandemic is still here, and the children in my community are not returning to school in-person.

SIGNALS is a continuation of a series of projects in which participants communicate with each other using uncommon means. In a global situation of calls for social distancing, this work speaks about the search for an alternative language for distance communication. In a series of short videos, I wear a face mask and send short Morse code messages by blinking with my eyes.\n\nTo me, the language of art is primarily symbolic. It should give no suggestions for direct application. Thus, in SIGNALS I do not offer the Morse code as a practical way of communication, but rather provoke to be inventive in connecting with whatever means are available in any unusual or critical situation.\n\nAt a time when the pandemic intensifies nationalist sentiments with new forms of localization rapidly emerging, the urge for international dialogue is extremely palpable. Art, within its own means, should also deal with communication beyond the national, while seeking the humane and the universal.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#performanceart #contemporaryart #videoartist #pandemicact #covidchallenge #sarievselfisolation\n#morsecodeart #pandemic2020 #wearamask #arttherapy #artperformer #lockdownart #blackandwhitevideo #secretmessage #eyes #eyesart #sofiabulgaria #newart #vittovalentinov @vittovalentionov #artexperiment #sos #signals #humanmachine","NumberOfLikes":26,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1597217316,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 12 09:28:36 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#kolkatalockdown #kolkata #pandamic #pandemic2020 #kolkatastreets #blackandwhitelife #blackandwhite  #picoftheday #juxtaposition #streetlife #buildings #contemporaryart #afternoon #nature #architecture #traditional #reflection #oldbuildings #britisharchitecture #bengal #bengalarchitecture #rajbari #oldrajbari #emptyroads #2020vision #perspective #bengalihouse #lockdown2020 #interior #kolkatamoments","NumberOfLikes":21,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by saikat paul in Redbrick Residency, Heritage Guest House.

Mesmo tomando todas as precauções, não pense você que estará imune à problemas. Só quem tem um negócio sabe, que não é fácil. Mas que quando você supera entende que era necessário passar por aquele começo, e que por mais que você queira, ele não vai voltar, porque já se tornou parte do seu passado. \nEntão comece a olhar em volta, e entender que tudo que acontece na sua vida, grande parte da culpa é sua. E que não existem finais felizes, sem começos dolorosos. \nO que importa de verdade não está aonde você quer chegar, mas sim tudo aquilo que você carrega dentro de você, isso te fez chegar aonde está, e vai fazer você chegar aonde acredita que possa chegar. \nE quando partimos desse plano pra outro,  a única coisa que fica é história.\n\nE você como tem escrito a sua história, pensando no final ou aproveitando cada capítulo? \n\nSalva ✅\n\nComenta se leu até aqui 👀♥️.\n#textosdeamor #caminho #autoresponsabilidade  #texto #textosdeamor #textoautoral #texto","NumberOfLikes":114,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by D A N I E L   J U N I O R in Foz do Iguaçu.

It\u2019s not a panacea, but it makes reality feel a little more manageable than if otherwise, and I\u2019ll take that! \n\u2063\n\n\u2063\n\n\u2063\n\n\u2063\n\n\u2063\n@acupuncturediaries #takeiteasy #quarantinelife #stayathome #present #beherenow #presentcentered #now #coronavirus #quarantine #rest #onedayatatime #selfcompassion #begentle #mentalheath #mentalwellness #selfcare #practice #ipreview #stayinthenow #hanginthere #marathoncontinues #covid19 #pandemic #pandemic2020 #pandemiclife #breathe #breatheinbreatheout #breathedeep via @preview_app","NumberOfLikes":8,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Gratitude Acupuncture in Denver, Colorado.

If you feel like this pandemic\/quarantine makes you want to scream for normalcy and all the things you can\u2019t do, just know you\u2019re not alone. Not only are you not alone, but some of us have lived in quarantine from our true selves our whole lives. It\u2019s agonizing. It\u2019s even more agonizing to get out of bc of how comfortable complacency can make us. Everyone is forced to look at everything that\u2019s wrong in their lives right now because the distractions aren\u2019t really there. Trust me, I miss them too. Even if I didn\u2019t always use them, it was nice to know they were there. I hope everyone is hanging in there, parents especially.

Within a night, many houses, schools, and even bridges on and along the riverside get washed into the river. And sometimes in the worst scenario even several villages get sunk into it.\n\nI interviewed this gentleman, last winter. Upendra Yadav works as a salesman in a medicine firm. Once a zamindar with around 30 bigha land, he has now relocated to a village away from the river and owns around 12 Katha land only. That too he earned with his sweat and blood over the years as a migrant worker in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, and New Delhi. His native village was situated on the northern frontier of gopalganj, boarding with Champaran. This region is called Dieara, which is one of the adversely affected areas in monsoon.\n\nIt was 1990, the Gandak's flow was very wild and it had begun eroding the agricultural land of his village. And within days, his home, his land, and even his livelihood completely faded away. All that once was a happy and fertile place was turned into a riverbed. The homeless natives moved to nearby towns and had to start from point-blank. Although the flow of the river has changed its course over time. what now left is only sand and barren land, where nothing grows. Upendra recalls only once they got seven thousand rupees as compensation for their now dead farming. Although he and many others from his village still apply for mutation of their land in government registry records fearing encroachment by other villagers and even mafia. Lately, the swallowing river not only snatched their hard-earned house and livelihood but their ancestral roots and culture excessively.\n\nAnd stories like that of Upendra matter and are needed to be told and shared.\n\nThe recent flood-like always will make many new Upendra who will flood into your concrete -hearted cities.\n \n#wokerslife #pandemic2020 \n#undiscoveredindia #biharfloods #noworktoday #rurallife #flooding","NumberOfLikes":53,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597180728,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 11 23:18:48 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"1 month ago I married this guy... in another year I get to marry him again! #pandemic2020 #popthebubbly","NumberOfLikes":60,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Katharine Macpherson on August 11, 2020.

Isso significa que você estará capacitado a desenvolver um trabalho técnico e bem remunerado em apenas 2 anos!\n⠀\n2️\u20E3 EMPREGABILIDADE: Os técnicos têm vaga garantida no mercado de trabalho! Atualmente, a demanda por profissionais com capacidades técnicas tem aumentado muito. Durante o curso é possível ingressar em um estágio e construir sua carreira a partir de então.\n⠀\n3️\u20E3 CUSTO X BENEFÍCIO: É só comparar! O custo total de uma formação técnica é significativamente mais baixo que o de uma graduação. Isso certamente não impede que você faça uma graduação posteriormente, mas te proporciona retorno sobre o seu investimento de maneira mais rápida.\n⠀\n💥 Agora só falta escolher qual curso você vai fazer aqui no Colégio de Itajubá! 📚\n.\n.\n.\n#cursoonline #cursotecnico #desenvolvimentoprofissional #pandemic2020 #escolas #mercadodetrabalho #segurancadotrabalho #mecatronica #contabilidade #administração #trabalho #profissionalismo #jovens #alunos #tecnic #tecnico #empresarial #faculdades #matrículasabertas #matriculas #aulasonline #aulaonline #professores #futuros #profissao #aprendiz #estudando #estudante #itajuba #minasgerais🔺","NumberOfLikes":12,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Colégio de Itajubá on August 11, 2020.

It may or may not help with the admission, but it will definitely validate the students' sense of self worth. \n\nFamily and friends, please don't go around asking people what their child got. They will share it if they want to. \n\nStand by your kids and do all in your power to help them reach those dreams even if they need to make some adjustments to the immediate route. The final destination does not depend on high school grades...if it did, many of us would not have achieved our ambitions.\n\n#alevel2020 #ib2020 #pandemic2020 #congratulations🎉 #proudofyou","NumberOfLikes":33,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by StEPSEdu on August 11, 2020.
