Rates of suicide, domestic violence and all forms of abuse have risen astronomically. If you\u2019re blessed to have a job, security and happiness at this time - remember that the majority, are not as fortunate as you. \n\nI count my blessings, I practise gratitude - but I\u2019m prone to triggers. Lockdown makes me feel trapped and isolated, which evokes sadness & anxieties. Outdoor walks are helping me get through the days and I need only reach out - to realise, I am not alone.\n\nWe are truly in this together, I frequently FaceTime my family in the UK, my sis-in-law my girlfriends and my Uni mates, and we\u2019re all over it & feeling the same... There are common emotions & triggers we are all experiencing.\n\nI\u2019ve been so happy to notice alot of people creating music, painting & channeling their inner child whilst all this is going on. I think it\u2019s really beautiful & therapeutic - in a way, we are healing. This is a time of self-reflection and as I say often, healing often means falling first to learn later.\n\nBe kind, to yourself & those around you, try not to do things that harm you. Be accountable, open up to those you trust, splurge on things that are good for you. Before you fire up, attempt to understand where your fear is coming from. Communicate honestly, choose vulnerability instead... you\u2019d be surprised how many people can relate.\n\nRegardless of your view on the situation. Don\u2019t cut yourself off, If you\u2019re feeling depression, anxiety, fear or anger; know that you\u2019re not alone. Reach out to your tribe, it\u2019s more important than ever, that we\u2019re here to support one another. ♥️\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#lockdown  #covid19 #saveourchildren  #corona #pandemic2020  #viclockdown  #domesticviolence  #abuse #healing  #therapy  #heal  #pandemic  #covid  #bloggers  #photography  #typography  #wordsmith  #middleeasternmusic  #shortpoetry #thelatestquote  #goodvibes  #lifequotes  #love  #poetrycommunity  #poem  #poet  #poems  #quotes  #writer","NumberOfLikes":41,"Hashtags":["#lockdown","#covid19","#saveourchildren","#corona","#pandemic2020","#viclockdown","#domesticviolence","#abuse","#healing","#therapy","#heal","#pandemic","#covid","#bloggers","#photography","#typography","#wordsmith","#middleeasternmusic","#shortpoetry","#thelatestquote","#goodvibes","#lifequotes","#love","#poetrycommunity","#poem","#poet","#poems","#quotes","#writer"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ልꪑ\u200Bꫀ\u200Bꫀ\u200B𝘳\u200Bꪖ 🇦🇺🇬🇧🇮🇪🇦🇪 in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

We wear masks and our skin is peeling from the amount of sanitizer we use on the regular.\n.\nAnd yet, we tell ourselves that it could be so much worse. Because it could. We play over all the terrible events of history that Covid couldn\u2019t possibly hold a candle too. The families uprooted and torn apart through both world wars, the horrors of the holocaust, the wars that continue to be battled around the world.\nAnd I don\u2019t know about you, but it makes me feel somewhat pathetic. That I would feel so inconvenienced to wear a mask and stay home and not get to see my family, when they\u2019re also staying home but well. \n.\nThe fact is though, this is nothing to feel pathetic about. It\u2019s not about comparing. Your feelings of anxiety towards the unknown, the dread of fall and a \u201Csecond wave\u201D, the frustration of all the dreams and plans that were seemingly halted or destroyed.

Words to describe what Toby was experiencing, his senses and what he may have felt today included slippery, slimy, soft, squishy and sticky\n\n🔸 Provided an opportunity for colour exploration \n\n🔸Numeracy focuses: \n\u2022 Use the prepositions \u2018up\u2019 and \u2018down\u2019, & also incorporating more language around prepositions with the the word \u2018drop\u2019 - you can repeat this as you drop strands in front of baby - demonstrating cause and effect \n\u2022 Counting strands of spaghetti \n\n🔸Improving concentration as it promotes problem solving through picking up, pulling apart, & putting the strands back together \n\n🔸Introduces actions such as shaping, scooping, moulding, pushing & pulling \n\n🔸Aids in developing and enhancing memory through these repetitive actions & language around the activity \n\n🔸 Helps children learn sensory attributes - sticky, slippery, hot, cold etc\n\n🔸Enhances fine motor skills & hand muscles \n\nHave fun!","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by NTT - Creative Minds on August 13, 2020.

Pandora's box is open.  Welcome.\n Controlling the system through digital slavery.  Exploitation will be a blessing.  The purchase of significantly cheaper global manufacturing assets will begin soon.\n The Central Bank, Central Banks, the Basel Committee give recommendations to all the Central Banks of the World.  The center of global government is in Basel, Switzerland.\n Those who did not support became Outcasts.\n Syria, Iran, North Korea.\n All current business models are not sustainable and must be revised.  This is an obvious Fact.\n This is how a new world is born.  Globalization has occurred through the World Financial System.  The public still loves dollars, and the Fed is ready to print them in the amount needed to buy all the debt obligations.  It is about buying up the assets of the industrial sector of the world economy.\n The unit of calculation is a significant element of the system.  The pandemic is just a cover.  In the near future, the Eurozone will be torn apart by inequality and imbalances in the deepening economic crisis.  Artificial Deficit of financial liquidity.  Subject to a significant overproduction of the money supply.  The printing press is working properly.  Colossal decline in consumption in the real sector.\n The local dictatorship looks quite appropriate against this background, it is soft and fluffy compared to the soulless global financial system controlled by algorithms and robots.  In the financial system, for a long time, decisions are not made by people, therefore, it is impossible to agree with the system.  The decision is made before the algorithms are set up, after programming the algorithms begin to work. >>> #economy #forecast #banks #finance #economics #globalization #economyforecast #global #newworld #pandemic #pandemic2020 #worldchange","NumberOfLikes":31,"Hashtags":["#economy","#forecast","#banks","#finance","#economics","#globalization","#economyforecast","#global","#newworld","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#worldchange"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1597370669,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 14 04:04:29 CEST 2020","Location":"British Virgin Islands"},{"Owner":"bun_butter_jam_deals","CaptionText":"Customized Cases Available @ just \u20B9150\/- \n.\nDM📩\n#customizedcases #mobilecases \n#mobileaccessories #phonecases #coverandcases #covid19 \n#pandemic2020","NumberOfLikes":8,"Hashtags":["#customizedcases","#mobilecases","#mobileaccessories","#phonecases","#coverandcases","#covid19","#pandemic2020"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597370618,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 14 04:03:38 CEST 2020","Location":"Chennai, India"},{"Owner":"sarahblacker","CaptionText":"I was initially just gonna post this photo in my story, but I decided it was *official post*-worthy. ✨\n\nAt the beginning of this crazy #pandemic, I hung these heart lights in our window, made from a coat-hanger & party lights from @aaronzkatz & my wedding last Sept. ✨\n\nI turn them on each night with love in my heart - I did then & I do now want people to feel that they are not alone. ✨\n\nWhatever you did today, it\u2019s enough.

Everyone\u2019s worlds have been turned upside down. Some are able to handle that better than others. Some are dealing with heightened anxiety, stress, and\/or depression for various reasons and each of these things look different for everyone.\n\nAs someone who has anxiety and mild depression, this pandemic pushed me over the edge due to everything going on in the world combined with other stressful moments in my life that I\u2019d like to keep private out of respect for who those moments involve. I never had extreme physical anxiety symptoms until this year. I truly had no idea what was happening at first. I sought medical care multiple times and each time was told I was fine (thank God!). But the symptoms persisted. I was also losing more sleep than usual and having more mental breakdowns than usual. I noticed myself withdrawing from certain friends\/family and doing the complete opposite to other friends\/family. Basically, it got to the point where I finally decided to see a counselor specialized in anxiety. I put off seeing one for years but after my first meeting, I felt silly as to why I waited so long.\n\nNone of this might seem major to you. Or you may resonate with me. Either way, I hope you understand the importance of making mental health a priority and making YOURSELF a priority. I know it\u2019s easier said than done but don\u2019t be afraid to seek the help you need.\n\nI\u2019m sharing this with you all because I like to be fully transparent. As a blogger who chooses to share many moments of joy and lots of light hearted content like makeup, food, lifestyle, etc, I choose to share the raw and real moments as well. We\u2019re all human.

I think you knew I needed you. \n\nYour March arrival marked such change; nothing that was, is today. Everything I had known of motherhood was uprooted and blown away. Not just shifting from 1 to 2, but from living outside to retreating in. You knew I needed a distraction from the darkness, a light to cast shadows within my anxious mind. You challenged me to adapt quickly, to remain stable, because I was your warmth, your nourishment, your survival. You showed how much love my heart can hold when it would have been so easy to feel only heartbreak of things lost. While I mourned that no one else could hold you and marvel in your soft squishiness, I failed to realize that me being able to have you and your sister to myself was what kept me together- 2 puzzle pieces I needed to see the big picture. You smiled for the first time on Easter, our first family holiday celebrated completely alone. That smile saved me from crumbling into \u201Cwhys and unfairs\u201D. As I\u2019ve begun to adjust to what now is and feel more like myself, I can fully recognize just how big of a gift you were and continue to be. My light in the darkness, my reminder that this year is still full of joy, and my purpose as we look upon the coming seasons. No matter what the rest of this year becomes, you\u2019ll make sure I make it through.

The problem is that we're so busy trying to defend our fears in the act of attacking each other that we've lost sight of the fact that we need to take some responsibility in making a solution possible. \n\nThe bottom line is they're are going to have to get our children back into a learning environment but we also have to understand that it can't be the environment that we have all become formiliar with. There are ways to do this safely but we have to put the effort in the right place in order to make that happen.\n\nIf we're so focused on getting our children back in school by any means necessary the district will be under pressure to give parents what they are asking for (the reopening of school) rather than what our children need (a learning environment that has not cut corners in health and safety requirements to get them through the door).\n\nThere are very effective ways to get our children back into a learning environment where they can have face-to-face instruction where they can be in the presence of other children and they can take advantage of all of the benefits that they have become accustomed to in going to school.\n\nUnderstand that while a pandemic is a school concern it is not with in their area of expertise.

We live too far from each other to go out and drink a Chaï latte. 🙊 Instead we love to spend time talking on the phone sharing our thoughts about life and discussing society. How we as humans act and behave, and how magical the universe actually is. I met so many \npeople on my journey, but never someone like him. He is a beautiful rare soul with a very unique vision on the world. 🌍💙 It\u2019s no coincidence that I asked him for an interview about love. On Instagram I am bounded to a certain amount of character, so I will share a part here. Make sure to check my website for the whole article, will share the link in my bio. 🔝\nMake sure to check his site: www.bhavnath.com for more inspirational feeds. ✨\n\nAs always I started the interview with the short introduction why I started with the Looks of Love and how the idea was born, followed with my famous question; \u201Cwhat does love mean to you?\u201D. 💕\n\nHe became silent and answered rapidly and so sincere; \u201Ca few years ago I should have needed time to reflect on this question\u201D. For me love is dissolving yourself with everything surrounding you. Being able to experience no sense of separation creates an ultimate feeling of freedom which is an essential element in love. When you emerge with everything you feel a deeper connection with so many things like food, music, nature, even the stars and the moon. ✨🌖\nWhat will make you more grounded and at ease. This form of connection and freedom will make it possible for you to trust the process of life. 🙌🏻\n\nOff course self love is a fundamental key is we speak about love. You need to experience it first. How can you explain to someone how sugar tastes if you never tried it? How can you write a poem or a song about love if you were never able to feel loved? How can you share love if you don\u2019t have a clue what it means and if you\u2019re not capable of giving it to yourself first? 🤷🏻\u200D♀️\n\n... to be continued on my site\n \n©️ @subtle_balance","NumberOfLikes":47,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by \u2022 𝕊𝕦𝕓𝕥𝕝𝕖 𝔹𝕒𝕝𝕒𝕟𝕔𝕖 \u2022 in Somewhere in the Universe. with @bhavnath.

If you haven\u2019t been keeping up with my situation here in New York City, then let me briefly tell you. So, back in march I lost my job because of the pandemic. That was really tough because I was self-employed. I spent two months trying to get my PUA (pandemic unemployment benefits) while temporarily on SNAP (welfare) because I lost my job. That was a pain, but I finally got my PUA, thank God. After that I researched and applied to a bunch of companies online. Many declined me and only two accepted my application. I chose to go with the company that I liked better. So then I got my first interview. The first interview was by phone. After that, I was asked to get interviewed again but face-to-face in a virtual setting. I did that and was told that I\u2019ll get feedback in a day or two. When I didn\u2019t hear back from my recruiter after two days, I sent her a follow up email asking about the postion. Later the next day she got back to me, said sorry for the delay and was waiting for more information from the hiring team. She then said that she\u2019d call me later on today. So, I waited and waited while praying to God that I get the job, because I really like it and need it! Then around 3:30PM my recruiter called me and said I\u2019ve got the job!!! SubhanAllah! Glory be to God! Alhamdulillah! I thanked God and then told my recruiter how happy I was to have been hired!!! So, after many months of worrying about how I was going to provide for my family and I, and after a lot of prayers and trust in the Creator, He has made a way for me. Alhamdulillah, praise be to God. \nFor those of you who have been with me through this crazy time, thank you. I really appreciate your kind words, encouragement and support. If you haven\u2019t followed me on my account @lionbeardkhannyc then I invite you to do so. I\u2019m still doing NYC walking videos, showing you around New York City. I still plan on writing\/journaling what\u2019s going on here and with my situation. The only addition is that I post videos and goofy things here and there, and share with you more about myself. Again, thank you and thank you for reading!... A new chapter awaits and the journey continues. 🕶 - Khan","NumberOfLikes":5,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Lion Beard Khan | NYC in New York City, N.Y..

Trauma can be a ruthless thief, entering quickly and violently, taking whatever it desires.

Because it\u2019s hard to find a babysitter That you trust IN A MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC to watch a baby while their parents get alone time. To avoid us and Jax being in contact with anyone other than our immediate family, we keep the circle small. Your kids health will ALWAYS come first. this was the first and ONLY time Jaxon went inside a store. He wears his mask to protect his uncles, grandparents, aunts, cousins, and YOU. So why not protect him too? My son is only 1 years old and as a new mom, I feel I got robbed of park dates, unnecessary target runs, & dining in for lunch\/dinner dates. Granted & I can only hope that someday everything will be back to normal & I will get to take him to play at the park & play with other kids. That\u2019s how he\u2019s going to learn.. learn through play.. how can he learn if he\u2019s not allowed to play? Yes, he plays at home with us but just like parents need a break from their kids, he needs a break from his parents. I can only imagine how parents with 2+ kids and over the age 2 are feeling. Quite frankly, it\u2019s tough with just a 1 year old. This quarantine has been bitter sweet, to say the least. I am thankful for my job for taking our health into consideration and letting me stay home with him during these times, but I am also over being stuck in a house. ANNNNDD lets be honest, it\u2019s way to hot for these masks. SO JUST STAY HOME, WEAR A MASK, WASH YOUR HANDS & Lets get back to normal. #setanexample #wearamask #pandemic2020 #oneyearsold #noexcuses #avengersmask #cabinfever #stayhome #washyourhandsyanasty","NumberOfLikes":79,"Hashtags":["#setanexample","#wearamask","#pandemic2020","#oneyearsold","#noexcuses","#avengersmask","#cabinfever","#stayhome","#washyourhandsyanasty"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Alexandra Ruiz🖤 on August 12, 2020.

In the last 2 months, more than 20,000 Covid positive patients and their families have been touched and counselled for any mental issues that they might be facing. Also, their problems  of financial distress, lack of availability of commodities, etc have been attempted to be addressed too with the sincere aid of the District administration and the Dept. Of Health. \n\nBut the feather on the cap right now is that Monon has started to reach out to the general public as well, especially the children, who have been massively hit by the lockdown. We are now organising online competitions in the categories of Drawing\/Painting, Jingle contest, Music Contest, Dance, Poetry Recitation and Mime, and many more are still on the tracks. The responses we have received so far have been overwhelming. And what the children have to offer have motivated us to work harder and stronger. 🙂\n\nI sincerely hope that Monon can reach and surpass the targets that it kept at its outset because Mental Health of each and everyone of us out here and out there matters. And working for mental health is not only about Lets Talk. I guess its more about LET'S WORK! ✌🏼❤\n\nA special word of gratitude to News Live for doing this story on Monon. We look forward to more of them in the future.

Duke University recently published a study on August 7, 2020 which focused on which type of mask is more effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19. \u2063\n\u2063\nOne of the authors and Associate Professor of Medicine at Duke University, Dr. Eric Westman, says the study is one of the first that focuses on masks made for community use, such as cotton masks or bandanas. \u2063\n\u2063\nResearchers tested 14 different types of commonly used masks that they have seen used in communities. They wanted to figure out which masks are good and which are bad. The study used a laser, camera, and black box to visualize the respiratory droplet particles that we don\u2019t readily see. A subject would then say, \u201Cstay healthy people\u201D five times, and the number of particles dispersed would be reviewed. \u2063\n\u2063\nWhat did they find? The well-fitted N95 masks without valves and three-layer surgical masks are the safest option. However, these masks should still be reserved for health care workers who directly care for patients in the hospitals and\/or clinics with COVID-19. A cotton cloth mask with 2 or more layers is the next most reliable option. \u2063\n\u2063\nSurprisingly, the bandanas, neck fleece or gaiters didn\u2019t work well at all. These mask types did not stop the spread of particles. Instead, they were found to break down large droplets into smaller droplets that can linger in the air and spread more easily. \u2063\n\u2063\nThey also reported that N95 masks with valves may also spread the virus to others especially if the person is an asymptomatic carrier or has COVID-19.  The valve in front of the mask closes during inspiration.  But it opens during expiration allows the person to exhale infected respiratory droplets.  These masks protect the user but they definitely don\u2019t protect others nearby.\u2063\n \u2063\nWhat\u2019s the take home message? When going out, wear a mask that works. Your best option is a well-fitted cotton mask with 2 or more layers. \u2063\n\u2063\nAny questions? \u2063\n\u2063\n#wearamask #maskup\u2063","NumberOfLikes":232,"Hashtags":["#wearamask","#maskup\u2063"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":89,"Timestamp":1597250225,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 12 18:37:05 CEST 2020","Location":"San Francisco, California"},{"Owner":"my__illustrateav__safar","CaptionText":"R.I.P. to the souls in the crash 😓 .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#kozhikode #kozhikodeplanecrashupdates #kozhikodeplanecrash #airindia #planecrash #pandemic2020 #pandemic2020 #motiongraphicsdesign #motiongraphics #illustration #instagram #adobeillustrator #adobe #adobelightroom #animation #aftereffects #rip","NumberOfLikes":41,"Hashtags":["#kozhikode","#kozhikodeplanecrashupdates","#kozhikodeplanecrash","#airindia","#planecrash","#pandemic2020","#pandemic2020","#motiongraphicsdesign","#motiongraphics","#illustration","#instagram","#adobeillustrator","#adobe","#adobelightroom","#animation","#aftereffects","#rip"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597250219,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 12 18:36:59 CEST 2020","Location":"Kozhikode (Calicut), Kerala"},{"Owner":"chapssouth","CaptionText":"South Africa to participate in two more trials for the Covid-19 vaccine.

Very little time in the NOW.\n\nAnd all we have is the NOW. \n\nI found it very uncomfortable to live in the NOW. For many reasons, but mostly because I didn\u2019t know how. My mind raced with thoughts from the past and what could be. I was always coming from a reactive space in my mind. I believed I was my thoughts and beliefs. To be present in the NOW felt impossible.\n\nIn order to get to this space I had to learn to separate myself from my thoughts and beliefs. If I am the witness to these beliefs, then I am NOT these beliefs. And there was peace in that thought.\n\nAnd once I could separate myself from the thoughts, I was able to draw attention to the present moment. I could acknowledge my mind\u2019s thoughts and not get emotionally attached to them. I could be present in my body, focus on what I see, hear, feel, touch, and taste. It felt comforting. It felt like I was ME. There is energy in this space. Clarity. Peace.\n\nAs you navigate through the week, try to draw attention to your thoughts and then observe yourself as the witness to these thoughts. How do you feel in the NOW?\n\n#selflove #findyourself #pandemic2020 #selfgrowth #balance #justenough #personalgrowthanddevelopment #mindsetmatters #mindset #loveyourself #positivemindset #chooseyourlife #selfhealer #nurse #nursing #nurses #nursehealers #nursesinspirenurses #nurseinspired","NumberOfLikes":18,"Hashtags":["#selflove","#findyourself","#pandemic2020","#selfgrowth","#balance","#justenough","#personalgrowthanddevelopment","#mindsetmatters","#mindset","#loveyourself","#positivemindset","#chooseyourlife","#selfhealer","#nurse","#nursing","#nurses","#nursehealers","#nursesinspirenurses","#nurseinspired"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Erin | BSN | RN on August 12, 2020.
