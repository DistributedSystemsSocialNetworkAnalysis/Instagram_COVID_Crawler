For example, just a stone\u2019s throw from the former site of Walt Disney\u2019s original Hyperion studios sits the \u201CSnow White Cottages\u201D\u2014eight whimsical bungalows built in 1931 - that are designated as a historic site and also appear in David Lynch\u2019s 2001 neo-noir thriller \"Mulholland Drive.\"! So for today\u2019s stop on my pandemic Hollywood tour we\u2019re visiting these famous storybook-style cottages! \n\nIn the film, the Snow White Cottages play the Sierra Bonita Apartments where budding actress Betty Elms (Naomi Watts) and her amnesiac new friend Rita (Laura Harring) search for a mysterious stranger named Diane Selwyn. These whimsical cottages, which are a mix of rustic wood and storybook design, are located at \u202A2900 Griffith Park Boulevard\u202C in the Los Feliz\/Silverlake area. Please note that these are private residences so if you visit please do not trespass or disturb the people that live there.\n\nWhile some rumors credit Disney for building the cottages himself, they were actually built and designed by Ben Sherwood. The cottages feature crooked roofs, timber-frame facades, picture-perfect window boxes and landscaping, intentionally-worn chimneys, and a tower at the far end of the bungalow courtyard. Love them! \n\nFun facts - Mulholland Drive was originally conceived as a TV pilot, and a large portion of the film was shot in 1999 with Lynch's plan to keep it open-ended for a potential series. After viewing Lynch's cut, however, television executives rejected it. Lynch then provided an ending to the project, making it a feature film. \n\nNaomi Watts actually lost her health insurance and faced eviction from her apartment shortly after filming wrapped. She was ready to quit acting and leave LA, but her close friend, Nicole Kidman, talked her into staying until after this film was released.\n\nThis was was the last feature film to star veteran Hollywood actress Ann Miller.  Miller portrays Coco, the landlady who welcomes Betty to her wonderful new apartment. #filminglocation #mulhollanddrivemovie #davidlynch #snowwhitecottages  #losfeliz #hollywoodtour #pandemic2020 #socialdistancing #wearamask #tonymiros","NumberOfLikes":38,"Hashtags":["#filminglocation","#mulhollanddrivemovie","#davidlynch","#snowwhitecottages","#losfeliz","#hollywoodtour","#pandemic2020","#socialdistancing","#wearamask","#tonymiros"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597163665,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 11 18:34:25 CEST 2020","Location":"Silverlake \/ Los Feliz"},{"CaptionText":"Home offices are a staple with the start of COVID 19.

And even during this crazy pandemic, our partners have not relented and are still finding new ways to spread the Gospel.\n\nOne of our Central American partners, Cristóbal, recently told us about how he and his organization have altered their ministry so they can witness and evangelize to those who are vulnerable and needy.\n\u2022\n\u201CThe current pandemic has brought an atmosphere of insecurity, fear, and vulnerability, producing anxiety and loss of hope in many people. But it has been good to be able to share about a God of hope.\n\n\u201CWe decided to move where we could be closer to the vulnerable children and adolescents of our \u2018New Life\u2019 project. Most of their parents\u2014Indians and country folk\u2014have lost their jobs because of the pandemic. Some opted to go back to the mountains, while others remain here in the neighborhood surrounding the camp, struggling to find food for their families with the aid that the government is offering.\n\n\u201CThe Lord has led us to a different type of ministry in these weeks. We are having great times of practical discipleship. We are praying, singing, and laughing in the midst of the crisis. The Lord is using our whole family to help the young people around us who have health issues, giving them basic medicines and advice, tutoring in school subjects, providing food, and most importantly, teaching them to give their lives over to the Lord and trust in Him, even when the times seem dark.\n\nTogether, we are worshipping the Lord for His greatness and for His love, care, and provision. This allows us to share with the neediest and to be examples to them of brotherhood and the love of God.\u201D\n\u2022\nYou can read more from Cristóbal and other partners from Central America in our August Newsletter on our website.\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n#teamtuesday #centralamerica #latinamerica #centralamerican #covid19 #covid #coronoavirus #newlife #newlife #newlifeinchrist #newlife #pandemic #pandemic2020 #evangelist #evangelizing #evangelize #scripturebooklets #sharethegospel #spreadthegospel #christian #evangelism #ministry #godsword #praying #goodgod #evangelize #mission #global #worldmissionarypress #wmpress","NumberOfLikes":9,"Hashtags":["#teamtuesday","#centralamerica","#latinamerica","#centralamerican","#covid19","#covid","#coronoavirus","#newlife","#newlife","#newlifeinchrist","#newlife","#pandemic","#pandemic2020","#evangelist","#evangelizing","#evangelize","#scripturebooklets","#sharethegospel","#spreadthegospel","#christian","#evangelism","#ministry","#godsword","#praying","#goodgod","#evangelize","#mission","#global","#worldmissionarypress","#wmpress"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by World Missionary Press on August 11, 2020.

I had decided to settle there for a few years. For everyone who knows me knows that Barcelona is one of my absolute favorite cities. After working and studying for so many years, I felt it was time to try something new. I was scared at first because of my burnout, depression and anxiety but felt I needed to challenge myself and just enjoy my life. Said and done. Took my pick and pack and lived in my favorite city for six months. Six months of which three months in quarantine. I would be lying if I said that my soul didn\u2019t feel well during those six months. I felt so good. Due to the pandemic, there was not much to do in the city I dreamed of living in for so many years but the atmosphere made me forget all the worries and injustices in my life and the whole world. After many ifs and buts, I decided to move back home to Sweden again and forget about my nice trip. I felt I could not enjoy while people were dying. Called my boss after 2 weeks of self-isolation and decided to jump in and work again as an assistant nurse at the hospital. If there was one thing I wanted to remember about this time and this year, it was saving lives during the pandemic and not my time in isolation despite the nice weather or my tan in the sun. So here i am working as a assistant nurse and been doing it the whole summer #barcelona","NumberOfLikes":205,"Hashtags":["#barcelona"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Marwa Karim on August 11, 2020.

Literally it works as wonder. \n\n📌As her school has started through online, I always sit beside her during her online class. I also sing nursery rhymes, draw pictures, do exercise and play with her. She reminds me of my childhood and the energy & happiness I had then. Her joy, creativity and imagination during learning new things gives me immense pleasure in my life. \n\n📌Everyday I try to take her in the rooftop in late afternoon so that we can enjoy our time in the fresh air. Her happiness gets doubled when she can see different shades of color, different types of clouds, birds and kites in the sky. She also love to see colorful flowers in the rooftop garden. \n\n📌Another favourite time of us is story telling time before sleeping at almost every night. I use to tell her story of my all time favourite character like Mogli, Elsa, Moana, Meena, Sinbad and even Harry Potter. I also lost myself in the imagination of story line with her.\n\nIt's really hard to be depressed when I'm with her. When she keeps me occupied, I can feel the purpose of my life.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#pandemic2020 #pandemicmentalhealth #pandemiclife😷 #thisismotherhood #muslimparenting #mommymoments #girlsmom  #workingmoms #workingmomlife #motherhoodjourney #motherhood_squares #storytellingmama","NumberOfLikes":48,"Hashtags":["#pandemic2020","#pandemicmentalhealth","#pandemiclife😷","#thisismotherhood","#muslimparenting","#mommymoments","#girlsmom","#workingmoms","#workingmomlife","#motherhoodjourney","#motherhood_squares","#storytellingmama"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":16,"Timestamp":1597156290,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 11 16:31:30 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"It\u2019s that simple.

But then, this pandemic happened and the whole world as we know it is not fully prepared for the changes we are experiencing now. It seems that life will never be the same again. \n\nFor some who were greatly affected by the pandemic, life may seem to go downward spiral, one might feel they\u2019re stuck in a rut or immersed in a deep funk. Many plans or goals were changed or postponed. The things that appear to be working and have a chance to succeed before are not the case this time. \n\nI think life wants to teach us a lesson, that we need some kind of wake up call in this deep slumber. Let this period in our life be an opportunity instead to adapt to the situation and endure all the adversities life has in store for us. We need to stop being complacent and demand more from ourselves, that we have our mind and will to work for us, not against us. \n\nIf we desire for a successful career, material things, and other preferred indigents before, now that the table has turned, I think what we need to strive for now is a strength of character and clarity that we can get something and get through all of this.\n\nI saw this from Pinterest and I can't stop myself to replicate a copy of this art and to express the feeling of what's occurring now especially amidst the pandemic.\n\n#upsidedown #pandemic2020 #turnedupsidedown #changesthisyear #artsy #artattack #artoftheday #igart #instaart #arteveryday #beginnerartist #beginnerartwork #artpower #artisticph #artsyguy #artistoninstagram #drawingart #illustration #artwork #handdrawnart #artistsoninstagram #instaart #drawings #visualart #artistph #artoftheday #pencildrawing #pandemicistotallyreal","NumberOfLikes":70,"Hashtags":["#upsidedown","#pandemic2020","#turnedupsidedown","#changesthisyear","#artsy","#artattack","#artoftheday","#igart","#instaart","#arteveryday","#beginnerartist","#beginnerartwork","#artpower","#artisticph","#artsyguy","#artistoninstagram","#drawingart","#illustration","#artwork","#handdrawnart","#artistsoninstagram","#instaart","#drawings","#visualart","#artistph","#artoftheday","#pencildrawing","#pandemicistotallyreal"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Jae Roger on August 11, 2020.

This is a community that is invested heavily in the tourism trade, despite its relatively remote location. Like other tourist destinations, Victoria reacted swiftly during the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic, recognizing the economic threat that loomed on the horizon. Gone are its massive cruise ships and international passengers; instead, the city is catering to local and regional Canadians seeking a homegrown experience rather than travelling abroad. \n\nTo improve social distancing, Government Street in Victoria's Old Town district has been closed to vehicle traffic, creating a new pedestrian mall that has seen cafés and restaurants spill into the street for safer al fresco dining. Tourist shops have devoted space to selling groceries and everyday essentials for locals and visitors, reducing the need to travel to larger supermarkets. The end result is a walkable, community-focused city that has some local officials pondering which changes can be made permanent beyond 2020. Although British Columbia was an early COVID-19 hotspot in Canada, diligent social distancing measures, hand washing and frequent mask usage have led to a dramatic drop in new cases - promising a swifter return to normalcy for this idyllic province.\n\nThis is the final part of our series that features Canadian communities from coast-to-coast-to-coast, highlighting their unique pandemic experiences.\n\nPhoto: Victoria, British Columbia\nCredit: Jasper Garratt\n\n#covid19 #covid #coronavirus #virus #pandemic #quarantine #quarantinelife #canada #transcanada #pandemic2020 #2020 #bc #britishcolumbia #victoria #victoriabc #yyj #vancouverisland #chinatown #urbanphotography #urban #oldtown #alley #canadian #street #streetphotography #citylife #cityphotography #cityscape #city #tourism","NumberOfLikes":19,"Hashtags":["#covid19","#covid","#coronavirus","#virus","#pandemic","#quarantine","#quarantinelife","#canada","#transcanada","#pandemic2020","#2020","#bc","#britishcolumbia","#victoria","#victoriabc","#yyj","#vancouverisland","#chinatown","#urbanphotography","#urban","#oldtown","#alley","#canadian","#street","#streetphotography","#citylife","#cityphotography","#cityscape","#city","#tourism"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Respondkits on August 10, 2020.

Pluto = death and rebirth, wealth, shadow, the underworld, power, control, compulsion. If you\u2019ve been paying attention you\u2019ll remember that squares are areas of tension in astrology.  We have reached a face off between Mars and Pluto. The moon in Taurus today also adds stubbornness and resistance to change.

It struck me that it sat in the same spot for days in a row. I don't think it ever moved. I tried to feed it at the Pantai but it did not eat. Considering that it was unusually cold at night maybe down to 20°C at times I wondered how it would keep warm being so tiny.\n\nFinally I decided to take it back with me as I couldn't stand the thought anymore how it sat there alone, hungry and most likely cold.\nIt also cried a lot. \n\nEven if it would not live it was better to have it die in some comfort. \n\nSo I gave it the name Francis - a name that applies to both genders not knowing if it was female or male - and named it after 'Francis of Assisi' as he would have taken care of it. 🤍🕊️\n\nIt felt quite happy in the box with the towel and some company. \n\nBut it died peacefully in its sleep the next morning about the same time as Lemon.\n \nI did contemplate on the timing and thought it appeared maybe just to be a travel companion for Lemon for his last passage. \nHow long it survived! \n\nR.I.P. ✝️ little kitten ❤️🕊️\n\nTuesday, 4th August 2020\nWednesday, 5th August 2020\n\n#lonekitten #cats #kitten #pantaijasi #jasribeach #jasri #allmyanimals#myjourneytotheeast #myjourney #karangasem #eastbali #bali\n#theneverendingstory #covid19 #pandemic2020 #thedodo","NumberOfLikes":23,"Hashtags":["#lonekitten","#cats","#kitten","#pantaijasi","#jasribeach","#jasri","#allmyanimal","#myjourneytotheeast","#myjourney","#karangasem","#eastbali","#bali","#theneverendingstory","#covid19","#pandemic2020","#thedodo"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":2,"Timestamp":1597081960,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 10 19:52:40 CEST 2020","Location":"Pantai Jasri"},{"CaptionText":"▪︎▪︎▪︎\n2020 vibes\n▪︎\nBut for real, keep hopeful.

A comunidade cientifica ainda não confirmou que casos de reinfecção possam acontecer nessas situação. Porém, ainda devido a falta de conhecimento sobre alguns aspectos da doença, infectologistas afirmam que é preciso estar atento para avaliar essa possivel reinfecção.\n\nHá centenas de casos de reinfecção confirmados pelas autoridades de saúde da Coreia do Sul, em abril, mas, após cuidadosa avaliação, concluíram que esses casos de reinfecção seria provavelmente resultado de fragmentos inativos do vírus, ainda presente nos pacientes.\n\nCasos isolados de possível reinfecção que aparecem no território brasileiro podem ser explicados através de diferentes motivos ou causas. Uma delas é que, após a infecção sintomatica do COVID, esse paciente não tenha se recuperado totalmente, não apresentando sintomas e, após certo tempo, possivelmente devido a imunidade, esses sintomas novamente retorne. \n\nOutra causa é a assertividade dos testes realizados, podendo ser apresentado tanto falso negativo quanto falso positivo. Nesse caso, poderia ser melhor explicado se o sistema imune do paciente mantem o vírus a níveis que impeçam os testes de identifica-lo. Dessa forma, pode-se ter uma alteração no resultado do teste. \n\nPorém é ainda necessário aguardar melhores definições da comunidade cientifica e médica, já que os coronavírus de resfriados comuns podem provocar uma memória curta de defesa do organimo. Essa memória curta está associada a produção de anticorpos por apenas 6 a 12 meses subsequentes. Como o vírus #sarscov2 também é um coronavírus, a possibilidade de reinfecção poderá ocorrer nesse período de tempo, porém não confirmado ainda por dados clinicos e estatisticos confiáveis. \n\n🧬🧪👩\u200D⚕️👩\u200D🔬\n#pandemia #pandemic2020 #nanochemtechsolutions #nanochemtech #healthy #healthtech #startup #healthtechstartup","NumberOfLikes":19,"Hashtags":["#sarscov2","#covid19.","#sarscov2","#pandemia","#pandemic2020","#nanochemtechsolutions","#nanochemtech","#healthy","#healthtech","#startup","#healthtechstartup"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":3,"Timestamp":1597072235,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 10 17:10:35 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"#selfie #pandemic2020 #wearamask #weareinthistogether #blackandwhite","NumberOfLikes":0,"Hashtags":["#selfie","#pandemic2020","#wearamask","#weareinthistogether","#blackandwhite"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Travel-Food-Love on August 10, 2020.

Largely, the view was that, given the seriousness of what is going on, given the paralysis in the economy, and the desire for people to get back to work, we think there should be some sense of social responsibility, and if it really decreases the chance of infecting others and yourself, and if people agree universally to wear it, I think we should potentially convince the vast majority of the people to wear a mask. However, we can\u2019t force people to adopt behaviors in this country. Although, you can make it very uncomfortable for people who show up without masking because of social pressures.
