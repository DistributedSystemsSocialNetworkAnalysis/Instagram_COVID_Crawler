By definition there are 4 different types of distance: intimate (0-0.4m), personal (0.4-1.4m), social 1.4-3.5m) and public (>3.5m). In the \u2018Connected\u2019 installation at the @nxtmuseum your presence is projected as lines and shapes on the floor. You create patterns as you walk through the room and establish a network with others within the 4 types of distance we know. \n\nBefore COVID-19, day to day life distance between people flowed naturally. In 2020 we became aware of our distance which seems unnatural. Moving amongst each other seems as something that \u2018just happens\u2019. However, the projections of \u2018Connected\u2019 emphasizes the fact that we as humans are actually constantly communicating and collaborating while moving around from A to B. \u2018Distance\u2019 is far more complex than a measurable figure between persons. It is an emotional interaction. \n\nCool stuff!\n\nWe loved the sound design by Marc Mahfoud.

The U.S. Tax Code lets you deduct the interest you pay on your mortgage, your property taxes, and some of the costs involved in buying a home.\n2️\u20E3 EQUITY. Money paid for rent is money that you\u2019ll never see again, but mortgage payments let you build equity ownership interest in your home.\n3️\u20E3\tPREDICTABILITY. Unlike rent, your fixed-rate mortgage payments don\u2019t rise over the years so your housing costs may actually decline as you own the home longer. However, keep in mind that property taxes and insurance costs will likely increase.\n4️\u20E3 FREEDOM. The home is yours. You can decorate any way you want and choose the types of upgrades and new amenities that appeal to your lifestyle.\n5️\u20E3 STABILITY. Remaining in one neighborhood for several years allows you and your family time to build long-lasting relationships within the community. It also offers children the benefit of educational and social continuity.\n\nIf you have additional questions about the home buying process, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out . 📲 ✅\nTalk soon & happy home buying!!! 🏡\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n#openhouse #Louisville #Kentucky #homesforsale #Shepherdsville #buyingahome #tips #realtors #love #thanks #thankful #habloespañol #true #mustknow #kellerwilliams #KW #kwrealty #MtWashington #Taylorsville #SocialDistance #StayAtHome #coffee #Shepherdsville #Veterans","NumberOfLikes":3,"Hashtags":["#openhouse","#Louisville","#Kentucky","#homesforsale","#Shepherdsville","#buyingahome","#tips","#realtors","#love","#thanks","#thankful","#habloespañol","#true","#mustknow","#kellerwilliams","#KW","#kwrealty","#MtWashington","#Taylorsville","#SocialDistance","#StayAtHome","#coffee","#Shepherdsville","#Veterans"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by America\u2019s Home Team in America's Home Team, with KW Louisville.

I don't know for how long this will go on, but research is pretty clear regarding the psychological and health effects of long-term social isolation. Depression and loneliness are perhaps the most immediate and easier to observe results of distancing kids from school and peers. \n\nBut there is much more going on.\nStudies like the one below, find that kids experiencing social isolation have higher levels of inflammation 40 years later. Similar studies in adults show a higher risk for health problems, including cardiovascular disease. Inflammation is now considered the biological basis for chronic disease. \n\nSo, when\/if the new waves of lockdowns hit, make sure you create as many interactive moments you can for your family. If you have 2 or more kids, it's hardly a problem, but for families with just one child, this is definitely more challenging. Just keep the facts in mind and make informed decisions for the overall wellbeing of your family.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0306453014003126\n\n\u2026\n#primalbaby #toxictruth #toxictruths #inflammation #socialisolation #isolation #social #childisolation #socialdistance #lockdown #toxin #psycologicaltoxin  #depression #fightdepression #loneliness #interaction #letkidsplay #healthykids #thrivingkids #nontoxichome #nontoxicliving #nontoxiclife #primal #naturalbaby #naturalbabycare #greenhome #ecohome #greenchild #naturalparenting #naturalparent","NumberOfLikes":2,"Hashtags":["#primalbaby","#toxictruth","#toxictruths","#inflammation","#socialisolation","#isolation","#social","#childisolation","#socialdistance","#lockdown","#toxin","#psycologicaltoxin","#depression","#fightdepression","#loneliness","#interaction","#letkidsplay","#healthykids","#thrivingkids","#nontoxichome","#nontoxicliving","#nontoxiclife","#primal","#naturalbaby","#naturalbabycare","#greenhome","#ecohome","#greenchild","#naturalparenting","#naturalparent"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by Primal Baby on August 28, 2020 tagging @primalbaby.

Ja sam uredu, ali vidim vijesti da medicinski radnici jedva stoje na nogama od umora zbog 212 ljudi koji su na bolnickom lijecenju u Hrvatskoj, epidemiolozi rade 24h dnevno zbog 2000 testova dnevno koji se rade na razini drzave, ljudi se uz kasalj hroptaje ruse po cesti, crkvama, restoranima, kaficima, grobarima se lopate usijale od kopanja grobova za sve umrle od COVIDA, ali hvala Svevisnjem na jednom mjestu se vise ne mozete zaraziti - u teretanama u Splitsko Dalmatinskoj zupaniji. Mjera zatvaranja teretana je bila nuzna jer u kolovozu je u teretanama toliko ljudi da ih vlasnici nogom guraju u teretanu da uspiju zatvoriti vrata. Opcepoznato je da ljeti, u 8. mjesecu svi stariji, kronicni bolesnici (za koje je COVID najopasniji) pohrle sa crkvenih liturgija gdje jedu dezinficirane hostije i piju iz posvecenih kaleza u teretane na Bench, a svi mladi sportasi koji inace treniraju se iz teretana prebace u crkvene klupe moliti se da ih Gospodin spasi od zaraze COVIDom. Tako je Stozer donio logicnu odluku i zatvorio teretane. Ova odluka spasit ce nemjerljiv broj ljudskih zivota koji ce sada umjesto u leglima zaraze moci sigurno putovati javnim prijevozom, partijati u klubovima, uzivati u kaficima i jesti u restoranima, moliti za oprost grijeha u crkvama.

Ik hoop dat de snelheid waarmee de huidige ontwikkeling gaat niet af zal doen aan de veiligheid van het vaccin. \n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nVoorlopig is de laatste post met uitleg over de huidige situatie rondom het coronavirus.

Ugh. Bleh. Are you tired of constantly getting changes to the back to school plan? Are you also tired of getting used to the new normal only to get the carpet ripped out from under you again? Are you mostly tired of being asked if you\u2019re tired of all this 2020 nonsense?\n\u2022\nMy heart aches and my stomach is in knots as the school year approaches. And honestly, that\u2019s pretty much standard for me even since I was a Kindergartner. I\u2019ve always been a Nervous Knelly 🤪 my heart has also been longing to be back in my favorite place. It wants to be getting ready to decorate, welcome, educate, and nurture through hands-on exploration and learning. \nI\u2019ve come to accept that I\u2019ll be back online in the fall for at least five months, possibly longer. It\u2019s the safest choice and while I\u2019m nervous for it I\u2019ve been grateful to not be fearing for illness, injury, or loss of human life due to COVID-19. \nBut today my governor announced that schools can reopen if they want to do so, which is a huge change from what he\u2019s been saying. As of now my district hasn\u2019t decided whether or not they\u2019ll change our plan, but I\u2019m really hoping they stick to remote learning and reevaluate in January. Just because we have low COVID numbers doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s gone. I\u2019d rather be miserable teaching online than be mourning the loss of a life that could have been saved if our leaders hadn\u2019t ignored science. This is not the responsibility of teachers to manage or to \u201Csuck up.\u201D I\u2019m praying hard about what I should do if we do change to in person or remote learning. Ugh, I dont know. I\u2019m just tired of being tired I guess.

I'm so thankful God's mercies start over daily! \r\n\r\nLong story short I started feeling really bad 7\/31 - it felt like the start of a really bad sinus infection but worse.  Started antibiotics but went & got retested for Covid & 8\/2 went to Urgent Care because I felt like I was under water - my ears where so clogged, chest was tight, a cough from hell, headache(8 days straight), my eyeballs even hurt, no voice or appetite but no \"temp\". 8\/2 as I was leaving UC my Covid results came back positive 😢! I was managing the symptoms at home for 2 weeks - off & on work during that time because the exhaustion\/brain fog was real & the other symptoms lingered & most days I sounded like Barry White 😬 until I wasn't managing them! Oh, I was retested 8\/13 (felt some better) & it came back negative (false negative btw). 8\/17 I developed the worse headache of my life & 8\/18 still had it so I went to the ER after a virtual visit with my  PCP. I spent 2 days in the hospital - tested again for Covid & came back positive still. They managed the headache, lung inflammation with breathing treatments (it felt like small kid had been standing on my chest for 2 weeks), etc. This experience has been super isolating!\r\n.\r\n.\r\nI'm so thankful I wasn't more sick than I was as so many have not been as lucky! This is real real folks & I have been really careful but it got me! I'm still not feeling 100% or quite myself (the fatigue 🥴) but my last week's pic vs. yesterday's tells me I'm on my way (the life is slowly starting to come back to my eyes)!\r\n.\r\n.\r\nPlease wear your mask, wash your hands for at least 20 secs & if you can't use hand sanitizer & make sure they are dry, & social distance! Don't listen to the politicians...go get tested if you've been exposed & if your are asymptomatic (40% of Covid spreaders are asymptomatic) & stay home until you get your results back!\r\n\r\nI'm so grateful for all my peeps who have helped me manage through this with daily check ins, groceries, food delivery, lifting spirts, etc.!!\r\n\r\n#covid_19 #maskup #washyourhands #socialdistance","NumberOfLikes":74,"Hashtags":["#TBT","#covid_19","#maskup","#washyourhands","#socialdistance"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by LaToya in Atlanta, Georgia.

There is no submission fee. The only requirements are to create a work of art that highlights the theme and have it ready for display in the gallery (Pam Miller Downtown Arts Center). This year's theme is trees---there is a map of specific  trees\/groupings in Lexington, KY that artists are asked to interpret. You do not have to live in Lexington to participate, but the trees that are the subjects of this year's gallery are in Lexington (see map in link) and you will need to drop off and pick up your art in Lexington. You can paint, you can sculpt, you can write poetry about a tree and put it in a frame. Make some jewelry, make something interactive (there was a painting with braille last year). Your creativity is really the limit.\n\nFor additional details, tree map, and submission form is here: lexingtonky.gov\/PaintByNature","NumberOfLikes":23,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":6,"Timestamp":1598550635,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 27 19:50:35 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"integrofoundation","CaptionText":"Felices de ayudar a nuestros hermanos caribeños en Haití con la lucha contra el COVID 💙 Ayúdanos a continuar nuestros esfuerzos en el #LinkInBio.\n\nHappy to help our Caribbean brothers and sisters in Haiti with their battle against COVID 🇭🇹 Please help us continue our relief efforts by donating at the #LinkInBio.\n\nRepost from @thirdwavevolunteers:\n\nThank you to @binance charity and @integrofoundation who donated 10,000 N95 masks as well as to The Center of Haitian Studies who helped ship these masks to hospitals in Haiti\n\n#ThirdWaveVolunteers\n#IntegroPR","NumberOfLikes":14,"Hashtags":["#LinkInBio.","#LinkInBio.","#ThirdWaveVolunteers","#IntegroPR"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1598550615,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 27 19:50:15 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"plattscomm","CaptionText":"The equipment cage and edit suites will be opening Monday 8\/31!\nMake sure to reserve your equipment and\/or suite in advance, and remember to use health and safety precautions while operating or using the shared spaces #wearamask #washyourhands #socialdistance\n\nTogether we can stay safe and produce amazing work! \n\n#plattscomm #producingmedia #sunyplattsburgh #communications #cardinalstrong","NumberOfLikes":32,"Hashtags":["#wearamask","#washyourhands","#socialdistance","#plattscomm","#producingmedia","#sunyplattsburgh","#communications","#cardinalstrong"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598549556,"LocalDate":"Thu Aug 27 19:32:36 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"ppeexpress","CaptionText":"It hasn't gone away! ⠀\nWe have to keep doing our part to ensure things go back to the way they used to be.
