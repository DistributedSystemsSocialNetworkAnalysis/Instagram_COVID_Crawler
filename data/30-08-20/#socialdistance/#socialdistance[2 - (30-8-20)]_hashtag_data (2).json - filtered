Kennedy High School (JFKHS), Okkodo High School (OHS), and two COVID-19 cases were identified at the GDOE headquarters in Tiyan. \n\nOn Wednesday, August 26, 2020, the GDOE confirmed that four additional employees tested positive for COVID-19. Three of the four were identified through contact tracing. The contact tracing effort is ongoing and close contacts of the confirmed cases will be contacted directly by DPHSS. \n\nA close contact is an individual who has come in face-to-face contact with a confirmed COVID-19 individual for at least 10 minutes or more and within six feet, or who has had direct contact with infectious secretions of the confirmed COVID-19 individual (e.g. being coughed on). \n\nAreas of the school campuses and GDOE district office have been identified for cleaning and disinfecting. Under the current executive order, GDOE employees are teleworking and will not have access to these areas until cleaning has been completed.\n\nFor the latest information on COVID-19, visit dphss.guam.gov or guamrecovery.com.

𝐒𝐞𝐭 𝐮𝐩 𝐚𝐧 𝐈𝐧𝐟𝐥𝐨𝐰 𝐏𝐥𝐚𝐧 - To avoid staff and customers crossing paths, place directional arrows and signs to direct people to stay on the left vs right side, and to designate doors for entry and exit.\u2063\n\u2063\n𝟐. 𝐑𝐞𝐯𝐢𝐞𝐰 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐨𝐧 𝐀𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝗪𝐨𝐫𝐤 𝐒𝐩𝐚𝐜𝐞 - Kitchen, Cafeteria, Elecators, Stairways, and Washrooms can experience congestion throughout the day. It\u2019s important to implement social distancing, one way directional paths, and a fixed occupancy limit in each space with a thorough cleaning schedule. For work spaces, make sure everyone is 2 meters apart at all times. Space out desks or stagger shifts.\u2063\n\u2063\n𝟑. 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐠𝐠𝐞𝐫 𝐒𝐡𝐢𝐟𝐭𝐬 & 𝐋𝐮𝐧𝐜𝐡 𝐁𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐤𝐬 - Staggering shifts can greatly reduce congestion in common spaces, and lack of personal space in day to day work areas. It also helps reduce employees risk on public transit during peak hours. Assigning lunch break times to various areas of the workplace will keep social distancing and capacity under control. \u2063\n\u2063\n𝟒. 𝐀𝐯𝐨𝐢𝐝 𝐋𝐚𝐫𝐠𝐞 𝐆𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬 - Do not have large boardroom meetings, parties or get togethers at any time. \u2063If you must, maintain social distance and wear masks.\n\u2063\n𝟓. 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐏𝐥𝐞𝐱𝐢𝐠𝐥𝐚𝐬𝐬 𝐁𝐚𝐫𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐫𝐬 𝗪𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐍𝐞𝐞𝐝𝐞𝐝 - This is especially handy if you work face to face with customers, or cannot properly social distance at work. \u2063\n\u2063\n𝟔.

We called Agapé Hospice on a Friday, and within 30 minutes of our call a social worker came to our house, interviewed us and evaluated mom\u2019s needs and put a plan into place immediately. Within 2 hours a hospital bed, oxygen, and medications were delivered to our house. Within 4 hours a nurse had come to check on mom and to help answer any questions we had. The next day a doctor came to meet and evaluate mom and to assure us that we were doing everything we could. I can\u2019t say enough nice things about Agapé\u2019s services and support.

Tudo isso, naturalmente, perfeitamente seguindo os protocolos de segurança. Ouvir a orquestra afinando foi emocionante; ouvir os primeiros compassos da obra tocados pela orquestra, então! Da mesma forma que o sol de hoje veio aquecer um pouco as nossas esperanças, foi assim que o meu dia começou: confiante de que a arte sempre resiste a tudo. 🧡✨🎶 \n\nobrigada meu amor @umbelino6 pelo click e pelo olhar tão amoroso e cuidadoso 🍀\n\n#art #quarentine #socialdistance #opera #operasinger #operasingersofinstagram #soprano #happy","NumberOfLikes":219,"Hashtags":["#art","#quarentine","#socialdistance","#opera","#operasinger","#operasingersofinstagram","#soprano","#happy"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Raquel Paulin on August 25, 2020.

It is not inherited. And oftentimes, greatness isn't appreciated or recognised until you see greatness anywhere no more\u2063.\n\u2063\n🤫The secret of greatness lies within you. There is no discrimination from God. Anybody can be great. You have the formula of greatness inside you. It depends on you if you want to be great. If you want to be great, you can be great.\u2063\n\u2063\nThat secret recipe of greatness is inside you. There are so many souls inside you. Nothing is out of your reach. When you reach God, you will be at the pinnacle of your journey. That is the culmination.\u2063\n\u2063\nGreatness is not inherited.\u2063\n\u2063\n👨\u200D✈️ If your father is a pilot, do you assume you will be a pilot all by yourself, without any training or education? If your father is a great batsman, do you think you'll be a great batsman without making any effort? Why then do people think that if the father is a saint of God, then the son or daughter will be a saint of God too?\u2063\n\u2063\n❤️You will be a saint of God if God wants you to be his friend. It depends on God and you. Your family is not involved; the decision is taken by God. If God is willing, he will accept you as a friend. \u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n#ALRATV #GoharShahi #YounusAlGohar #sufi #sufism #agapelove #saint #fate #divinelove #lovequotes #divine #purification #compassion #greatness #selfesteem #selfimprovement #creation #Nirvana #higherself #theself #happiness #motivation #UniversalSufi #hope #socialdistance #hope #strength #positiveenergy #enlightenment #evolve","NumberOfLikes":8,"Hashtags":["#ALRATV","#GoharShahi","#YounusAlGohar","#sufi","#sufism","#agapelove","#saint","#fate","#divinelove","#lovequotes","#divine","#purification","#compassion","#greatness","#selfesteem","#selfimprovement","#creation","#Nirvana","#higherself","#theself","#happiness","#motivation","#UniversalSufi","#hope","#socialdistance","#hope","#strength","#positiveenergy","#enlightenment","#evolve"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Spiritual on August 25, 2020.

It is not inherited. And oftentimes, greatness isn't appreciated or recognised until you see greatness anywhere no more\u2063.\n\u2063\n🤫The secret of greatness lies within you. There is no discrimination from God. Anybody can be great. You have the formula of greatness inside you. It depends on you if you want to be great. If you want to be great, you can be great.\u2063\n\u2063\nThat secret recipe of greatness is inside you. There are so many souls inside you. Nothing is out of your reach. When you reach God, you will be at the pinnacle of your journey. That is the culmination.\u2063\n\u2063\nGreatness is not inherited.\u2063\n\u2063\n👨\u200D✈️ If your father is a pilot, do you assume you will be a pilot all by yourself, without any training or education? If your father is a great batsman, do you think you'll be a great batsman without making any effort? Why then do people think that if the father is a saint of God, then the son or daughter will be a saint of God too?\u2063\n\u2063\n❤️You will be a saint of God if God wants you to be his friend. It depends on God and you. Your family is not involved; the decision is taken by God. If God is willing, he will accept you as a friend. \u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n#ALRATV #GoharShahi #YounusAlGohar #sufi #sufism #agapelove #saint #fate #divinelove #lovequotes #divine #purification #compassion #greatness #selfesteem #selfimprovement #creation #Nirvana #higherself #theself #happiness #motivation #UniversalSufi #hope #socialdistance #hope #strength #positiveenergy #enlightenment #evolve","NumberOfLikes":15,"Hashtags":["#Repost","#ALRATV","#GoharShahi","#YounusAlGohar","#sufi","#sufism","#agapelove","#saint","#fate","#divinelove","#lovequotes","#divine","#purification","#compassion","#greatness","#selfesteem","#selfimprovement","#creation","#Nirvana","#higherself","#theself","#happiness","#motivation","#UniversalSufi","#hope","#socialdistance","#hope","#strength","#positiveenergy","#enlightenment","#evolve"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598373162,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 18:32:42 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"thebaewhisperer","CaptionText":null,"NumberOfLikes":580,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":19,"Timestamp":1598373089,"LocalDate":"Tue Aug 25 18:31:29 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"Owner":"supperandsoiree","CaptionText":"Happy Tuesday My Darlings!!!\nI cannot believe that we are already one week away from the Fall season.

It is not inherited. And oftentimes, greatness isn't appreciated or recognised until you see greatness anywhere no more\u2063.\n\u2063\n🤫The secret of greatness lies within you. There is no discrimination from God. Anybody can be great. You have the formula of greatness inside you. It depends on you if you want to be great. If you want to be great, you can be great.\u2063\n\u2063\nThat secret recipe of greatness is inside you. There are so many souls inside you. Nothing is out of your reach.

People - PLEASE, PLEASE listen to experts and believe that the Corona Virus exists and wearing a mask can help save lives and prevent the after affects of its wrath on your body after being exposed. This here is my youngest son, who tested positive for the Virus back in June. He had fever, bad body aches, headaches, lost of smell and taste. He had symptoms close to 4 weeks before getting a negative test result. Although he thought he recovered, but the side effects are continuous - low energy, what seems to be nerve damage and now his lung has collapsed possibly due to damage by the Virus! 😭😭 He will be ok and was fortunate that he was able to get to the hospital on time to be treated immediately 🙏. So, before you get restless about our lives as it is happening now, the closures of stores, the having to wear masks, the constant washing of your hands, being told not to be in large groups, no large family gatherings etc, think about something like this and how it can permanently change your life or worse yet, someone you love can lose theirs out of YOUR irresponsibility! Because of this Virus, I am not allowed to be with him and he is alone having to experience this 😭😭😡. For those who think it can't happen to you, it can!

I packed up a few things and was fortunate to be able to indefinitely move into my mom\u2019s home nearby. This was a scary, frustrating and very anxious experience. Today, we were grateful to be informed that everyone tested negative and is healthy! I\u2019ll be able to move back home at the end of the week, and get back to business as usual. \n.\nIt was very hard after all the sacrifices Daniel and I have made to stay safe - we are the strictest people we know - that someone else put our *whole world* at risk because they decided a pandemic was a good time for out-of-state visitors and road trip vacations.
