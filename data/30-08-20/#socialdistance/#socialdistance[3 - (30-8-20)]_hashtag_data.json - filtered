And this post is going to be very personal( kinda journal entry🙈) \n.\nWhy I took a break?\nSuddenly last week I noticed that I was getting too addicted to Instagram and I couldn\u2019t stop refreshing the page again and again to see what\u2019s new happening there. Stalking some random pages, getting excited when people uploaded something new. And after that I started worrying about my social performance. Self-criticism hit hard on me. That was really really not healthy for me(for you also) \nAlways remember that a part of social media is not real. \nThen I realised that I needed a break from all this. I went a step ahead to delete the app( now understand the level of addiction!😂)\nIn these five days, I did all the things to ease my mind and body. I challenge myself to do all the things without posting it as insta stories 😂🙈\nReading novels, listening to podcasts, \nReading about young entrepreneurs , Writing journals, listening to music, I even noticed my water intake 😂 \n.\n.\nWhy I\u2019m saying all these here is, you should manage your insta acc and don\u2019t let the insta acc to manage you...\nWhenever you feel like taking a break, plz do take!! (Don\u2019t worry about the followers count)\nBreak is necessary! Don\u2019t get overwhelmed by social media. \nThis is not real. \nRefreshing the computer(human body) is very very essential for a good run ♥️\n.\n.\n.\nMental health matters more than social media engagements. \n.\n.\n.\nStay safe♥️\n.\n.\n.\n#mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #mentalillness #socialmedia #socialdistance #socialmediadetox #socialmediadetoxing #creators #bloggerslife #chennaiinfluencer #chennaifashionblogger #chennaifashionbloggers #chennaiblogger #coimbatoreblogger #coimbatorefashionblogger #southindianblogger #southindian #staysafe","NumberOfLikes":178,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by 𝒀𝒖𝒗𝒂𝒔𝒓𝒊 𝑺𝒓𝒊𝒏𝒊𝒗𝒂𝒔𝒂𝒏 ✨ on August 24, 2020.

As many of you are aware, I hadn\u2019t left my house (apart from the occasional car ride to nowhere & one road trip to see the same two people I\u2019ve been seeing since June \u2014 my mom & sister) in six months. Saturday night, my sister rented out a movie theater so we could watch Harry Potter & the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone, alone. (It wasn\u2019t too pricey at all, by the way!) Seriously, it was just my husband, my sister, & myself. We watched a movie we\u2019ve seen a hundred times. We were by ourselves. We ate popcorn & drank soda that were unnecessarily expensive. It felt like I got some normalcy back, except for the mask-wearing, frequent washing of the hands, hand-sanitizing, remaining six-feet away from people I wasn\u2019t usually with, & legit flushing the public restroom toilet with my shoe (because I was not about to touch that nastiness with my hand). I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t have at least a few anxiety attacks as we pulled into the parking lot or while we made our way through the main lobby of the theater, but it felt good to get out a bit. Now, we\u2019re headed back to our home in New York, four hours away, where I\u2019ll remain until Rosh Hashana (the Jewish New Year) gets here. This little trip really did wonders for me.\n_\n\nCaptured by @remnantsofbrit.","NumberOfLikes":97,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo shared by BRIT COHEN on August 24, 2020 tagging @westelm, @acolorstory, @amazonhome, and @remnantsofbrit.

I\u2019m so thankful for guests who are respectful of all comfort levels, and follow guidelines to ensure the continued health of myself, my family and eachother. it\u2019s thanks to folks like them that we can all find some joy in #2020. \n.\n✨\n#bemindful #socialdistance #careaboutothers #loveoneanother #berespectful #hazeljbow #foodismedicine #yogaismedicine #oceanmedicine #beachmedicine","NumberOfLikes":31,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1598208468,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 20:47:48 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"𝘖𝘯𝘦 𝘛𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘞𝘰𝘶𝘭𝘥 𝘏𝘢𝘷𝘦 𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘍𝘳𝘶𝘪𝘵 \n𝘔𝘶𝘴𝘵 𝘊𝘭𝘪𝘮𝘣 𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘛𝘳𝘦𝘦.\n\n#staysafe #safety_first #staycare #socialdistance\n#instalike #goodvibes #Zipline #treeclimbing\n#igersfrance #nature #sky #shoutout #igersbretagne #peekthures #photography #quote #photooftheday #picoftheday #instagood #passionphoto #capturingmoments #bestoftheday #simplething #shoootpost\n#JustAGoodShot #tree #viewpoint #photographyislife #ρнσтɢяαρнɛяℓιғɛ","NumberOfLikes":553,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by ᴘᴇᴇᴋᴛʜᴜʀᴇs ᴘʜᴏᴛᴏɢʀᴀᴘʜʏ in Adrénature.

The truck was the best route, as opposed to a buffet-style set-up, because we could control the amount of people touching the serving utensils. \n\nTheir ceremony was done virtually so their loved ones who couldn\u2019t travel, could attend. Their entire reception was done via Zoom and it was all ok, folks. \n\nThose that lived here headed over to Whittier Cafe afterwards to enjoy the socially distanced patio and there was so much love!\n\nWe set up their tablecloths, floral arrangements and even got to put together their dessert display, complete with their own customized hand sanitizer bottle from our friends over at @thezeromarket ❤️\n\nLove is still in the air.

A very balanced and nicely executed pasta👍🏼 The pâté en croûte is the extra dish I order on top of the set menu as I just miss this hearty and homey piece too much🥺The sourdough with signature spread, choux pastry and canelé are perfect as always that I consistantly want them to open a pastry🍞 stall so that I do not always have to look out for my breakfast ☀️\n\nLastly, I would like to thank MO for the most on-point service and the amazing valet for the delivery. It is truly a 5-star experience. Or should I say 6-star😎\n- - - - -\n📍Louise (Delivery @ Mandarin Oriental)\nG\/F, JPC, PMQ, 35 Aberdeen Street, Central\n- - - - -\n#afoodstagramm_central\n#afoodstagramm_louise\n#afoodstagramm_michelin\n#DISHTAGXJIA","NumberOfLikes":159,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":12,"Timestamp":1598179170,"LocalDate":"Sun Aug 23 12:39:30 CEST 2020","Location":"Louise"},{"CaptionText":"The maximum temperature is around 27℃, the humidity is around 90% and the wind speed from south east is 1m\/s in Chiba today.

FLAW even started the #ProtectTheVulnerable campaign to help encourage everyone to stay home and help keep those populations safe. But this narrative quickly changed as communities of color were disproportionately affected, children and teenagers became sick, celebrities lost their lives and now as the United States\u2019 cases have doubled in six weeks to over 4 million - one thing has become clear: WE ARE ALL VULNERABLE. \u2063\u2063⠀\n\u2063\u2063⠀\nAt Fight Like A Warrior we believe it is time to come together (metaphorically of course 😉) and wear our masks not for the good of one person or population, but because our nation and world will never get to heal if we do not. \u2063\u2063⠀\n\u2063\u2063⠀\nOne person dies of COVID-19 in the U.S. alone about every 80 seconds . Fellow non-profit coalition parters, doctors, nurses, teachers, chronic illness warriors, and more are coming together to take part in #WeAreAllVulnerable and pledge to wear a mask.\u2063⠀\n\u2063⠀\nJOIN US: \u2063⠀\n\u2063\u2063⠀\n1. Take the digital pledge to wear a mask at fightlikeawarrior.org\/weareallvulnerable 🖊\u2063\u2063⠀\n\u2063⠀\n2. Use campaign graphics and\/or printable signs to create your own social media post and spread the word! Use #WeAreAllVulnerable and tag @fightlikeawarrior ✅\u2063\u2063⠀\n\u2063⠀\n3. Nominate 2 friends or family members to take the pledge and get involved! 👥\u2063\u2063⠀\n\u2063\u2063⠀\nSwipe for more information, directions to take the pledge, to join the campaign, and to help put a stop to illness and death from this preventable disease.

This 'walk' was only 6km but my goodness it was impressive. I'd noted some waterfalls marked on a map opposite a popular walking spot, so I looked for an appropriate track to see if I could get in and have a look. Well, I found the track and bashed my way in (it was petty overgrown) and got the chance to walk up alongside this amazing river. \n\nThis is Little River (one of 3 Little Rivers I know of in Victoria). The river has a funny sort of path. It travels in a shallow valley about 1,000m above sea level and then turn left. As it turns it progressively drops around 500m over a distance of maybe 5km. In the middle of winter the tall hills and mountains east of Melbourne capture storms and showers and then funnels them into fast moving rivers. During the wetter months the racing white water puts on a dramatic show of force.\n\n#igaustralia #hikeon  #explorethemountains #hikerforlife #trailhiking #trailhikingaust #victoriawalks #bushwalkingvictoria #isolation #socialdistance #parksvictoria #cathedralranges #taungurungcountry #cathedralrangesstatepark #discoverdindi","NumberOfLikes":118,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Deano the Weekend Wanderer in Cathedral Range State Park.

The first Atlanta Food & Film Fridays with Ashlee. 😛🤩\n.\nLast night, I picked up from one of my faves Beetlecat ; however, my new self discipline was in full force and I did not get the coconut creme pie. It was hard. I did however get the tuna tartare that has made its way back on the menu. Honestly, very few things are as good take out as in the restaurant; but in general their tuna tartare is one of my faves, and I think it\u2019s the sesame crackers that make it. They did not disappoint. I also got the ginger salad, and I think it\u2019s my favorite ginger salad dressing. I had left overs from the salad that I will eat with dinner tonight. Easy to grab curbside, at their outdoor walk up bar around back by the Den entrance. I paid over the phone, so it was grab and go. \n\nBefore grabbing my curbside take out, I popped into Vinoteca and asked for a dry Sauvignon blanc for under $20 and within 30 seconds, I had one in my hand. It\u2019s by Yllera and is from the Rueda region of Spain. Pretty good. P.S. you aren\u2019t allowed past the entryway.  They go and pull what you ask for, which is honestly easier with a pup in tow. They also had live music on their patio out front, which was really nice. They have tables set up outside if you want to partake in their wine tasting, which I know from personal experience are generous pours. 😬\n\nAnd for the film, drumroll please... it was The Little Tin Man which I\u2019ve been meaning to watch for the longest time, because my friend Aaron Beelner is the lead!! It\u2019s an indie flick, not filmed here, but Aaron is a local Atlanta actor. It was very charming and sweet, as well funny. It tells the story of Herman, a man with dwarfism, who wants people to see past his little stature and take him seriously as a man and actor. Bonus, Michael McGlone from  Brothers McMullen, Jeff Hiller who is freaking hilarious and Kay Cannon who wrote all three of the Pitch Perfect movies .  It was a band of misfits led by Aaron and I loved it! You can rent it for a few dollars on Vimeo. \n\nIf you have suggestions for next Friday, where once again I will drink too much wine by myself on my sofa, hit me up!","NumberOfLikes":48,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":13,"Timestamp":1598123305,"LocalDate":"Sat Aug 22 21:08:25 CEST 2020","Location":"Inman Park"},{"CaptionText":"🟢 𝐖𝐇𝐀𝐓\u2019𝐒 𝐘𝐎𝐔𝐑 𝐅𝐀𝐕𝐎𝐑𝐈𝐓𝐄 𝐈𝐓𝐄𝐌(𝐒)?

We value the time to be with our students, and views this summer as a meaningful one. Check how Dr. Andy Guth, from American University, feels about the summer 2020 online session. 👨🏼\u200D🏫\u2060\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\u2060\n\"As our semester comes to an end, I want to thank each and every one of you, students, staff, and faculty, for the extra work and dedication that made this summer session a success. The measure of an individual, or organization, is how one responds to adversity. I believe we have all responded well and is a credit to each individual. 2020 has presented, and will continue to present, challenges but also opportunities. Greater opportunities for online courses. Greater opportunities for long distance learning. Greater opportunities to learn more computer skills. And, perhaps, greater opportunities to spend more time with family. \u2060\nAs long as each of us continues to respond to these ongoing challenges in a similar manner to what we have so far, I believe we will all look back on this year as one of the most memorable years of our lives. If that is the case, and it likely is, then we should continue to strive to have those memories as ones of success in conquering challenges, memorable self-reflection for when future hardships arise in years and decades to come, and the importance of friends, family, and colleagues in helping each other overcome difficulty.\u2060\n\u2060\nThank you all again for coming together and rising to the challenge and making this summer session a great success. I, and the rest of the G-MEO team, look forward to hopefully having many of you in our Fall 2020 classes as well.\"\u2060\n\u2060\n-- Dr. Andy Guth, American University\u2060\n\u2060\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\u2060\n\u2060\n#summer2020 #onlineclass #gmeosummer #college #studyonline #summerstudy #summerplan #summerlife #collegemust #studyinus #summeronline #studyathome  #socialdistance #professor #teachingabroad #teachinginchina #teachinchina #faculty #americanuniversity #university #summerreview\u2060","NumberOfLikes":11,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by G-MEO | Study & Intern Abroad on August 22, 2020.

Nazvao sam doticnu te me je ona pokusala naci po prezimenu mog zarazenog kontakta, nakon sto nije uspjela pokusala je pretrazivati po imenu, nakon duzeg trazenja ustanovila je da je moj najblizi kontakt koji ima pozitivan test vec 3 dana u sustav unesen pod potpuno krivim prezimenom i 10g ranijim datumom rođenja. Znaci, tocno 7 dana nakon zaraze Koronavirusom smo mogli slobodno setati zemljom, da nas je netko zaustavio ne bi nas mogao pronaci u sustavu na popisu zarazenih i onih koji trebaju biti u samoizolaciji jer su imali u sustavu upisanu osobu s imenom i prezimenom te datumom rodjenja koja uopce ne postoji. Također, ljudi koji su bili u bliskom kontaktu s nama nisu poslani na testiranje niti im je određena mjera samoizolacije nego se mogu slobodno kretati, ali ne brinite, dovoljno su savjesni da se sami izoliraju iako im to epidemioloska sluzba nije propisala. Trenutno imamo 3 potvrđenih i sutra cu biti ja potvrđen, a realan broj direktno vjerojatno zarazenih od nas je barem 5x veci, samo sto ih nitko nije testirao niti to trazio od njih. Sto se tice simptoma, njih jednostavno nema, osjecam se bolje nego kada sam bio nezarazen, ali cu u kuci biti jos narednih 11 dana, lisen mogucnosti da zarađujem novce, treniram, zivim. Ja sam zatvoren, a na mene dolazi 20 zarazenih ljudi koji nikada nece biti niti testirani, nego ce zivjeti normalno kako smo ocito svi trebali od pocetka svega ovoga.","NumberOfLikes":909,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Kristijan Matković in Zagreb, Croatia.
