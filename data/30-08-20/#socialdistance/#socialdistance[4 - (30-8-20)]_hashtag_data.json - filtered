He developed the concept of Registrar General.\n* He developed the concept of treasury (Bait ul Maal). And he would spent on non Muslims as well from that.\n* He developed the system of taxing importing goods.\n* He decided in his time that coins should have specific weights which should be recorded and then used.\n* He in his leadership announced to never destroy a place of worship to those who are non Muslims.\n* He started the concept of Surveyor General basically. He surveyed and measured the lands and gave this idea to the Muslim world. \n\nMay Allah grant us his companionship in Jannat ul firdous!

The double patty beyond burger came with mustard, pickles, ketchup, and cheese then on the side they had onion, tomato, and lettuce. The tots were crispy which is how I like them. It came in the Bayside Tigers logo box with two commemorative gifts a pencil and two stickers. Photo ops were a lot less extravagant than a couple years ago when they were able to host a dine in Saved by the Bell experience. So it was understandable since they were following safety guidelines. I felt very safe and social distancing was followed. One bummer was we ordered two meals but only got one box and one gift set. It seems like if we are paying for two experience we should have gotten two sets of gifts. \n\nI believe there are still open slots online to reserve your pick up time. I suggest if going with others each do your own order so you each get the gifts. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t do another pop up pick up experience again just because it was a bit pricey for what is offered and I know how amazing the dine in experience is. But I would do a dine in experience again once it is safe to do so because the food is really good and they have lots of photo ops and memorabilia. \n\n#savedbythemax #savedbythebell #bayside #la #hollywood #beldingapproved #beyond #beyondmeat #tigers #iamsoexcited #tots #popup #socialdistance #food #burgers #gobayside #preppy #nationalsavedbythebellday","NumberOfLikes":15,"Hashtags":["#savedbythemax","#savedbythebell","#bayside","#la","#hollywood","#beldingapproved","#beyond","#beyondmeat","#tigers","#iamsoexcited","#tots","#popup","#socialdistance","#food","#burgers","#gobayside","#preppy","#nationalsavedbythebellday"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597973240,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 03:27:20 CEST 2020","Location":"West Hollywood Gateway"},{"CaptionText":"New review added to IGTV and YouTube (Link in BIO)\n\n@omahabrewingcompany Social Distance IPA comes in at 7.5% ABV and is the perfect beer to enjoy when you're hanging out with friends both old and new!! \n\n#instabeerpics #weekenddrinks #smalltownbigbeers #ipa  #omahabrewingcompany #socialdistance #pandemicbeer #craftbeerreviews #beerblog #craftbeersmatter #craftbeerguy #instacraftbeer","NumberOfLikes":11,"Hashtags":["#instabeerpics","#weekenddrinks","#smalltownbigbeers","#ipa","#omahabrewingcompany","#socialdistance","#pandemicbeer","#craftbeerreviews","#beerblog","#craftbeersmatter","#craftbeerguy","#instacraftbeer"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":0,"Timestamp":1597973002,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 03:23:22 CEST 2020","Location":"Omaha Brewing Company"},{"CaptionText":"Yum, dirt! 🌱\u2063🌭\n\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\n#thedoxiedex #dachshundsofinstagram #wienerdog #doxiesofinstagram #omahadachshund #nebraskadachshund #omahadoxie #doxiegram #stayhome #socialdistance @dogsofinstagram #doggosofomaha #dogtiktok #dogmodel #letsstayhome #backyardshenanigans #backyardplaying #play #dogsofmulhalls #mulhalls #plants #iloveplants #dirttastesgood","NumberOfLikes":37,"Hashtags":["#thedoxiedex","#dachshundsofinstagram","#wienerdog","#doxiesofinstagram","#omahadachshund","#nebraskadachshund","#omahadoxie","#doxiegram","#stayhome","#socialdistance","#doggosofomaha","#dogtiktok","#dogmodel","#letsstayhome","#backyardshenanigans","#backyardplaying","#play","#dogsofmulhalls","#mulhalls","#plants","#iloveplants","#dirttastesgood"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":4,"Timestamp":1597972969,"LocalDate":"Fri Aug 21 03:22:49 CEST 2020","Location":null},{"CaptionText":"La Paz - Bolivia\nCuarentena dinámica \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#lapaz  #Bolivia #documentaryphotography #photojournalism #freelance #social #people #streetphotography #dynamicsymmetry #fotografiadocumental #fotoperiodismo #fotoperiodismo #covid_19 #quarantine #quedateencasa #everydaycovid19 #everydaycoronavirus #everydayquarantine #covid19 #socialdistance #fotoperiodismoACPI\n#covid_bolivia #everydaybolivia #yourshotphotographer #LaCalleBoliviaPhoto #myqbb","NumberOfLikes":38,"Hashtags":["#lapaz","#Bolivia","#documentaryphotography","#photojournalism","#freelance","#social","#people","#streetphotography","#dynamicsymmetry","#fotografiadocumental","#fotoperiodismo","#fotoperiodismo","#covid_19","#quarantine","#quedateencasa","#everydaycovid19","#everydaycoronavirus","#everydayquarantine","#covid19","#socialdistance","#fotoperiodismoACPI","#covid_bolivia","#everydaybolivia","#yourshotphotographer","#LaCalleBoliviaPhoto","#myqbb"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Ivan Canedo in La Paz, Bolivia.

I had to remind students to not share their supplies, or get up out of their desk to go help a friend. All of these instincts kids have, and forcing them to resist them is the hardest part of all of this.... but once again, kids are amazing and can make the best of any situation. ____________________________________________________________\nLap desks are amazing for taking the classroom outside.

You have your routine, your team has gotten the hang of virtual meetings and you're finally starting to return to (maybe a small semblance?) of normalcy. However, you can\u2019t help but feel like you could be a bit more productive if just\u2026 and you can\u2019t put your finger on it. No fear! We were feeling that way over the past few months too and here are some items that have personally helped our team. ⠀\n⠀\n1️\u20E3. PORTABLE BATTERY BANK ⠀\nWe love our portable battery bank because it allows us to move from room-to-room without constantly having to find \u2014 or strenuously reach \u2014 for new outlets around our home. A change of scenery gets our motivated mindset on + we can\u2019t recommend being able to do this for your sanity enough! 🔋⠀\n⠀\n2️\u20E3. LAPTOP STAND⠀\nRealizing your back and neck hurts more than usual lately? Make sure the culprit of the pain isn\u2019t indeed just your posture while pouring over at your desk all day! We got an affordable laptop stand and it helps keep our back upright and our tech-neck far far away. 💻⠀\n⠀\n3️\u20E3. AIRPODS⠀\nWorking from home means, well, home sounds. Suddenly your dog starts barking uncontrollably at the delivery person, the construction outside is loud enough to reverberate through your windows and yes, even the subtle clink of your washing machine is driving you up-the-wall. Our solution: AirPods! Pop \u2018em in, turn on some calm music and work the day away in peace. 🎧⠀\n⠀\n4️\u20E3. PLANTS ⠀\nFun Fact: Bringing plants into an office space can increase productivity by up to 15%! We recently bought a few new plants to liven up our home offices and they definitely add a little extra \u201Coomph\u201D to the space. 🌿⠀\n⠀\n5️\u20E3. POSTER BOARD⠀\nGiant PostIt Note boards are genius for having on-hand so when you\u2019re inspired you can jot down your brilliant ideas. You can also use it to get creative with your employees on a Zoom Call \u2014 they\u2019re the perfect size for team pro\/con lists or strategy webs. 📌⠀\n⠀\nLet\u2019s all support each other with extra tips & tricks on how to stay productive working from home. 👇👇👇","NumberOfLikes":97,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Printed Mint | Wholesale on August 19, 2020.

Er zijn weer meer mensen die het virus hebben opgelopen en er zijn meer ziekenhuisopnames. Daarop heeft u weinig invloed, maar het is van groot belang om mee te nemen in uw risico-inschattingen. Bijvoorbeeld in Amsterdam zijn er veel besmettingen, het is verstandig om voorzichtiger te zijn in de gebieden met meer besmettingen. Zoals u ook in de spits past u ook uw rijgedrag aanpast, is het belangrijk om uw gedrag aan te passen op plekken waar de verspreiding van het virus hoger is. U moet dan simpelweg voorzichtiger zijn, en liever nog die plekken vermijden. Het dashboard op de website van het RIVM geeft deze informatie ook goed weer. \n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nU heeft wel veel invloed op factor 2, uw gedrag bepaalt u immers zelf. Dat is best een open deur, maar wel heel belangrijk om bij stil te staan. Hoe beter we begrijpen wat belangrijk is voor onze eigen gezondheid, hoe makkelijker we ons gedrag daarop aan zullen passen. Het advies, ook gisteren herhaald in de persconferentie luidt: houd je aan de maatregelen. \n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nOp factor 3 heeft u ook invloed, bijvoorbeeld met een gezonde leefstijl. Dat ligt iets ingewikkelder, ik kom er later op terug. \n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nTot slot zal u rekening houden met uw naaste omgeving. Wanneer u in huis leeft met iemand met een hoger risico op een ernstig beloop dan zal u ook voorzichtiger zijn dan wanneer alle mensen in uw huishouden jong, gezond en vitaal zijn.","NumberOfLikes":30,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":1,"Timestamp":1597820197,"LocalDate":"Wed Aug 19 08:56:37 CEST 2020","Location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands"}]
