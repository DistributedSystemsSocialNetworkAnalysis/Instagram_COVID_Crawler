Y más aún cuando no todos tienen consciencia de la realidad a la que nos estamos enfrentando. Si fuera que todos respetaran las reglas, pues todo bien, pero lamentablemente no siempre es así. Ciertamente esto no será para siempre, pero debemos ser más conscientes con nuestros actos, más objetivos, estar bien informados con fuentes confiables, hacerle caso a los profesionales de la salud que verdaderamente están comprometidos con que toda esta situación acabe, informarnos de quienes tienen el conocimiento empírico y comprobado. Para así, de esa manera poder actuar con mayor sabiduría y empatía ante toda esta situación. ¿Qué nos cuesta hacer el sacrificio ahora de protegernos correctamente? Para fiestas y visitas habrá tiempo después. No esperemos a que sea demasiado tarde y tengamos que lamentarnos para darnos cuenta.

We all are facing challenges and difficulties condensed into just a couple of months. I personally have seen acquaintances and family members pass away in the last six months and last Friday night an uncle of mine passed away. My family is devastated. It is never easy to say goodbye or to let go, it is even harder when you can\u2019t say goodbye through the rituals we perform to represent the ending of a life cycle, and coming to terms with the idea that you won\u2019t see your love ones again. With the current situation, we are force to create our own individual rituals to honor them so we can start our own process of grief, all this while trying to find connection and comfort through video calls with the people we care about. \n.\nTomorrow will mark six years since I arrived in New York. A lot has changed in the world, particularly in the USA and Colombia where I am from. But I wish more than ever that I was in Colombia right now with my family to be with them in this period of grief. \n .\nWear a mask, social distance and avoid parties, you can wait another year for that.

One suggested an opt-out call for mental health connections for teens. \u2009\u2009\n\u2009\u2009\n🤷\u200D♀️To share where parents should be getting the most up-to-date info. \u2009\u2009\n\u2009\u2009\n💉 To prepare for the rush for catch-up vaccines (I suspect a physician mom said this?)\u2009\u2009\n\u2009\u2009\n😳To share what to look out for more serious mental health concerns. \u2009\u2009\n\u2009\u2009\n🏫To advocate for their kid\u2019s safety with them at local school districts. \u2009\u2009\n\u2009\u2009\n👩🏻\u200D⚕️By and large, it seems folks are not getting the amount of communication that they need. In times of crisis, communication & over-communication is a leadership pearl. I feel like I get too many emails from the different health systems my kid\u2019s are seen at! \u2009\u2009\n\u2009\u2009\n🙌How would you like to get info from your Pediatricians - newsletters, apps, website updates, webinars and\/or social media? Comment below or answer in my stories tonight!\n\u2009\n✔️Also check out healthychildren.org which is the @ameracadpeds @healthychildrenaap website for great updates on all things pandemic. \u2009\n\u2009\u2009\n🎈Stay tuned, I will keep sharing what I can\/ when I can to help out the pre-teen & teenager crowd! \n#pediatrics #leadership #teen #teenhealth","NumberOfLikes":161,"Hashtags":["#pediatrics","#leadership","#teen","#teenhealth"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Hina Talib, MD | she\/her in New York, New York with @vickichanmd, @drlesliekim, @kckidsdoc, @the_mama_doc, @drlorashahine, @pedsdoctalk, @dr.amnahusain, and @babydocpatel.

In my time away, I have been keeping you all in my heart and prayers💛🙏🏼💛\nI have been Praying, Praying, Praying...Healing, Healing, Healing and getting restored and realigned! \n\nA year ago yesterday, we launched Heal Her Heart👸🏾 What a powerful experience it was with over 50 women embracing the journey of healing the little girl inside so that the woman they are could live free and in purpose. Thank you for trusting me with your hearts ❤🥰❤\nThen we planned to continue the work in person this March and then God allowed a shift to take place. \nAnd what a shift this has been. 🤯😳😷 We have experienced loss on every level. So jolting that it caused some to freeze and become still, steady and quiet. And that is where I have been and what I have been doing. In the beginning my silence and stillness from posting here made me feel guilty. Then the quiet made me listen more intently to purpose, process and position. I then steadied myself to clearly listen to what God wants from me in this season. \n\nHe has given me some charges to keep. If you are still with me let's continue to push and heal together ❤ \nWe won't be able to share physical space at this time. But we can work the heck out of this virtual space. Feel free to post a 💛 if you want to stay on the journey. \n\nStill in position to do that hard heart work that frees us to be who God has already ordained us to be. Proverbs 4:23 remains our anchor \"Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it.\"\n\nMy love to you all H3 Family!!! 💛💛💛My prayers to you and your loved ones always. 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼\n#HealHerHeart\n#wearyourmask\n#washyourhands\n#socialdistance\n#praycontinually","NumberOfLikes":6,"Hashtags":["#HealHerHeart","#wearyourmask","#washyourhands","#socialdistance","#praycontinually"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Gilleyan on August 18, 2020.

For patients recovering at home, treatment is mainly #supportive. For people with #mild symptoms, this means staying well rested, drinking plenty of fluids, and monitoring symptoms. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever or chills, cough, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, runny nose or congestion, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea. Some people have more severe symptoms that require hospitalization.\n\nWhat Is Preventive Care?\n\nYou can be infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) while taking care of someone with COVID-19. Although there is not yet a vaccine to prevent COVID-19, infection is preventable. The most important steps to #prevent spread are wearing a #mask, maintaining #socialdistance whenever possible, #washinghands often, and #cleaning and #sanitizing the home.\n\nFor More Information\n* \tCaring for someone sick (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC])\u2028www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/if-you-are-sick\/care-for-someone.html\n* \tClinical care guidance (CDC)\u2028www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/hcp\/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html","NumberOfLikes":26,"Hashtags":["#cure","#COVID-19),","#supportive.","#mild","#prevent","#mask,","#socialdistance","#washinghands","#cleaning","#sanitizing"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Dr Sandhya Ramanathan on August 17, 2020.

I get it!\n☆\nI did my very best to be cautious and careful, and many of my clothes were no longer fitting because of gaining some Covd weight.\n☆\nSo...I made the decision to give it a try.

But it ended up being awesome.\n☆\nAnd I wanna share what I found and how I kept as safe as possible!!!\n☆\nIt's really hard to decide which businesses to go to and which to avoid.

If you asked me, \u201CWhat Top 10 upside TE can I wait for late in my draft?\u201D, my answer would be Chris Herndon. \nIn 2018, he joined George Kittle, Zach Ertz, Mark Andrews, Rob Gronkowski, Hunter Henry, and Noah Fant as the only rookie TEs to average at least 8 yards per target since 2000. \nWhat did he do since his rookie year? I\u2019m glad you asked because he didn\u2019t just merely lose his job. Rather, he was injured and suspended between the last two seasons. I totally understand if you owned Herndon last year and he burned you like Usher. Believe me, I get it. Because of his stat line (1 reception for 7 yards) he\u2019s basically free for fantasy owners in 2020. People are afraid to move him up their boards, and rightly so. \nOne of the great things about fantasy (and football\/sports in general) is that it pays to have a short term memory. \nGase and company have been licking their chops at the thought of having Herndon back this year. There isn\u2019t a set pecking order for Darnold, so he can grow into their leading pass catcher as the season progresses. This was certainly the case in Herndon\u2019s rookie year. He and Darnold had and still have a great rapport on the field. \nWhat I\u2019m not saying is that Herndon should easily be your starter. Yes, he could earn his way into being that (I believe that he will), but he should be your second TE selection late , as he\u2019s going as low as the TE21 (PPR) in his ADP. Also, fantasy owners should never take the \u201CI\u2019m staying away from this entire team\u201D approach when it comes to TEs because as porous as the Jets have been, they\u2019ve trailed in many games and have been forced to air it out. What this TE class tells us is that you can stand to take a risk late if you can pull a Herndon(Jarwin, Irv. and Jonnu Smith). Gase is already all about chucking it down field. Keep your eyes peeled for Herndon LATE late. \n\n🎥: New York Jets (Youtube) \n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n#ChrisHerndon #TE2 #Jets #NY #nfl #fantasy #YourFantasyDoctor #nflmeme #SleeperoftheWeek #FantasyHelp #breakout #socialdistance #MIAMI #SamDarnold #sportsclips #Coldweatherfootball #fantasyhelp #footballtutor #mockdrafthelp #ESPNfantasy #Yahoofantasy","NumberOfLikes":90,"Hashtags":["#ChrisHerndon","#TE2","#Jets","#NY","#nfl","#fantasy","#YourFantasyDoctor","#nflmeme","#SleeperoftheWeek","#FantasyHelp","#breakout","#socialdistance","#MIAMI","#SamDarnold","#sportsclips","#Coldweatherfootball","#fantasyhelp","#footballtutor","#mockdrafthelp","#ESPNfantasy","#Yahoofantasy"],"AccessibilityCaption":null,"NumberOfComments":29,"Timestamp":1597669817,"LocalDate":"Mon Aug 17 15:10:17 CEST 2020","Location":"MetLife Stadium"},{"Owner":"surfcityfarmersmarket","CaptionText":"PICK UP OUR FARMERS MARKET TOTE BAG! $10 at the Firehouse Table at the Surf City Farmers Market, 9am-Noon every Monday through September 28!\n\n@surfcityfire49 \n#farmersmarket #surfcityfarmersmarket #surfcitynj\n#buylocal #eatyourveggies #homegrown #maskup #socialdistance #besafe","NumberOfLikes":20,"Hashtags":["#farmersmarket","#surfcityfarmersmarket","#surfcitynj","#buylocal","#eatyourveggies","#homegrown","#maskup","#socialdistance","#besafe"],"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Surf City Farmers Market in Surf City Volunteer Fire Company.

In year 22 leading up to 23 I was able to turn my Bestfriend into my boyfriend, move to a whole next state, learn more about him and his family, get our own apartment, save money, slowly but surely getting to open my own business (@noire_royal), learn how to drive not one forklift but two different types(thanks to my amazing mentor\/work mom), become a server, and now being store manager at sneaker\/clothing store, which if you know me you know I love both. All of these things have come to be from manifesting, perseverance, and overcoming my own internal struggles. I\u2019m grateful to have made it to year 23 and excited for many more years to come. Hopefully in year 23 I\u2019m able to complete the goals I\u2019ve set for myself despite this pandemic and inspire others. I\u2019m still working on being more positive and spreading positivity.
