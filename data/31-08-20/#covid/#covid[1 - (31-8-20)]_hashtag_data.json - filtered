I've never seen an episode of the Kardashian's and have no clue what their names are but I'll you why 9\/11 was inside job and how fluoride is destroying your brain. There is a growing and disturbing trend of overall ignorance in American culture. It\u2019s the dismissal of logic, common sense and humanity and their replaced by entertainment, sedation, ignorance and deliberate gullibility.\u2063\n\u2063\nRational thought is now the enemy. Critical thinking is the devil\u2019s tool. The herd mentality has taken over, the anti-intellectuals become the metaphorical equivalent of an angry lynch mob when anyone either challenges one of the mob beliefs or says anything outside the mob\u2019s self-limiting set of values. People accept without questioning, believe without weighing the choices and join the pack because in a culture where convenience rules, real individualism is too much work. Thinking takes too much time for most people\u2026it gets in their way of trying to fit in.\u2063\n\u2063\nBeing mindful and aware of what is really happening is both a blessing and a burden. It is frustrating to know that there is very little that is in my control but there is no way I would surrender to a life of conforming and ignorance, giving into the consumer culture that has been portrayed as the illusion of freedom when really, we are only creating more suffering for ourselves because we all know intuitively that materialism, drugs, alcohol, toxic pharmaceuticals etc\u2026are temporary void fillers that keep us dis-empowered and vulnerable to the mental slavery they try to program into us.","NumberOfLikes":37,"Hashtags":null,"AccessibilityCaption":"Photo by Chris Kirckof on August 31, 2020.

But the reality is otherwise, Vitamin C is essential to cleanse the body. Mucus is formed within the body and once this mucus is beyond what the body can handle, it results in allergies like wheeze, asthma, rhinitis, pollen dust etc.\n\nI advised him to consume citrus food (Vitamin C), every single day. 🍊🍋\n.\n.\nAnd Guess What❓\n. \n.\nAfter 2 months of treatment, the allergy was no more\u203C️\n\nExample: Just as we clean dirty vessels with a fibre scrub\/lemon likewise our body needs fibre and citrus to remove the excess Mucus.\n\nMy simple Mantra to cure my patients: Nutrition and lifestyle change can cure any chronic disease.
